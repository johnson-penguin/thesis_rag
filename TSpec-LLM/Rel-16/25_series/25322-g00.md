4.1 Objective
-------------

This subclause describes the architecture of the RLC sublayer.

4.2 Overview of the RLC sublayer architecture
---------------------------------------------

The model presented in this subclause is intended to support the
definition of the RLC sublayer only, and is not meant to specify or
constrain the implementation of the protocol. The RLC sublayer consists
of RLC entities, of which there are three types: Transparent Mode (TM),
Unacknowledged Mode (UM), and Acknowledged Mode (AM) RLC entities.

### 4.2.1 Model of the RLC sublayer

Figure 4.1 illustrates different RLC entities in the RLC model.

An UM and a TM RLC entity can be configured to be a transmitting RLC
entity or a receiving RLC entity. The transmitting RLC entity transmits
RLC PDUs and the receiving RLC entity receives RLC PDUs. An AM RLC
entity consists of a transmitting side, and a receiving side, where the
transmitting side of the AM RLC entity transmits RLC PDUs and the
receiving side of the AM RLC entity receives RLC PDUs.

Elementary procedures (see clause 11) are defined between a \"Sender\"
and a \"Receiver\". In UM and TM, the transmitting RLC entity acts as a
Sender and the peer RLC entity acts as a Receiver. An AM RLC entity acts
either as a Sender or as a Receiver depending on the elementary
procedure. The Sender is the transmitter of AMD PDUs and the Receiver is
the receiver of AMD PDUs. A Sender or a Receiver can reside at either
the UE or the UTRAN.

There is one transmitting and one receiving RLC entity for each
transparent mode (TM) and unacknowledged mode (UM) service. There is one
combined, transmitting and receiving entity for the acknowledged mode
(AM) service.

In the present document, \"transmitted\" is equivalent to \"submitted to
the lower layer\" unless otherwise explicitly stated. Each RLC UM, and
TM entity uses one logical channel to send or receive data PDUs. An AM
RLC entity can be configured to use one or two logical channels to send
or receive data and control PDUs. If two logical channels are
configured, they are of the same type (DCCH or DTCH). In figure 4.1, the
dashed lines between the AM-Entities illustrate the possibility to send
and receive RLC PDUs on separate logical channels, e.g. control PDUs on
one and data PDUs on the other. A more detailed description of the
different entities is given in subclauses 4.2.1.1, 4.2.1.2 and 4.2.1.3.

Figure 4.1: Overview model of the RLC sublayer

#### 4.2.1.1 Transparent mode (TM) RLC entities

Figure 4.2 below shows the model of two transparent mode peer RLC
entities. The logical channels used to communicate with the lower layer
are described in the figure below.

Figure 4.2: Model of two transparent mode peer entities

##### 4.2.1.1.1 Transmitting TM RLC entity

The transmitting TM-RLC entity receives RLC SDUs from upper layers
through the TM-SAP.

All received RLC SDUs must be of a length that is a multiple of one of
the valid TMD PDU lengths.

If segmentation has been configured by upper layers and a RLC SDU is
larger than the TMD PDU size used by the lower layer for that TTI, the
transmitting TM RLC entity segments RLC SDUs to fit the TMD PDUs size
without adding RLC headers. All the TMD PDUs carrying one RLC SDU are
sent in the same TTI, and no segment from another RLC SDU are sent in
this TTI.

If segmentation has not been configured by upper layers, then more than
one RLC SDU can be sent in one TTI by placing one RLC SDU in one TMD
PDU. All TMD PDUs in one TTI must be of equal length.

When the processing of a RLC SDU is complete, the resulting one or more
TMD PDU(s) are/is submitted to the lower layer through either a BCCH,
DCCH, PCCH, CCCH, SHCCH or a DTCH logical channel.

##### 4.2.1.1.2 Receiving TM RLC entity

The receiving TM-RLC entity receives TMD PDUs through the configured
logical channels from the lower layer. If segmentation is configured by
upper layers, all TMD PDUs received within one TTI are reassembled to
form the RLC SDU.

If segmentation is not configured by upper layers, each TMD PDU is
treated as a RLC SDU.

The receiving TM RLC entity delivers RLC SDUs to upper layers through
the TM-SAP.

#### 4.2.1.2 Unacknowledged mode (UM) RLC entities

Figure 4.3 below shows the model of two unacknowledged mode peer RLC
entities when duplicate avoidance and reordering is not configured. The
different functions shown in Figure 4.3 below apply to different logical
channel types as described in subclause 6.1.

Figure 4.3: Model of two unacknowledged mode peer entities configured
for use without duplicate avoidance and reordering

Figure 4.3a below shows the model of two unacknowledged mode peer RLC
entities configured for duplicate avoidance and reordering. Because
duplicate avoidance and reordering is only specified for MTCH/CCCH in
this release, ciphering/ deciphering is omitted.

Figure 4.3a: Model of two unacknowledged mode peer entities configured
for use with duplicate avoidance and reordering

##### 4.2.1.2.1 Transmitting UM RLC entity

The transmitting UM-RLC entity receives RLC SDUs from upper layers
through the UM-SAP.

The transmitting UM RLC entity segments the RLC SDU into UMD PDUs of
appropriate size, if the RLC SDU is larger than the length of available
space in the UMD PDU. The size of the UMD PDUs after segmentation and/or
concatenation shall be smaller than or equal to the largest UL UMD PDU
size. If MAC-i/is has been configured and the RLC PDU size is set to
\"flexible size\", the size of the UMD PDUs after segmentation and/or
concatenation shall be larger than or equal to the Minimum UL RLC PDU
size. If data to be transmitted is not enough to create a UMD PDU of the
minimum size, it is allowed to create a UMD PDU including all data to be
transmitted, even if the resulting size is smaller than the Minimum UL
RLC PDU size. The UMD PDU may contain segmented and/or concatenated RLC
SDUs. UMD PDU may also contain padding to ensure that it is of a valid
length. Length Indicators are used to define boundaries between RLC SDUs
within UMD PDUs unless the \"Extension bit\" already indicates that a
UMD PDU contains exactly one complete SDU. Length Indicators are also
used to define whether Padding is included in the UMD PDU.

If ciphering is configured and started, an UMD PDU is ciphered (except
for the UMD PDU header) before it is submitted to the lower layer.

The transmitting UM RLC entity submits UMD PDUs to the lower layer
through either a CCCH, SHCCH, DCCH, CTCH, DTCH, MCCH, MSCH or an MTCH
logical channel.

##### 4.2.1.2.2 Receiving UM RLC entity

The receiving UM-RLC entity receives UMD PDUs through the configured
logical channels from the lower layer. When duplicate avoidance and
reordering is configured there may be one or more than one input from
the lower layer. Inputs can be added or removed without changing the
buffer contents, state variables or timers within the receiving UM RLC
entity. Where duplicate avoidance and reordering is not configured there
is only one input from the lower layer and it is not reconfigured.

When configured, duplicate avoidance and reordering is the first receive
function that is applied to the input UMD PDU streams in the receiving
UM RLC entity. It can only be configured in a UE, it is not used in
UTRAN. It completes duplicate detection and re-ordering of the UMD PDUs
that are received from the one or more inputs to produce a single
ordered sequence of PDUs that is passed to the next in sequence RLC
receiver function.

The receiving UM RLC entity deciphers (if ciphering is configured and
started) the received UMD PDUs (except for the UMD PDU header). It
removes RLC headers from received UMD PDUs, and reassembles RLC SDUs (if
segmentation and/or concatenation has been performed by the transmitting
UM RLC entity).

If a receiving UM RLC entity is configured for out of sequence SDU
delivery, it will reassemble SDUs and transfer them to the upper layers
as soon as all PDUs that contain the SDU have been received even if
earlier PDUs have not yet been received. It will store PDUs pending the
retransmission of missing PDUs by the transmitting UM RLC. PDUs are
removed from storage after recovery of all of its associated SDUs, or by
a sequence number window function or a storage timer. Out of sequence
SDU delivery is configured only in the UE and is only used with MCCH.

RLC SDUs are delivered by the receiving UM RLC entity to the upper
layers through the UM-SAP. If SN\_Delivery is configured, the sequence
number of RLC PDU in which RLC SDU is mapped to is also delivered to the
upper layers through the UM-SAP.

#### 4.2.1.3 Acknowledged mode (AM) RLC entity

Figure 4.4 below shows the model of an acknowledged mode RLC entity.

The AM RLC entity can be configured to utilise one or two logical
channels. The figure 4.4 shows the model of the AM RLC entity when one
logical channel (shown as a solid line) and when two logical channels
(shown as dashed lines) are used.

If one logical channel is configured, the transmitting side of the AM
RLC entity submits AMD and Control PDUs to the lower layer on that
logical channel. If fixed RLC PDU size is configured the RLC PDU size
shall be the same for AMD PDUs and control PDUs. If flexible RLC PDU
size is configured the AMD PDU size is variable up to a maximum RLC PDU
size.

In case two logical channels are configured in the uplink, AMD PDUs and
control PDUs except acknowledgement status report, MRW ACK SUFI and
WINDOW SUFI shall be transmitted on the first logical channel, and
acknowledgement status reports, MRW ACK SUFI and WINDOW SUFI shall be
transmitted on the second logical channel. In case two logical channels
are configured in the downlink, AMD and Control PDUs can be transmitted
on any of the two logical channels.

Figure 4.4: Model of an acknowledged mode entity

##### 4.2.1.3.1 Transmitting side

The transmitting side of the AM-RLC entity receives RLC SDUs from upper
layers through the AM-SAP.

If fixed RLC PDU size is configured, RLC SDUs are segmented and/or
concatenated into AMD PDUs of a fixed length. The segmentation is
performed if the received RLC SDU is larger than the length of available
space in the AMD PDU. The uplink AMD PDU size is a semi-static value
that is configured by upper layers and can only be changed through
re-establishment of the AM RLC entity by upper layers.

If flexible RLC PDU size is configured, RLC SDUs are segmented and/or
concatenated to create RLC PDUs larger than or equal to the Minimum UL
RLC PDU size and smaller than or equal to the largest UL AMD PDU size.
If data to be transmitted is not enough to create an AMD PDU of the
minimum size, it is allowed to create an AMD PDU including all data to
be transmitted, even if the resulting size is smaller than the Minimum
UL RLC PDU size.

NOTE: In downlink, if flexible RLC PDU size is configured, RLC SDUs are
segmented if the SDU is larger than the maximum RLC PDU size.
Concatenation may be performed up to the maximum RLC PDU size.

The AMD PDU may contain segmented and/or concatenated RLC SDUs. The AMD
PDU may also contain Padding to ensure that it is of a valid size. If
fixed RLC PDU size is configured, Length Indicators or a special value
of the HE field can be used to define boundaries between RLC SDUs within
AMD PDUs. Length Indicators are also used to define whether Padding or
Piggybacked STATUS PDU is included in the AMD PDU. If flexible RLC PDU
size is configured, the Length Indicator size is configured by upper
layers. The use of the special value of the HE field is configured by
higher layers.

After the segmentation and/or concatenation are performed, the AMD PDUs
are placed in the Retransmission buffer and at the MUX.

AMD PDUs buffered in the Retransmission buffer are deleted or
retransmitted based on the status report found within a STATUS PDU or
Piggybacked STATUS PDU sent by the peer AM RLC entity. This status
report may contain positive or negative acknowledgements of individual
AMD PDUs received by the peer AM RLC entity.

The MUX multiplexes AMD PDUs from the Retransmission buffer that need to
be retransmitted, and the newly generated AMD PDUs delivered from the
Segmentation/Concatenation function.

The PDUs are delivered to the function that completes the AMD PDU header
and potentially replaces padding with piggybacked status information. A
Piggybacked STATUS PDUs can be of variable size in order to match the
amount of free space in the AMD PDU. The AMD PDU header is completed
based on the input from the RLC Control Unit that indicates the values
to set in various fields (e.g. Polling Bit). The function also
multiplexes, if required, Control PDUs received from the RLC Control
Unit (RESET and RESET ACK PDUs), and from the Reception buffer
(Piggybacked STATUS and STATUS PDUs), with AMD PDUs.

The ciphering (if configured) is then applied to the AMD PDUs. The AMD
PDU header is not ciphered. Piggybacked STATUS PDU and Padding in AMD
PDU (when present) are ciphered. Control PDUs (i.e. STATUS PDU, RESET
PDU, and RESET ACK PDU) are not ciphered.

The transmitting side of the AM RLC entity submits AMD PDUs to the lower
layer through either one or two DCCH or DTCH logical channels.

##### 4.2.1.3.2 Receiving side

The receiving side of the AM-RLC entity receives AMD and Control PDUs
through the configured logical channels from the lower layer.

If fixed RLC PDU size is configured, the AMD PDU size is a semi-static
value that is configured by upper layers and can only be changed through
re-establishment of the AM RLC entity by upper layers. In the case where
the AMD PDU size is not configured, it is determined based on the first
PDU received. The downlink and uplink AMD PDU sizes need not be the
same.

If flexible RLC PDU size is configured, the AMD PDU size is variable up
to the maximum RLC PDU size, and the Length Indicator size is configured
by upper layers.

AMD PDUs are routed to the Deciphering Unit, where AMD PDUs (minus the
AMD PDU header) are deciphered (if ciphering is configured and started),
and then delivered to the Reception buffer.

The AMD PDUs are placed in the Reception buffer until a complete RLC SDU
has been received. The Receiver acknowledges successful reception or
requests retransmission of the missing AMD PDUs by sending one or more
STATUS PDUs to the AM RLC peer entity, through its transmitting side. If
a Piggybacked STATUS PDU is found in an AMD PDU, it is delivered to the
Retransmission buffer & Management Unit at the transmitting side of the
AM RLC entity, in order to purge the buffer of positively acknowledged
AMD PDUs, and to indicate which AMD PDUs need to be retransmitted.

Once a complete RLC SDU has been received, the associated AMD PDUs are
reassembled by the Reassembly Unit and delivered to upper layers through
the AM-SAP.

RESET and RESET ACK PDUs are delivered to the RLC Control Unit for
processing. If a response to the peer AM RLC entity is needed, an
appropriate Control PDU is delivered, by the RLC Control Unit to the
transmitting side of the AM RLC entity. The received STATUS PDUs are
delivered to the Retransmission buffer and Management Unit at the
transmitting side of the AM RLC entity, in order to purge the buffer of
positively acknowledged AMD PDUs, and to indicate which AMD PDUs need to
be retransmitted.

8 Elements for layer-to-layer communication
===========================================

The interaction between the RLC sublayer and other layers are described
in terms of primitives where the primitives represent the logical
exchange of information and control between the RLC sublayer and other
layers. The primitives shall not specify or constrain the
implementation.

**RLC-AM-DATA-Req/Ind/Conf**

\- RLC-AM-DATA-Req is used by upper layers to request transmission of an
RLC SDU in acknowledged mode.

\- RLC-AM-DATA-Ind is used by the AM RLC entity to deliver to upper
layers an RLC SDU that has been transmitted in acknowledged mode and to
indicate to upper layers of the discarded RLC SDU in the peer RLC AM
entity.

\- RLC-AM-DATA-Conf is used by the AM RLC entity to confirm to upper
layers the reception of an RLC SDU by the peer-RLC AM entity or to
inform the upper layers of a discarded SDU.

**RLC-UM-DATA-Req/Ind/Conf**

\- RLC-UM-DATA-Req is used by upper layers to request transmission of an
RLC SDU in unacknowledged mode.

\- RLC-UM-DATA-Ind is used by the UM RLC entity to deliver to upper
layers an RLC SDU that has been transmitted in unacknowledged mode. If
SN\_Delivery is configured, RLC-UM-DATA-Ind is used by the UM RLC entity
to deliver to upper layers also Sequence\_Number.

\- RLC-UM-DATA-Conf is used by the UM RLC entity to inform the upper
layers of a discarded SDU.

**RLC-TM-DATA-Req/Ind/Conf**

\- RLC-TM-DATA-Req is used by upper layers to request transmission of an
RLC SDU in transparent mode.

\- RLC-TM-DATA-Ind is used by the TM RLC entity to deliver to upper
layers an RLC SDU that has been transmitted in transparent mode.

\- RLC-TM-DATA-Conf is used by the TM RLC entity to inform the upper
layers of a discarded SDU.

**CRLC-CONFIG-Req**

This primitive is used by upper layers to establish, re-establish,
release, stop, continue or modify the RLC. Ciphering elements are
included for UM and AM operation.

**CRLC-SUSPEND-Req/Conf**

\- CRLC-SUSPEND-Req is used by upper layers to suspend the UM or AM RLC
entity.

\- CRLC-SUSPEND-Conf is used by the UM or AM RLC entity to confirm that
the entity is suspended.

**CRLC-RESUME-Req**

This primitive is used by upper layers to resume the UM or AM RLC entity
after the UM or AM RLC entity has been suspended.

**CRLC-STATUS-Ind**

It is used by an RLC entity to send status information to upper layers.

8.2 Primitive parameters
------------------------

Following parameters are used in the primitives:

1\) The parameter Data is the RLC SDU that is mapped onto the Data field
in RLC PDUs. When AM or UM RLC entities are used, the length of the Data
parameter is a multiple of 8 bits, otherwise (TM RLC entity) the length
of Data parameter is a bit-string whose length may not be a multiple of
8 bits.

2\) The parameter Confirmation Request (CNF) indicates whether the
transmitting side of the AM RLC entity needs to confirm the reception of
the RLC SDU by the peer-RLC AM entity. If required, once all AMD PDUs
that make up the RLC SDU are positively acknowledged by the receiving AM
RLC entity, the transmitting AM RLC entity notifies upper layers.

3\) The parameter Message Unit Identifier (MUI) is an identity of the
RLC SDU, which is used to indicate which RLC SDU that is confirmed with
the RLC-AM-DATA-Conf. primitive, or discarded with the
RLC-AM/UM/TM-DATA-Conf. Primitive.

4\) The parameter E/R indicates establishment, re-establishment, release
or modification of an RLC entity, where re-establishment is applicable
to AM and UM RLC entities only. If re-establishment is requested, the
state variables and configurable parameters are initialised according to
subclause 9.7.7. If release is requested, all protocol parameters,
variables and timers are released and the RLC entity enters the NULL
state. If modification is requested, the protocol parameters indicated
by upper layers (e.g. ciphering parameters) are only modified, while
keeping the other protocol parameters, such as the protocol variables,
protocol timers and protocol state unchanged. AM RLC entities are always
re-established if any of the uplink or downlink AMD PDU size is changed.
The modification of other protocol parameters does not require a
re-establishment.

5\) The parameter Event Code (EVC) indicates the reason for the
CRLC-STATUS-Ind e.g., unrecoverable errors such as data link layer loss
or recoverable status events such as reset.

6\) The parameter Ciphering Elements are only applicable for UM and AM
operations. These parameters are Ciphering Mode, Ciphering Key,
Transmitting Activation Time (Sequence Number to activate a new
ciphering configuration at the Sender), Receiving Activation Time
(Sequence Number to activate a new ciphering configuration at the
Receiver) and HFN (Hyper Frame Number).

7\) The AM\_parameters are only applicable for AM operation. These
parameters are AMD PDU size, which can be either a fixed value or set to
flexible size, largest UL AMD PDU size (only used when flexible PDU size
is configured by upper layers, see subclause 9.2.2.8), Length Indicator
Size, In-sequence Delivery Indication (indicating that RLC SDUs are
delivered to upper layers in sequence or that they can be delivered out
of sequence), Timer values (see subclause 9.5), Use of a special value
of the HE field (see subclause 9.2.2.7), Protocol parameter values (see
subclause 9.6), Polling triggers (see subclause 9.7.1), Status triggers
(see subclause 9.7.2), Periodical Status blocking configuration (see
subclause 9.7.2), SDU discard mode (see subclause 9.7.3), Minimum WSN
(see subclause 9.2.2.11.3), and Send MRW. The Minimum WSN is always
greater than or equal to the number of transport blocks in the smallest
transport block set. The Send MRW indicates that the information of each
discarded RLC SDU is sent to the Receiver, and the MRW SUFI is sent to
the Receiver even if no segments of the RLC SDU to be discarded were
submitted to a lower layer.

8\) The parameter DiscardInfo indicates to upper layer the discarded RLC
SDU in the peer-RLC AM entity. It is applicable only when in-sequence
delivery is configured and it is to be used when upper layers require
the reliable data transfer.

9\) The Stop parameter is applicable to AM and UM RLC entities only and
indicates to the RLC entity to (see subclause 9.7.6):

\- not transmit nor receive any RLC PDUs.

10\) The Continue parameter is applicable to AM and UM RLC entities only
and indicates to the RLC entity to continue transmission and reception
of RLC PDUs.

11\) The UM\_parameters are only applicable for UM operation. It
contains Timer\_Discard value (see subclause 9.5), use Alternative E-bit
interpretation (see subclause 9.2.2.5), largest UL UMD PDU size (see
subclause 9.2.2.8), DL RLC UM LI size (see subclause 9.2.2.8) and
SN\_Delivery. For a receiving UM RLC in a UE, an additional parameter
indicating use/ no use of out of sequence SDU delivery is included (see
subclause 11.2.3.2). If out of sequence SDU delivery is used, the
parameters OSD\_Window\_Size (see subclause 9.6) and the timeout value
of Timer\_OSD (see subclause 9.5) are included. For a receiving UM RLC
in a UE, an additional parameter indicating use/ no use of duplicate
avoidance and reordering is included (see subclause 9.7.10). If
duplicate avoidance and reordering is used, the parameters
DAR\_Window\_Size (see subclause 9.6) and the timeout value of
Timer\_DAR (see subclause 9.5) are included. If out-of-sequence support
is configured, the parameter Configured\_Rx\_Window\_Size is included.
If SN\_Delivery parameter is configured, the receiving RLC entity
delivers an RLC SDU with Sequence\_Number to the upper layers. When
SN\_Delivery parameter is configured, the DL transmitting RLC entity
should neither concatenate nor segment RLC SDUs, the UL transmitting RLC
entity shall not concatenate RLC SDUs and may segment RLC SDUs.

12\) The TM\_parameters are only applicable for TM operation. It
contains e.g. segmentation indication (see subclauses 9.2.2.9 and
11.1.2.1), Timer\_Discard value (see subclause 9.5) and delivery of
erroneous SDU indication (see subclause 11.1.3).

13\) The N parameter indicates that an RLC entity will not send a PDU
with \"Sequence Number\"\>=VT(S)+N for AM and \"Sequence
Number\"\>=VT(US)+N for UM, where N is a non-negative integer.

> 14\) The VT(S) parameter indicates the value of the Send State
> Variable for the case of the AM.
>
> 15\) The VT(US) parameter indicates the value of the UM Data State
> Variable, for the case of the UM.
>
> 16\) The Error\_Indicator parameter indicates that the RLC SDU is
> erroneous (see subclause 11.1.3).

17\) The parameter UE-ID type indicator indicates the RNTI type (U-RNTI
or C-RNTI) to be used for the associated RLC SDU. This parameter is not
required at the UE.

18\) The parameter DiscardReq indicates whether the transmitting RLC
entity needs to inform the upper layers of the discarded RLC SDU. If
required, the transmitting RLC entity notifies upper layers when the SDU
is discarded.

19\) The parameter Status is only applicable for AM operation. This
parameter indicates whether a RLC SDU is successfully transmitted or
discarded.

20\) The parameter Sequence\_Number is the value that is mapped onto the
Sequence Number (SN) field in an RLC PDU. It is applicable only for UM
operation when SN\_Delivery is configured for the UMD RLC entity.

21\) The parameter Minimum UL PDU size is applicable for AM and UM
operation in the uplink. The Minimum UL PDU size determines the smallest
size of the RLC AMD or UMD PDU after segmentation or concatenation (see
section 9.2.2.9). If data to be transmitted is not enough to create a
PDU of the minimum size, it is allowed to create a PDU including all
data to be transmitted, even if the resulting size is smaller than the
Minimum UL RLC PDU size.

9 Elements for peer-to-peer communication
=========================================

9.1 Protocol data units
-----------------------

The structures defined in this subclause are normative.

### 9.1.1 Data PDUs

a\) TMD PDU (Transparent Mode Data PDU).

The TMD PDU is used to convey RLC SDU data without adding any RLC
overhead. The TMD PDU is used by RLC when it is in transparent mode.

b\) UMD PDU (Unacknowledged Mode Data PDU).

The UMD PDU is used to convey sequentially numbered PDUs containing RLC
SDU data. UMD PDUs are used by RLC when it is configured for
unacknowledged data transfer.

c\) AMD PDU (Acknowledged Mode Data PDU).

The AMD PDU is used to convey sequentially numbered PDUs containing RLC
SDU data. AMD PDUs are used by RLC when it is configured for
acknowledged data transfer.

### 9.1.2 Control PDUs

Control PDUs are only used in acknowledged mode.

a\) STATUS PDU and Piggybacked STATUS PDU.

The STATUS PDU and the Piggybacked STATUS PDU are used:

\- by the Receiver to inform the Sender about missing and received AMD
PDUs in the Receiver;

\- by the Receiver to inform the Sender about the size of the allowed
transmission window;

\- by the Sender to request the Receiver to move the reception window;
and

\- by the Receiver to acknowledge the Sender about the reception of the
request to move the reception window.

b\) RESET PDU.

The RESET PDU is used to reset all protocol states, protocol variables
and protocol timers of the peer RLC entity in order to synchronise the
two peer entities. It is sent by the Sender to the Receiver.

c\) RESET ACK PDU.

The RESET ACK PDU is an acknowledgement to the RESET PDU. It is sent by
the Receiver to the Sender.

9.2 Formats and parameters
--------------------------

The formats of RLC PDUs and their parameters defined in this subclause
are normative.

### 9.2.1 Formats

This subclause specifies the format of the RLC PDUs. The parameters of
each RLC PDU are explained in subclause 9.2.2.

#### 9.2.1.1 General

An RLC PDU is a bit string. In the figures in subclause 9.2, bit strings
are represented by tables in which the first bit is the leftmost one on
the first line of the table, the last bit is the rightmost one on the
last line of the table, and more generally the bit string is to be read
from left to right and then in the reading order of the lines.

Depending on the provided service, RLC SDUs are bit strings, with any
non-null length, or bit strings with a multiple of 8 bits in length. An
RLC SDU is included into an RLC PDU from first bit onward.

#### 9.2.1.2 TMD PDU

The TMD PDU is used to transfer user data when RLC is operating in
transparent mode. No overhead is added to the SDU by RLC. The data
length is not constrained to be a multiple of 8 bits.

Figure 9.1: TMD PDU

#### 9.2.1.3 UMD PDU

The UMD PDU is used to transfer user data when RLC is operating in
unacknowledged mode. The length of the data part shall be a multiple of
8 bits. The UMD PDU header consists of the first octet, which contains
the \"Sequence Number\". The RLC header consists of the first octet and
all the octets that contain \"Length Indicators\".

Figure 9.2: UMD PDU

NOTE (1): The \"Length Indicator\" may be 15 bits.

#### 9.2.1.4 AMD PDU

The AMD PDU is used to transfer user data, piggybacked status
information and the Polling bit when RLC is operating in acknowledged
mode. The length of the data part shall be a multiple of 8 bits. The AMD
PDU header consists of the first two octets, which contain the
\"Sequence Number\". The RLC header consists of the first two octets and
all the octets that contain \"Length Indicators\".

Figure 9.3: AMD PDU

NOTE (1): The \"Length Indicator\" may be 15 bits.

#### 9.2.1.5 STATUS PDU

The STATUS PDU is used to exchange status information between two RLC AM
entities.

The format of the STATUS PDU is given in figure 9.4 below. The length of
each super field (SUFI) is dependent on its type and contents.

Figure 9.4: STATUS PDU

A STATUS PDU can include super-fields of different types. The size of a
STATUS PDU is variable and upper bounded by the maximum RLC PDU size
used by the logical channel on which the control PDUs are sent. If fixed
RLC PDU size has been configured by upper layers, padding shall be
included to match one of the PDU sizes used by the logical channel on
which the control PDUs are sent. The length of the STATUS PDU shall be a
multiple of 8 bits. If flexible RLC PDU size has been configured by
upper layers padding is only included to make the length of the STATUS
PDU a multiple of 8 bits.

#### 9.2.1.6 Piggybacked STATUS PDU

The format of the piggybacked STATUS PDU is the same as for the STATUS
PDU except that the D/C field is replaced by a reserved bit (R2). This
PDU can be piggybacked in an AMD PDU if the data leaves out enough room
in the AMD PDU. The PDU Type field is set to \"000\" and all other
values are invalid for this version of the protocol.

Figure 9.5: Piggybacked STATUS PDU

#### 9.2.1.7 RESET, RESET ACK PDU

The RESET PDU includes a one-bit sequence number field (RSN). The value
of this bit is carried over in the RESET ACK PDU sent in response in
order to allow the peer entity to identify which RESET PDU it was sent
in response to.

Figure 9.6: RESET, RESET ACK PDU

The size of a RESET or RESET ACK PDU is variable and upper bounded by
the maximum RLC PDU size used by the logical channel on which the
control PDUs are sent. If fixed RLC PDU size has been configured by
upper layers, padding shall be included to match one of the PDU sizes
used by the logical channel on which the control PDUs are sent. The
length of the RESET or RESET ACK PDU shall be a multiple of 8 bits. If
flexible RLC PDU size has been configured by upper layers padding is
only included to make the length of the RESET or RESET ACK PDU a
multiple of 8 bits.

### 9.2.2 Parameters

If not otherwise mentioned in the definition of each field, the bits in
the parameters shall be interpreted as follows: the left-most bit string
is the first and most significant and the right most bit is the last and
least significant bit.

Unless otherwise mentioned, integers are encoded in standard binary
encoding for unsigned integers. In all cases, including when a value
extends over more than one octet as shown in the tables, the bits appear
ordered from MSB to LSB when read in the RLC PDU.

#### 9.2.2.1 D/C field

Length: 1bit.

The D/C field indicates the type of an AM PDU. It can be either data or
control PDU.

  ----- -------------
  Bit   Description
  0     Control PDU
  1     Data PDU
  ----- -------------

#### 9.2.2.2 PDU Type

Length: 3 bit.

The PDU type field indicates the Control PDU type.

  --------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Bit       PDU Type
  000       STATUS
  001       RESET
  010       RESET ACK
  011-111   Reserved (PDUs with this coding will be discarded by this version of the protocol).
  --------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### 9.2.2.3 Sequence Number (SN)

This field indicates the \"Sequence Number\" of the RLC PDU, encoded in
binary.

  ---------- --------- ----------------------------------------
  PDU type   Length    Notes
  AMD PDU    12 bits   Used for retransmission and reassembly
  UMD PDU    7 bits    Used for reassembly
  ---------- --------- ----------------------------------------

#### 9.2.2.4 Polling bit (P)

Length: 1bit.

This field is used to request a status report (one or several STATUS
PDUs) from the Receiver.

  ----- -----------------------------
  Bit   Description
  0     Status report not requested
  1     Request a status report
  ----- -----------------------------

#### 9.2.2.5 Extension bit (E)

Length: 1bit.

The interpretation of this bit depends on RLC mode and higher layer
configuration:

\- In the UMD PDU, the \"Extension bit\" in the first octet has either
the normal E-bit interpretation or the alternative E-bit interpretation
depending on higher layer configuration. The \"Extension bit\" in all
the other octets always has the normal E-bit interpretation.

\- In the AMD PDU, the \"Extension bit\" always has the normal E-bit
interpretation.

**Normal E-bit interpretation:**

  ----- -----------------------------------------------------------
  Bit   Description
  0     The next field is data, piggybacked STATUS PDU or padding
  1     The next field is Length Indicator and E bit
  ----- -----------------------------------------------------------

Alternative E-bit interpretation:

  --------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Bit**   **Description**
  **0**     The next field is a complete SDU, which is not segmented, concatenated or padded.
  **1**     The next field is Length Indicator and E bit
  --------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### 9.2.2.6 Reserved 1 (R1)

Length: 3 bits.

This field in the RESET PDU and RESET ACK PDU is used to have a multiple
of 8 bits in length. Its shall always be coded to \"000\". Other values
are reserved and will be considered invalid for this version of the
protocol.

#### 9.2.2.7 Header Extension Type (HE)

Length: 2 bits.

This two-bit field indicates if the next octet is data or a \"Length
Indicator\" and E bit.

  ------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Value   Description
  00      The succeeding octet contains data
  01      The succeeding octet contains a length indicator and E bit
  10      This value is the special value of HE field and indicates that the succeeding octet contains data and the last octet of the PDU is the last octet of an SDU.
  11      Reserved (PDUs with this coding will be discarded by this version of the protocol).
  ------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### 9.2.2.8 Length Indicator (LI)

Unless the \"Extension bit\" indicates that a UMD PDU contains a
complete SDU which is not segmented, concatenated or padded, or the HE
field indicates that an AMD PDU contains the last octet of the RLC SDU,
a \"Length Indicator\" is used to indicate the last octet of each RLC
SDU ending within the PDU. If the \"Extension bit\" indicates that the
UMD PDU contains a complete SDU which is not segmented, concatenated or
padded, or the HE field indicates that an AMD PDU contains the last
octet of the SDU, no LIs are present in this RLC PDU.

Except for the predefined values reserved for special purposes and
listed in the tables below, the \"Length Indicator\" shall:

\- be set to the number of octets between the end of the RLC header and
up to and including the last octet of an RLC SDU segment;

\- be included in the PDUs that they refer to.

The size of the \"Length Indicator\" may be either 7 bits or 15 bits.
The \"Length Indicator\" size is determined independently for uplink and
downlink. The value of a \"Length Indicator\" shall not exceed the
values specified in subclauses 11.2.4.2 and 11.3.4.5 respectively for
UMD and AMD PDUs.

The \"Length Indicators\" which refer to the same PDU shall:

\- not be reordered in case of retransmission;

\- be in the same order as the RLC SDUs that they refer to.

For AM uplink and for AM downlink when \"Fixed RLC PDU size\" is
configured:

\- if the \"AMD PDU size\" is ≤ 126 octets:

\- 7-bit \"Length Indicators\" shall be used.

\- else:

\- 15-bit \"Length Indicators\" shall be used.

\- the size of the \"Length Indicator\" is always the same for all AMD
PDUs, for one RLC entity.

For AM downlink and AM uplink when \"Flexible RLC PDU size\" is
configured:

\- if \"Length Indicator size\" is set to 7 bits:

\- 7-bit \"Length Indicators\" shall be used.

\- else:

\- 15-bit \"Length Indicators\" shall be used.

For UM uplink:

\- if the \"largest UL UMD PDU size\" is ≤ 125 octets:

\- 7-bit \"Length Indicators\" shall be used.

\- else:

\- 15-bit \"Length Indicators\" shall be used.

For UM downlink:

\- the \"Length Indicator\" size provided in \"DL RLC UM LI size\" shall
be used.

For UM:

\- between modifications of the \"largest UMD PDU size\", the size of
the \"Length Indicator\" is the same for all UMD PDUs;

\- if the RLC SDU begins in the beginning of the RLC PDU; and

\- if the RLC PDU is transmitted in uplink; and

\- if the \"Length Indicators\" indicating that a RLC SDU ended exactly
in the end or one octet short (only when 15-bit \"Length Indicators\" is
used) of the previous RLC PDU are not present; and

\- if the \"Extension bit\" does not indicate that the UMD PDU contains
a complete SDU which is not segmented, concatenated or padded; and

\- if the \"Length Indicator\" indicating that the first data octet in
this RLC PDU is the first octet of an RLC SDU and the last octet in this
RLC PDU is the last octet of the same RLC SDU is not present; and

\- if the \"Length Indicator\" indicating that the first data octet in
this RLC PDU is the first octet of an SDU and the same RLC SDU is one
octet short of exactly filling the PDU (only when 15-bit \"Length
Indicators\" is used) is not present:

\- if 7-bit \"Length Indicator\" is used:

\- the \"Length Indicator\" with value \"111 1100\" shall be used.

\- if 15-bit \"Length Indicator\" is used:

\- the \"Length Indicator\" with value \"111 1111 1111 1100\" shall be
used.

\- in downlink:

\- if 7-bit \"Length Indicator\" is used:

\- the Receiver shall be prepared to receive the \"Length Indicator\"
with value \"111 1100\";

\- the Receiver shall follow the discard rules in subclause 11.2.3 both
when the \"Length Indicator\" with value \"111 1100\" is present and
when it is absent.

\- if 15-bit \"Length Indicator\" is used:

\- the Receiver shall be prepared to receive the \"Length Indicator\"
with value \"111 1111 1111 1100\";

\- the Receiver shall follow the discard rules in subclause 11.2.3 both
when the \"Length Indicator\" with value \"111 1111 1111 1100\" is
present and when it is absent.

In the case where the end of the last segment of an RLC SDU exactly ends
at the end of a PDU and there is no \"Length Indicator\" that indicates
the end of the RLC SDU, and the HE field of the PDU does not indicate
that the last octet of the AMD PDU is the last octet of an SDU, and the
\"Extension bit\" of the following PDU does not indicate that the UMD
PDU contains a complete SDU which is not segmented, concatenated or
padded, and the \"Length Indicator\" of the following PDU does not
indicate that the first data octet in that PDU is the first octet of an
SDU and the last octet in that PDU is the last octet of the same SDU,
and the \"Length Indicator\" of the following PDU does not indicate that
the first data octet in that RLC PDU is the first octet of an SDU and
the same RLC SDU is one octet short of exactly filling the PDU (only
when 15-bit \"Length Indicators\" is used):

\- if 7-bit \"Length Indicator\" is used:

\- a \"Length Indicator\" with value \"000 0000\" shall be placed as the
first \"Length Indicator\" in the following PDU;

\- if 15-bit \"Length Indicator\" is used:

\- a \"Length Indicator\" with value \"000 0000 0000 0000\" shall be
placed as the first \"Length Indicator\" in the following PDU.

In the case where a PDU contains a 15-bit \"Length Indicator\"
indicating that an RLC SDU ends with one octet left in the PDU, the last
octet of this PDU shall:

\- be padded by the Sender and ignored by the Receiver though there is
no \"Length Indicator\" indicating the existence of Padding; and

\- not be filled with the first octet of the next RLC SDU data.

In the case where 15-bit \"Length Indicators\" are used in a PDU and the
last segment of an RLC SDU is one octet short of exactly filling the PDU
and there is no \"Length Indicator\" that indicates the end of the RLC
SDU:

\- if a 15-bit \"Length Indicator\" is used for the following PDU:

\- the \"Length Indicator\" with value \"111 1111 1111 1011\" shall be
placed as the first \"Length Indicator\" in the following PDU;

\- the remaining one octet in the current PDU shall be padded by the
Sender and ignored at the Receiver though there is no \"Length
Indicator\" indicating the existence of Padding;

\- if a 7-bit \"Length Indicator\" size is configured for the following
PDU:

\- if RLC is configured for UM mode:

\- if the \"Extension bit\" of that PDU does not indicate that the UMD
PDU contains a complete SDU which is not segmented, concatenated or
padded, and the \"Length Indicator\" of that PDU does not indicate that
the first data octet in that PDU is the first octet of an SDU and the
last octet in that PDU is the last octet of the same SDU:

\- the \"Length Indicator\" with value \"000 0000\" shall be placed as
the first \"Length indicator\" in the following PDU;

\- the \"Sequence Number\" shall be incremented by 2 before it is
transmitted.

For UM and AM RLC:

\- if a 7 bit \"Length Indicator\" is used in a RLC PDU and one or more
padding octets are present in the RLC PDU after the end of the last RLC
SDU:

\- indicate the presence of padding by including a \"Length Indicator\"
with value \"1111111\" as the last \"Length Indicator\" in the PDU.

\- if a 15 bit \"Length Indicator\" is used in a RLC PDU and two or more
padding octets are present in the RLC PDU after the end of the last RLC
SDU:

\- indicate the presence of padding by including a \"Length Indicator\"
with value \"111 1111 1111 1111\" as the last \"Length Indicator\" in
the PDU.

NOTE: After the \"Length Indicator\" indicating the presence of padding
has been included in the RLC PDU, the length of the padding may be zero.

In the case where the \"alternative E-bit interpretation\" is configured
for UM RLC and an RLC PDU contains a segment of an SDU but neither the
first octet nor the last octet of this SDU:

\- if a 7-bit \"Length Indicator\" is used:

\- the \"Length Indicator\" with value \"111 1110\" shall be used.

\- if a 15-bit \"Length Indicator\" is used:

\- the \"Length Indicator\" with value \"111 1111 1111 1110\" shall be
used.

In the case where the \"alternative E-bit interpretation\" is configured
for UM RLC and the first data octet in this RLC PDU is the first octet
of an SDU and the last octet in this RLC PDU is the last octet of the
same SDU:

\- if a 7-bit \"Length Indicator\" is used:

\- the \"Length Indicator\" with value \"111 1101\" shall be used.

\- if a 15-bit \"Length Indicator\" is used:

\- the \"Length Indicator\" with value \"111 1111 1111 1101\" shall be
used.

In the case where the \"alternative E-bit interpretation\" is configured
for UM RLC and the first data octet in this RLC PDU is the first octet
of an SDU and the same RLC SDU is one octet short of exactly filling the
PDU and a 15-bit \"Length Indicator\" is used:

\- the \"Length Indicator\" with value \"111 1111 1111 1010\" shall be
used.

If a \"Length Indicator\" is still awaiting transmission and there is no
RLC SDU available, an RLC PDU consisting of this \"Length Indicator\",
the appropriate padding \"Length Indicator\" and padding may be
transmitted.

Predefined values of the \"Length Indicator\" are used to indicate
padding. The values that are reserved for special purposes are listed in
the tables below depending on the size of the \"Length Indicator\". Only
predefined \"Length Indicator\" values can refer to the padding space.
These values shall only be placed after all other \"Length Indicators\"
for a PDU.

STATUS PDUs can be piggybacked on the AMD PDU by using part or all of
the padding space. A predefined \"Length Indicator\" shall be used to
indicate the presence of a piggybacked STATUS PDU. This \"Length
Indicator\" replaces the padding \"Length Indicator\". The piggybacked
STATUS PDU shall be appended immediately following the PDU data. When
only part of the padding space is used, the end of the piggybacked
STATUS PDU is indicated by one of the SUFI fields NO\_MORE or ACK. Thus
no additional \"Length Indicator\" is required to show that there is
still padding in the AMD PDU.

If \"SDU discard with explicit signalling\" is configured:

\- an AMD PDU can contain a maximum number of 15 \"Length Indicators\"
indicating the end of 15 corresponding SDUs; and

\- the rest of the AMD PDU space shall be used as padding or as
piggybacked STATUS PDU.

#### 9.2.2.9 Data field

RLC SDUs or segments of RLC SDUs are mapped to this field in
transparent, unacknowledged and acknowledged modes.

Transparent mode data:

\- the length of RLC SDUs is not constrained to a multiple of 8 bits;

\- if \"Segmentation\" is configured:

\- all the RLC PDUs carrying segments of a RLC SDU shall be sent in one
TTI;

\- only RLC PDUs carrying segments from a single RLC SDU shall be sent
in one TTI;

\- otherwise (Segmentation is not configured):

\- TMD PDU size is fixed within a single TTI and is equal to the RLC SDU
size.

Unacknowledged mode data and Acknowledged mode data:

\- the length of RLC SDUs is constrained to a multiple of 8 bits;

\- if \"Fixed RLC PDU size\" is configured:

\- the last segment of an RLC SDU shall be concatenated with the first
segment of the next RLC SDU in order to fill the data field completely
and avoid unnecessary padding unless otherwise specified in subclause
9.2.2.8 or subclause 11.2.2.2. The \"Length Indicator\" field is used to
point the borders between RLC SDUs (see subclause 9.2.2.8).

\- if \"Flexible RLC PDU size\" is configured:

\- in downlink, the last segment of an RLC SDU may be concatenated with
the first segment of the next RLC SDU in order to fill the data field up
to a maximum RLC PDU size. The \"Length Indicator\" field is used to
point the borders between RLC SDUs (see subclause 9.2.2.8).

\- in uplink, the last segment of an RLC SDU shall be concatenated with
the first segment of the next RLC SDU in order to fill the data field at
least up to the Minimum UL RLC PDU size. It is allowed to concatenate up
to the largest UL AMD PDU size for Acknowledged mode data and largest
UMD PDU size for Unacknowledged mode data. The \"Length Indicator\"
field is used to point the borders between RLC SDUs (see subclause
9.2.2.8). If data to be transmitted is not enough to create a UMD PDU of
the minimum size, it is allowed to create a UMD PDU including all data
to be transmitted, even if the resulting size is smaller than the
Minimum UL RLC PDU size.

\- in uplink, if MAC-i/is has been configured:

\- if the UE pre-generates RLC PDUs for transmission in a later TTI and
there is only one activated uplink frequency:

\- provided that the UE has sufficient amount of data available for
transmission, the size of the data field of the RLC PDU shall be chosen
so that each RLC PDU to be multiplexed to the MAC-i/is PDU matches the
maximum amount of data allowed to be transmitted by the applicable
current grant (scheduled or non-scheduled) for the current TTI.

\- RLC PDUs may only be pre-generated if the amount of data in
outstanding pre-generated RLC PDUs for this logical channel is less than
or equal to four times the maximum amount of data allowed to be
transmitted by the applicable current grant (scheduled or non-scheduled)
for the current TTI.

\- else if the UE pre-generates RLC PDUs for transmission in a later TTI
and there are two activated uplink frequencies for FDD or more than one
scheduled uplink frequencies for 1.28 Mcps TDD:

\- provided that the UE has sufficient amount of data available for
transmission, the size of the data field of the RLC PDU shall be chosen
so that each RLC PDU to be multiplexed to the MAC-i/is PDU matches the
minimum of the following:

\- For FDD,

\- maximum amount of data allowed to be transmitted by the applicable
current grant (scheduled or non-scheduled) on the primary uplink
frequency for the current TTI.

\- maximum amount of data allowed to be transmitted by the applicable
current grant (scheduled) on the secondary uplink frequency for the
current TTI.

\- For 1.28 Mcps TDD,

\- maximum amount of data allowed to be transmitted by the applicable
current grant (scheduled) on the each scheduled uplink frequency for the
current TTI.

\- For FDD, RLC PDUs may only be pre-generated if the amount of data in
outstanding pre-generated RLC PDUs for this logical channel is less than
or equal to eight times the minimum of the following:

\- maximum amount of data allowed to be transmitted by the applicable
current grant (scheduled or non-scheduled) on the primary uplink
frequency for the current TTI.

\- maximum amount of data allowed to be transmitted by the applicable
current grant (scheduled) on the secondary uplink frequency for the
current TTI.

\- For 1.28 Mcps TDD, RLC PDUs may only be pre-generated if the amount
of data in outstanding pre-generated RLC PDUs for this logical channel
is less than or equal to 4N times the minimum of the following:

\- maximum amount of data allowed to be transmitted by the applicable
current grant (scheduled) of each uplink frequency for the current TTI.

NOTE: N is the number of configured uplink frequencies.

\- else:

\- the size of the data field of the RLC PDU shall be chosen so that the
RLC PDU size matches the data requested for this logical channel by the
current E-TFC selection.

\- if \"Flexible RLC PDU size\" is configured, the maximum size of the
data field of the RLC PDU is 1503 octets.

#### 9.2.2.10 Padding (PAD)

All unused space in a PDU shall be located at the end of the PDU and is
referred to as padding. Padding shall have a length such that the PDU as
a whole has one of the predefined total lengths.

Padding may have any value and the Receiver and the Sender shall
disregard it.

#### 9.2.2.11 SUFI

Which SUFI fields to use is implementation dependent, but when a STATUS
PDU includes information about which AMD PDUs have been received and
which are detected as missing, information shall not be included about
AMD PDUs with \"Sequence Number\"≥VR(H) or \"Sequence Number\"≥VR(MR),
i.e. AMD PDUs that have not yet reached the Receiver or are above the
receiving window. Information about AMD PDUs with \"Sequence
Number\"\<VR(R) shall not be given except when this is necessary in
order to use the BITMAP SUFI, see subclause 9.2.2.11.5.

Length: variable number of bits.

The SUFI can include three sub-fields: type information (type of
super-field, e.g. list, bitmap, acknowledgement, etc), length
information (providing the length of a variable length field within the
following value field) and a value.

Figure 9.7 shows the structure of the super-field. The size of the type
sub‑field is non-zero but the size of the other sub‑fields may be zero.

  --------
  Type
  Length
  Value
  --------

Figure 9.7: The Structure of a Super-Field

The length of the type field is 4 bits and it may have any of following
values.

  ----------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Bit         Description
  0000        No More Data (**NO**\_**MORE**)
  0001        Window Size (**WINDOW**)
  0010        Acknowledgement (**ACK**)
  0011        List (**LIST**)
  0100        Bitmap (**BITMAP**)

  0111        Move Receiving Window Acknowledgement **(MRW\_ACK)**
  1000        Poll (**POLL**)
  1001-1111   Reserved (PDUs with this encoding are invalid for this version of the protocol)
  ----------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The size and presence of the sub-fields \"Length\" and \"Value\" depend
on the super-field type and is specified for each super field
separately.

##### 9.2.2.11.1 The No More Data super-field

The \'No More Data\' super-field indicates the end of the data part of a
STATUS PDU and is shown in Figure 9.8 below. It shall always be placed
as the last SUFI if it is included in a STATUS PDU. All data after this
SUFI shall be regarded as padding and shall be neglected.

  -------------------
  Type=**NO\_MORE**
  -------------------

Figure 9.8: NO\_MORE field in a STATUS PDU

##### 9.2.2.11.2 The Acknowledgement super-field

The \'Acknowledgement\' super-field consists of a type identifier field
(ACK) and a sequence number (LSN) as shown in figure 9.9 below. The
acknowledgement super-field is also indicating the end of the data part
of a STATUS PDU. Thus, no \'NO\_MORE\' super-field is needed in the
STATUS PDU when the \'ACK\' super-field is present. The ACK SUFI shall
always be placed as the last SUFI if it is included in a STATUS PDU. All
data after this SUFI shall be regarded as padding and shall be
neglected.

  ----------------
  Type = **ACK**
  LSN
  ----------------

Figure 9.9: The ACK fields in a STATUS PDU

**LSN**

Length: 12 bits

Acknowledges the reception of all AMD PDUs with \"Sequence Number\" \<
LSN (Last Sequence Number) that are *not* indicated to be erroneous in
earlier parts of the STATUS PDU. This means that if the LSN is set to a
value greater than VR(R), all erroneous AMD PDUs shall be included in
the same STATUS PDU and if the LSN is set to VR(R), the erroneous AMD
PDUs can be split into several STATUS PDUs. At the transmitter, if the
value of the LSN =\< the value of the first error indicated in the
STATUS PDU, VT(A) will be updated according to the LSN, otherwise VT(A)
will be updated according to the first error indicated in the STATUS
PDU. VT(A) is only updated based on STATUS PDUs where ACK SUFI (or
MRW\_ACK SUFI) is included. The LSN shall not be set to a value \> VR(H)
nor \< VR(R).

##### 9.2.2.11.3 The Window Size super-field

The Window Size super-field consists of a type identifier (WINDOW) and a
window size number (WSN) as shown in Figure 9.10 below. The Receiver is
always allowed to change the transmission window size of the peer entity
during a connection, but the minimum and the maximum allowed value is
given by upper layers configuration. The reception window size of the
Receiver is not changed.

  -------------------
  Type = **WINDOW**
  WSN
  -------------------

Figure 9.10: The WINDOW fields in a STATUS PDU

**WSN**

Length: 12 bits

The value of VT(WS) to be used by the transmitter. The range of the WSN
is \[0, 2^12^-1\]. The minimum value of VT(WS) is 1. If WSN is zero the
SUFI shall be discarded by this version of the protocol. The variable
VT(WS) is set equal to WSN upon reception of this SUFI. If WSN is
greater than Configured\_Tx\_Window\_Size, VT(WS) shall be set equal to
Configured\_Tx\_Window\_Size.

##### 9.2.2.11.4 The List super-field

The List Super-Field consists of a type identifier field (LIST), a list
length field (LENGTH) and a list of LENGTH number of pairs as shown in
figure 9.11 below:

  -----------------
  Type = **LIST**
  LENGTH
  SN~1~
  L~1~
  SN~2~
  L~2~
  ...
  SN~LENGTH~
  L~LENGTH~
  -----------------

Figure 9.11: The List fields in a STATUS PDU

**LENGTH**

Length: 4 bits

The number of (SN*~i~* , L*~i~*)-pairs in the super-field of type LIST.
The value \"0000\" is invalid and the STATUS PDU is discarded.

**SN*~i~***

Length: 12 bits

\"Sequence Number\" of AMD PDU, which was not correctly received.

**L*~i~***

Length: 4 bits

Number of consecutive AMD PDUs not correctly received following AMD PDU
with \"Sequence Number\" SN*~i~*.

##### 9.2.2.11.5 The Bitmap super-field

The Bitmap Super-Field consists of a type identifier field (BITMAP), a
bitmap length field (LENGTH), a first sequence number (FSN) and a bitmap
as shown in figure 9.12 below:

  -------------------
  Type = **BITMAP**
  LENGTH
  FSN
  Bitmap
  -------------------

Figure 9.12: The Bitmap fields in a STATUS PDU

**LENGTH**

Length: 4 bits

The size of the bitmap in octets equals LENGTH+1, i.e. LENGTH=\"0000\"
means that the size of the bitmap is one octet and LENGTH=\"1111\" gives
the maximum bitmap size of 16 octets.

**FSN**

Length: 12 bits

The \"Sequence Number\" for the first bit in the bitmap. FSN shall not
be set to a value lower than VR(R)-7 when the reception window size is
less than half the maximum RLC AM \"Sequence Number\". If the reception
window size is larger, FSN shall not be set to a value lower than VR(R).

**Bitmap**

Length: Variable number of octets given by the LENGTH field.

Status of the \"Sequence Number\" fields in the interval \[FSN, FSN +
(LENGTH+1)\*8 - 1\] indicated in the bitmap where each position (from
left to right) can have two different values (0 and 1) with the
following meaning (bit\_position∈\[0,(LENGTH+1)\*8 ‑ 1\]):

1: Sequence Number = (FSN + bit\_position) has been correctly received.

0: Sequence Number = (FSN + bit\_position) has not been correctly
received.

The UE may remove AMD PDUs from the transmitter that have been indicated
to be correctly received by a BITMAP SUFI.

NOTE: The transmission window is not advanced based on BITMAP SUFIs, see
subclause 9.4.

##### 9.2.2.11.6 The Relative List super-field

The Relative List super-field consists of a type identifier field
(RLIST), a list length field (LENGTH), the first sequence number (FSN)
and a list of LENGTH number of codewords (CW) as shown in figure 9.13
below.

  ------------------
  Type = **RLIST**
  LENGTH
  FSN
  CW~1~
  CW~2~
  ...
  CW~LENGTH~
  ------------------

Figure 9.13: The RList fields in a STATUS PDU

**LENGTH**

Length: 4 bits

The number of codewords (CW) in the super-field of type RLIST.

**FSN**

Length: 12 bits

The \"Sequence Number\" for the first erroneous AMD PDU in the RLIST,
i.e. LENGTH=\"0000\" means that only FSN is present in the SUFI.

**CW**

Length: 4 bits

The CW consists of 4 bits where the three first bits are part of a
number and the last bit is a status indicator and it shall be
interpreted as follows:

  ---------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Code Word        Description
  X~1~X~2~X~3~ 0   Next 3 bits of the number are X~1~X~2~X~3~ and the number continues in the next CW. The most significant bit within this CW is X**~1~**.
  X~1~X~2~X~3~ 1   Next 3 bits of the number are X~1~X~2~X~3~ and the number is terminated. The most significant bit within this CW is X**~1~**. This is the most significant CW within the number.
  ---------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

By default, the number given by the CWs represents a distance between
the previous indicated erroneous AMD PDU up to and including the next
erroneous AMD PDU.

One special value of CW is defined:

**000 1** \'Error burst indicator\'.

The error burst indicator means that the next CWs will represent the
number of subsequent erroneous AMD PDUs (not counting the already
indicated error position). After the number of errors in a burst is
terminated with XXX 1, the next codeword will again by default be the
least significant bits (LSB) of the distance to the next error.

If the last CW, as indicated by the value of the LENGTH field, does not
contain a \"1\" in its rightmost position, or the last CW, as indicated
by the value of the LENGTH field does contain a \"1\" in its rightmost
position, but is a special \"error burst indicator\" CW, the encoding of
the RLIST SUFI is invalid, and the STATUS PDU is discarded.

##### 9.2.2.11.7 The Move Receiving Window Acknowledgement super-field

The \'Move Receiving Window Acknowledgement\' super-field acknowledges
the reception of a MRW SUFI. The format is given in figure 9.14 below.

  ---------------------
  Type = **MRW\_ACK**
  N
  SN\_ACK
  ---------------------

Figure 9.14: The MRW-ACK fields in a STATUS PDU

**N**

Length: 4 bits

The N field shall be set equal to the N~LENGTH~ field in the received
MRW SUFI if the SN\_ACK field is equal to the SN\_MRW~LENGTH~ field.
Otherwise N shall be set to 0.

With the aid of this field in combination with the SN\_ACK field, it can
be determined if the MRW\_ACK corresponds to a previously transmitted
MRW SUFI.

**SN\_ACK**

Length: 12 bits

The SN\_ACK field indicates the updated value of VR(R) after the
reception of the MRW SUFI. With the aid of this field in combination
with the N field, it can be determined if the MRW\_ACK corresponds to a
previously transmitted MRW SUFI.

##### 9.2.2.11.8 The Move Receiving Window (MRW) super-field

The \'Move Receiving Window\' super-field is used to request the
Receiver to move its reception window and optionally to indicate the set
of discarded RLC SDUs, as a result of an RLC SDU discard in the Sender.
The format is given in figure 9.15 below.

  -----------------
  Type = **MRW**
  LENGTH
  SN\_MRW~1~
  SN\_MRW~2~
  \...
  SN\_MRW~LENGTH~
  N~LENGTH~
  -----------------

Figure 9.15: The MRW fields in a STATUS PDU

**LENGTH**

Length: 4 bits

The number of SN\_MRW~i~ fields in the super-field of type MRW.

The values \"0001\" through \"1111\" indicate 1 through 15 SN\_MRW~i~
respectively. The value \"0000\" indicates that one SN\_MRW~i~ field is
present and that the RLC SDU to be discarded in the Receiver extends
above the configured transmission window in the Sender.

**SN\_MRW~i~**

Length: 12 bits

When \"Send MRW\" is configured, an SN\_MRW~i~ shall be used to indicate
the end of each discarded RLC SDU, i.e. the number of SN\_MRW~i~ fields
shall equal the number of RLC SDUs discarded by that MRW SUFI. When
\"Send MRW\" is not configured, an SN\_MRW~i~ field shall be used to
indicate the end of the last RLC SDU to be discarded in the Receiver and
additional ones may optionally be used to indicate the end of other
discarded RLC SDUs. SN\_MRW~i~ is the \"Sequence Number\" of the AMD PDU
that contains the \"Length Indicator\" or the special value of the HE
field of the i:th RLC SDU to be discarded in the Receiver (except for
SN\_MRW~LENGTH~ when N~LENGTH~ = 0, see definition of N~LENGTH~). The
order of the SN\_MRW~i~ shall be in the same sequential order as the RLC
SDUs that they refer to.

Additionally SN\_MRW~LENGTH~ requests the Receiver to discard all not
yet successfully received SDUs that have segments or \"Length
Indicators\" indicating the end of the SDUs in the AMD PDUs with
\"Sequence Number\" \< SN\_MRW~LENGTH~, and to move the reception window
accordingly. In addition, when N~LENGTH~ \> 0, the Receiver has to
discard the not yet successfully received SDUs that have segments or
\"Length Indicators\" indicating the end of the SDUs in the AMD PDU with
sequence number SN\_MRW~LENGTH~ up to and including the octet indicated
by the N~LENGTH~:th \"Length Indicator\" field of the PDU with sequence
number SN\_MRW~LENGTH~.

**N~LENGTH~**

Length: 4 bits

N~LENGTH~ is used together with SN\_MRW~LENGTH~ to indicate the end of
the last RLC SDU to be discarded in the Receiver.

N~LENGTH~ indicates which \"Length Indicator\" in the AMD PDU with
\"Sequence Number\" SN\_MRW~LENGTH~ corresponds to the last RLC SDU to
be discarded in the Receiver. N~LENGTH~ = 0 indicates that the end of
the last RLC SDU was indicated in the AMD PDU with \"Sequence Number\"
SN\_MRW~LENGTH~ --1 and that the first data octet in the AMD PDU with
\"Sequence Number\" SN\_MRW~LENGTH~ is the first data octet to be
reassembled next.

##### 9.2.2.11.9 The Poll (POLL) super-field

The \'Poll\' super-field is used to request a status report (one or
several STATUS PDUs) from the receiver. The poll super-field in downlink
can only be used if flexible RLC PDU size is configured in the downlink.
The poll super-field in uplink can only be used if flexible RLC PDU size
is configured in the uplink. The format is given in figure 9.15b below.

  -----------------
  Type = **POLL**
  Poll\_SN
  -----------------

Figure 9.15b: The POLL fields in a STATUS PDU

**Poll\_SN**

Length: 12 bits

When \"Poll\" is configured, the Poll\_SN field shall be set to VT(S)-1.

#### 9.2.2.12 Reserved 2 (R2)

Length: 1 bit

This bit in the Piggybacked STATUS PDU is used to make the Piggybacked
STATUS PDU a multiple of 8 bits in length and for this purpose it is
coded as 0. Otherwise the PDU is treated as invalid and hence shall be
discarded by this version of the protocol.

#### 9.2.2.13 Reset Sequence Number (RSN)

Length: 1 bit

This field is used to indicate the sequence number of the transmitted
RESET PDU. If this RESET PDU is a retransmission of the original RESET
PDU then the retransmitted RESET PDU would have the same RSN value as
the original RESET PDU. Otherwise it will have the next RSN value. The
initial value of this field is zero. The value of this field shall be
reinitialised when the RLC is re-established. It shall not be
reinitialised when the RLC is reset.

#### 9.2.2.14 Hyper Frame Number Indicator (HFNI)

Length: 20 bit

This field is used to indicate the hyper frame number (HFN) to the peer
entity. With the aid of this field the HFN in UE and UTRAN can be
synchronised.

9.4 State variables
-------------------

The state variables defined in this subclause are normative.

This sub-clause describes the state variables used in AM and UM in order
to specify the peer-to-peer protocol. All state variables are
non-negative integers. UMD and AMD PDUs are numbered by modulo integer
sequence numbers (SN) cycling through the field: 0 to 212 -- 1 for AM
and 0 to 2^7^ -- 1 for UM. All arithmetic operations contained in the
present document on VT(S), VT(A), VT(MS), VR(R), VR(H) and VR(MR) are
affected by the AM modulus. All arithmetic operations contained in the
present document on VT(US), VR(US), VR(UDH), VR(UDR), VR(UOH) and VR(UM)
are affected by the UM modulus. When performing arithmetic comparisons
of state variables or Sequence number values a modulus base shall be
used. This modulus base is subtracted (within the appropriate field)
from all the values involved and then an absolute comparison is
performed. At the Sender, VT(A) and VT(US) shall be assumed to be the
modulus base in AM and UM respectively. At the Receiver, VR(R) shall be
assumed to be the modulus base in AM and VR(US) shall be assumed to be
the modulus base in UM when neither the \"out of sequence SDU delivery\"
nor the \"duplicate avoidance and reordering\" function are configured.
When \"out of sequence SDU delivery\" is configured, (VR(UOH) --
OSD\_Window\_Size + 1) shall be assumed to be the modulus base at the
Receiver in UM; when the \"duplicate avoidance and reordering\" function
is configured, (VR(UDH) -- DAR\_Window\_Size + 1) shall be assumed to be
the modulus base at the Receiver in UM.

The RLC shall maintain the following state variables in the Sender.

a\) VT(S) - Send state variable.

This state variable contains the \"Sequence Number\" of the next AMD PDU
to be transmitted for the first time (i.e. excluding retransmitted
PDUs). It shall be updated after the aforementioned AMD PDU is
transmitted or after transmission of a MRW SUFI which includes
SN\_MRW~LENGTH~ \>VT(S) (see subclause 11.6).

> The initial value of this variable is 0.

b\) VT(A) - Acknowledge state variable.

This state variable contains the \"Sequence Number\" following the
\"Sequence Number\" of the last in-sequence acknowledged AMD PDU. This
forms the lower edge of the transmission window of acceptable
acknowledgements. VT(A) shall be updated based on the receipt of a
STATUS PDU including an ACK (see subclause 9.2.2.11.2) and/or an
MRW\_ACK SUFI (see subclause 11.6).

The initial value of this variable is 0. For the purpose of initialising
the protocol, this value shall be assumed to be the first \"Sequence
Number\" following the last in-sequence acknowledged AMD PDU.

c\) VT(DAT).

This state variable counts the number of times a AMD PDU has been
scheduled to be transmitted. There shall be one VT(DAT) for each PDU and
each shall be incremented every time the corresponding AMD PDU is
scheduled to be transmitted or every time a STATUS PDU containing the
POLL SUFI is scheduled to be transmitted and the sequence number of the
corresponding AMD PDU is equal to VT(S)-1.

The initial value of this variable is 0.

d\) VT(MS) - Maximum Send state variable.

This state variable contains the \"Sequence Number\" of the first AMD
PDU that can be rejected by the peer Receiver, VT(MS) = VT(A) + VT(WS).
This value represents the upper edge of the transmission window. The
transmitter shall not transmit AMD PDUs with \"Sequence Number\" ≥
VT(MS) unless VT(S) ≥ VT(MS). In that case, the AMD PDU with \"Sequence
Number\" = VT(S) - 1 can also be transmitted. VT(MS) shall be updated
when VT(A) or VT(WS) is updated.

The initial value of this variable is Configured\_Tx\_Window\_size.

e\) VT(US) -- UM data state variable.

This state variable contains the \"Sequence Number\" of the next UMD PDU
to be transmitted. It shall be incremented by 1 each time a UMD PDU is
transmitted.

The initial value of this variable is 0.

NOTE: For the UTRAN side, the initial value of this variable can be
different from 0.

f\) VT(PDU).

This state variable is used when the \"poll every Poll\_PDU PDU\"
polling trigger is configured. It shall be incremented by 1 for each AMD
PDU that is transmitted including both new and retransmitted AMD PDUs.
When it becomes equal to the value Poll\_PDU, a new poll shall be
transmitted and the state variable shall be set to zero.

The initial value of this variable is 0.

g\) VT(SDU).

This state variable is used when the \"poll every Poll\_SDU SDU\"
polling trigger is configured. It shall be incremented by 1 for a given
SDU when the AMD PDU carrying the first segment of this SDU is scheduled
to be transmitted for the first time. When it becomes equal to the value
Poll\_SDU a new poll shall be transmitted and the state variable shall
be set to zero. The \"Polling bit\" shall be set to \"1\" in the first
transmission of the AMD PDU that contains the last segment of an RLC SDU
(indicated either by the \"Length Indicator\" indicating the end of the
SDU or by the special value of the HE field).

The initial value of this variable is 0.

h\) VT(RST) - Reset state variable.

This state variable is used to count the number of times a RESET PDU is
scheduled to be transmitted before the reset procedure is completed.
VT(RST) shall be incremented by 1 according to subclauses 11.4.2 and
11.4.5.1. VT(RST) shall only be reset upon the reception of a RESET ACK
PDU ( i.e. VT(RST) shall not be reset when an RLC reset initiated by the
peer RLC entity occurs) unless otherwise specified in subclause 9.7.7.

The initial value of this variable is 0.

i\) VT(MRW) -- MRW command send state variable.

This state variable is used to count the number of times a MRW command
is transmitted. VT(MRW) is incremented by 1 each time a timer Timer\_MRW
expires. VT(MRW) shall be reset when the SDU discard with explicit
signalling procedure is terminated.

> The initial value of this variable is 0.
>
> j\) VT(WS) -- Transmission window size state variable.

This state variable contains the size that shall be used for the
transmission window. VT(WS) shall be set equal to the WSN field when the
transmitter receives a STATUS PDU including a WINDOW SUFI.

The initial value of this variable is Configured\_Tx\_Window\_size.

The RLC shall maintain the following state variables in the Receiver:

a\) VR(R) - Receive state variable.

This state variable contains the \"Sequence Number\" following that of
the last in-sequence AMD PDU received. It shall be updated upon the
receipt of the AMD PDU with \"Sequence Number\" equal to VR(R).

The initial value of this variable is 0. For the purpose of initialising
the protocol, this value shall be assumed to be the first \"Sequence
Number\" following the last in-sequence received AMD PDU.

b\) VR(H) - Highest expected state variable.

This state variable contains the \"Sequence Number\" following the
highest \"Sequence Number\" of any AMD PDU received or identified to be
missing.. When a AMD PDU is received with \"Sequence Number\" x or a
POLL SUFI is received with POLL\_SN=x such that VR(H)≤x\<VR(MR), this
state variable shall be set equal to x+1.

The initial value of this variable is 0.

c\) VR(MR) - Maximum acceptable Receive state variable.

This state variable contains the \"Sequence Number\" of the first AMD
PDU that shall be rejected by the Receiver, VR(MR) = VR(R) +
Configured\_Rx\_Window\_Size.

d\) VR(US) - Receiver Send Sequence state variable.

This state variable is applicable only when \"out of sequence SDU
delivery\" is not configured. This state variable contains the
\"Sequence Number\" following that of the last UMD PDU received by the
reception buffer (see Fig. 4.3 and 4.3a). When a UMD PDU with \"Sequence
Number\" equal to x is received by the reception buffer, the state
variable shall set equal to x + 1.

The initial value of this variable is 0.

e\) VR(UOH) --UM out of sequence SDU delivery highest received state
variable.

> This state variable contains the \"Sequence Number\" of the highest

9.5 Timers
----------

The timers defined in this subclause are normative. The timers shall be
considered active from the time they are started until the time they
either expire or are stopped.

a\) Timer\_Poll.

This timer shall only be used when so configured by upper layers. The
value of the timer is signalled by upper layers. In the UE this timer
shall be started (or restarted) when the successful or unsuccessful
transmission of a poll is indicated by lower layer. In UTRAN it should
be started when a poll is submitted to lower layer. If x is the value of
the state variable VT(S) after the poll was submitted to lower layer,
the timer shall be stopped upon receiving:

\- positive acknowledgements for all the AMD PDUs with \"Sequence
Number\" up to and including x - 1; or

\- a negative acknowledgement for the AMD PDU with \"Sequence Number\" =
x - 1.

If the timer expires and no STATUS PDU fulfilling the criteria above has
been received:

\- the Receiver shall be polled once more;

\- the timer shall be restarted; and

\- the new value of VT(S) shall be saved.

If a new poll is sent when the timer is active, the timer shall be
restarted at the time specified above, and the value of VT(S) shall be
saved.

b\) Timer\_Poll\_Prohibit.

This timer shall only be used when so configured by upper layers. It is
used to prohibit transmission of polls within a certain period. The
value of the timer is signalled by upper layers.

In the UE this timer shall be started (or restarted) when the successful
or unsuccessful transmission of a poll is indicated by lower layer. In
UTRAN it should be started when a poll is submitted to lower layer.

From the time a poll is triggered until the timer expires, polling is
prohibited. If another poll is triggered while polling is prohibited,
its transmission shall be delayed until the timer expires (see subclause
9.7.1). Only one poll shall be transmitted when Timer\_Poll\_Prohibit
expires even if several polls were triggered in the meantime. This timer
shall not be affected by the reception of STATUS PDUs.

When Timer\_Poll\_Prohibit is not configured by upper layers, polling is
never prohibited.

c\) Void

d\) Timer\_Discard.

This timer shall be used when timer-based SDU discard is configured by
upper layers. The value of the timer is signalled by upper layers. In
the transmitter, a new timer is started upon reception of an SDU from
upper layer.

In UM/TM, if a timer expires before the corresponding SDU is submitted
to lower layer, \"SDU discard without explicit signalling\" specified in
subclauses 11.2.4.3 and 11.1.4.2 shall be initiated. In AM, if a timer
expires before the corresponding SDU is acknowledged, \"SDU discard with
explicit signalling\" specified in subclause 11.6 shall be initiated.

e\) Timer\_Poll\_Periodic.

This timer shall only be used when \"timer based polling\" is configured
by upper layers. The value of the timer is signalled by upper layers.
The timer shall be started when the RLC entity is created. When the
timer expires, the RLC entity shall:

\- restart the timer;

\- if AMD PDUs are available for transmission or retransmission (not yet
acknowledged):

\- trigger a poll.

f\) Timer\_Status\_Prohibit.

This timer shall only be used when so configured by upper layers. It is
meant to prohibit the Receiver from sending consecutive acknowledgement
status reports. A status report is an acknowledgement status report if
it contains any of the SUFIs LIST, BITMAP, RLIST or ACK. The value of
the timer is signalled by upper layers.

In the UE, this timer shall be started (or restarted) when the
successful or unsuccessful transmission of the last STATUS PDU of an
acknowledgement status report is indicated by lower layer. In UTRAN it
should be started when the last STATUS PDU of an acknowledgement status
report is submitted to lower layer.

From the time an acknowledgement status report is triggered until the
Timer\_Status\_Prohibit timer expires, acknowledgement is prohibited. If
another such status report is triggered while acknowledgement is
prohibited, its transmission shall be delayed until the timer expires
(see subclause 9.7.2). The status report may be updated during this
time. The transmission of SUFIs MRW, MRW\_ACK, WINDOW or NO\_MORE is not
restricted.

When Timer\_Status\_Prohibit is not configured by upper layers,
acknowledgment is not prohibited.

g\) Timer\_Status\_Periodic.

This timer shall only be used when timer based status reporting is
configured by upper layers.

This timer shall be started when the RLC entity is created. When the
timer expires the transmission of a status report shall be triggered and
the timer shall be restarted. This timer can be blocked by upper layers.
The timer shall be restarted when upper layers indicate that it is no
longer blocked.

h\) Timer\_RST.

This timer is meant to handle the loss of a RESET PDU by the peer
entity, or the loss of a RESET ACK PDU from the peer entity. The value
of the timer is signalled by upper layers.

In the UE this timer shall be started (or restarted) when the successful
or unsuccessful transmission of a RESET PDU is indicated by lower layer.
In UTRAN it should be started when a RESET PDU is submitted to lower
layer.

Timer\_RST shall only be stopped upon reception of a RESET ACK PDU (with
same RSN as RESET PDU), i.e. this timer shall not be stopped when an RLC
reset initiated by the peer RLC entity occurs. If this timer expires,
the RESET PDU shall be retransmitted.

i\) Timer\_MRW.

This timer is used to trigger the retransmission of a status report
containing an MRW SUFI field. The value of the timer is signalled by
upper layers.

In the UE this timer shall be started (or restarted) when the successful
or unsuccessful transmission of a STATUS PDU containing the MRW SUFI is
indicated by lower layer. In UTRAN, it should be started when a STATUS
PDU containing the MRW SUFI is submitted to lower layer.

Each time the timer expires the MRW SUFI is retransmitted. It shall be
stopped when one of the termination criteria for the SDU discard with
explicit signalling procedure is fulfilled (see subclause 11.6.4).

j\) Timer\_OSD

> This timer is used with UM out of sequence SDU delivery. It is used to
> trigger the deleting of stored PDUs.
>
> The timer is started and stopped according to subclause 11.2.3.2.

k\) Timer\_DAR

> This timer is used with the UM duplicate avoidance and reordering
> function. It is used to trigger the transfer of PDUs to the next in
> sequence UM RLC receiver function.
>
> The timer is started and stopped according to subclause 9.7.10.

l\) Timer\_Reordering

> This timer shall only be used when so configured by upper layers.
>
> The timer is started and stopped according to 11.3.3. There is only
> one Timer\_Reordering running at a given time. While it is running,
> any positive or negative acknowledgment is prohibited. The status
> report may be updated during this time.

9.6 Protocol Parameters
-----------------------

The behaviour defined in this subclause is normative. The values of the
protocol parameters defined in this subclause are signalled by upper
layers.

a\) MaxDAT.

The maximum number of transmissions of an AMD PDU is equal to MaxDAT --
1. This protocol parameter represents the upper limit for state variable
VT(DAT). When VT(DAT) equals the value MaxDAT, either RLC RESET
procedure or SDU discard procedure shall be initiated according to the
configuration by upper layers.

b\) Poll\_PDU.

This protocol parameter indicates how often the transmitter shall poll
the Receiver in the case where \"polling every Poll\_PDU PDU\" is
configured by upper layers. It represents the upper limit for the state
variable VT(PDU). When VT(PDU) equals the value Poll\_PDU a poll shall
be transmitted to the peer entity.

c\) Poll\_SDU.

This protocol parameter indicates how often the transmitter shall poll
the Receiver in the case where \"polling every Poll\_SDU SDU\" is
configured by upper layers. It represents the upper limit for state
variable VT(SDU). When VT(SDU) equals the value Poll\_SDU a poll shall
be transmitted to the peer entity.

d\) Poll\_Window.

This protocol parameter indicates when the transmitter shall poll the
Receiver in the case where \"window-based polling\" is configured by
upper layers. A poll is triggered for each AMD PDU when J ≥
Poll\_Window, where J is the transmission window percentage defined as:

> where the constant 4096 is the modulus for AM described in subclause
> 9.4 and VT(S) is the value of the variable before the AMD PDU is
> submitted to lower layer.

e\) MaxRST.

The maximum number of transmissions of a RESET PDU is equal to MaxRST --
1. This protocol parameter represents the upper limit for state variable
VT(RST). When VT(RST) equals the value MaxRST, unrecoverable error shall
be indicated to upper layers.

f\) Configured\_Tx\_Window\_Size.

This protocol parameter indicates both the maximum allowed transmission
window size and the value for the state variable VT(WS).

g\) Configured\_Rx\_Window\_Size.

This protocol parameter indicates the reception window size. This
parameter is applicable both for RLC UM and AM. This parameter is only
configured for RLC-UM in case out-of-sequence reception is supported.

h\) MaxMRW.

The maximum number of transmissions of an MRW command is equal to
MaxMRW. This protocol parameter represents the upper limit for state
variable VT(MRW). When VT(MRW) equals the value MaxMRW, the RLC RESET
procedure shall be initiated.

i\) OSD\_Window\_Size.

This protocol parameter indicates the size of the out of sequence SDU
delivery storage window.

j\) DAR\_Window\_Size.

This protocol parameter indicates the size of the duplicate avoidance
and reordering receive window.

9.7 Specific functions
----------------------

The functions defined in this subclause are normative.

### 9.7.1 Polling function for acknowledged mode

The Polling function is used by the Sender to request the peer RLC
entity for a status report. The \"Polling bit\" in the AMD PDU or the
POLL SUFI indicate the poll request. There are several triggers for
initiating the Polling function. Which of the triggers shall be used is
configured by upper layers for each RLC entity. The following triggers
can be configured:

1\) Last PDU in buffer.

When an AMD PDU to be transmitted for the first time is submitted to
lower layer, the Sender shall:

\- if the AMD PDU is the last AMD PDU scheduled for transmission
according to subclause 11.3.2 (i.e. no data received from upper layer
remains to be segmented into AMD PDUs); or

\- if the AMD PDU is the last AMD PDU that is allowed to transmit
according to subclause 11.3.2.2:

\- trigger a poll for this AMD PDU.

2\) Last PDU in Retransmission buffer.

When a retransmitted AMD PDU is submitted to lower layer, the Sender
shall:

\- if the AMD PDU is the last AMD PDU scheduled for retransmission
according to subclause 11.3.2; or

\- if the AMD PDU is the last of the AMD PDUs scheduled for
retransmission that are allowed to transmit according to subclause
11.3.2.2:

\- trigger a poll for this AMD PDU.

3\) Poll timer.

The timer Timer\_Poll is started and stopped according to subclause 9.5
a). When the timer Timer\_Poll expires the Sender triggers the Polling
function.

4\) Every Poll\_PDU PDU.

The Sender triggers the Polling function for every Poll\_PDU PDU. Both
retransmitted and new AMD PDUs shall be counted.

5\) Every Poll\_SDU SDU.

The Sender triggers the Polling function for every Poll\_SDU SDU. The
poll shall be triggered for the first transmission of the AMD PDU that
contains the last segment of an RLC SDU (indicated either by the
\"Length Indicator\" indicating the end of the SDU or by the special
value of the HE field).

6\) Window based.

The Sender triggers the Polling function when the condition described in
subclause 9.6 d) (\"Poll\_Window\") is fulfilled.

7\) Timer based.

The Sender triggers the Polling function periodically.

UTRAN should configure RLC to avoid deadlock situations.

The Poll Prohibit function is used by the Sender to delay the initiation
of the Polling function. Usage of the Poll Prohibit function is
configured by upper layers. The Poll Prohibit function consists of
starting the timer Timer\_Poll\_Prohibit according to subclause 9.5 b)
and delaying the Polling function according to the following rules:

When the Polling function is triggered, the Sender shall:

\- if polling is not prohibited (see subclause 9.5 b)); and

\- if there is one or more AMD PDUs to be transmitted or there are AMD
PDUs not acknowledged by the Receiver:

\- initiate the Polling function by setting the polling bit according to
subclause 11.3.2.1.1.

\- otherwise (if there is no PDU to be transmitted and all PDUs have
already been acknowledged):

\- not initiate the Polling function.

Upon expiry of the timer Timer\_Poll\_Prohibit, the Sender shall:

\- if the Polling function was triggered at least once while the timer
Timer\_Poll\_Prohibit was active; and

\- if there is one or more AMD PDUs to be transmitted or there are AMD
PDUs not acknowledged by the Receiver:

\- initiate the Polling function once by setting the polling bit
according to subclause 11.3.2.1.1.

\- otherwise (if there is no PDU to be transmitted and all PDUs have
already been acknowledged):

\- not initiate the Polling function.

NOTE 1: In downlink, UTRAN can initiate the Polling function by
assembling a POLL SUFI according to subclause 9.2.2.11.9 when \"flexible
RLC PDU size\" in downlink is configured.

NOTE 2: In uplink, the UE can initiate the Polling function by
assembling a POLL SUFI according to subclause 9.2.2.11.9 when \"flexible
RLC PDU size\" in uplink is configured.

### 9.7.2 STATUS transmission for acknowledged mode

The Receiver transmits status reports to the Sender in order to inform
the Sender about which AMD PDUs have been received and not received.
Each status report consists of one or several STATUS PDUs. The Receiver
shall trigger the transmission of a status report when receiving a poll
request. Additionally, the following triggers for transmission of status
reports are configurable by upper layers:

1\) Detection of missing PDU(s).

If the Receiver detects one or several missing AMD PDUs it shall trigger
the transmission of a status report to the Sender.

2\) Timer based status report transfer.

The Receiver triggers the transmission of a status report to the Sender
periodically. The timer Timer\_Status\_Periodic controls the time period
according to subclause 9.5 g). When \"Periodical Status blocking\" is
configured by upper layers, the trigger shall not be active.

3\) Void

There are several functions that can prohibit the Receiver from sending
a status report containing any of the SUFIs LIST, BITMAP, RLIST or ACK.
Status reports containing other SUFIs are not prohibited. Upper layers
control which functions should be used for each RLC entity. If any of
the following functions is used the transmission of the status report
shall be delayed, even if any of the triggering conditions above are
fulfilled:

1\) STATUS prohibit.

The timer Timer\_Status\_Prohibit is started according to subclause 9.5
f). The Receiver is not allowed to transmit a status report while
acknowledgement is prohibited (see subclause 9.5 f)). If a status report
was triggered during this time, the status report is transmitted after
the timer Timer\_Status\_Prohibit has expired, as described below.

2\) Void

3\) Timer\_Reordering

The timer Timer\_Reordering is started according to subclause 11.3.3.
The receiver is not allowed to transmit a status report while the timer
is running. If a status report was triggered during this time, the
status report is transmitted after the timer Timer\_Reordering has
expired, as described below.

When a status report is triggered the Receiver shall:

\- if transmission of status reports is not prohibited by any of the
functions \"STATUS prohibit\" or \"Timer\_Reordering\":

\- assemble and transmit the status report to the Sender, as specified
in subclauses 11.5.2.2 and 11.5.2.3.

\- otherwise (if the status report is prohibited by at least one of the
functions \"STATUS prohibit\"):

\- if MRW, MRW\_ACK, WINDOW or POLL SUFIs are required in the status
report:

\- send a status report immediately excluding ACK, LIST, BITMAP, and
RLIST SUFIs;

\- if ACK, LIST, BITMAP, or RLIST SUFIs are required in the status
report:

\- delay sending these SUFIs until the prohibit function terminates.

Upon expiry of the timer Timer\_Status\_Prohibit, the Receiver shall:

\- if at least one status report was triggered during the time the
transmission of a status reports was prohibited that could not be
transmitted due to prohibition; and

\- if transmission of a status reports is no longer prohibited by any of
the functions \"STATUS prohibit\" or \"Timer\_Reordering\":

\- transmit one status report to the Sender, using the procedure
described in subclause 11.5.2.3.

Upon expiry of the timer Timer\_Reordering, the Receiver shall:

\- if at least one status report was triggered during the time the
transmission of a status reports was prohibited that could not be
transmitted due to prohibition; and

\- if transmission of a status reports is no longer prohibited by any of
the functions \"STATUS prohibit\" or \"Timer\_Reordering\":

\- update VR(MS) to the SN of the first AMD PDU with SN \>= VR(X) which
has not been received;

\- transmit one status report to the Sender, using the procedure
described in subclause 11.5.2.3.

\- if VR(H) \> VR(MS):

\- start Timer\_Reordering;

\- set VR(X) to VR(H).

### 9.7.3 SDU discard function for acknowledged, unacknowledged, and transparent mode

The SDU discard function is used by the Sender to discharge RLC PDUs
from the RLC PDU buffer, when the transmission of the RLC PDUs does not
succeed for a period of time or for a number of transmissions. The SDU
discard function allows to avoid buffer overflow. There are several
alternative operation modes of the RLC SDU discard function. Upper
layers control, which discard function shall be used for each RLC
entity.

The following is a list of operation modes for the RLC SDU discard
function, which are described in detail in the subsequent subclauses.

Table 9.2: List of criteria that control when to perform SDU discard

  -------------------------------------------------- --------------------
  Operation mode                                     Presence
  Timer based discard, with explicit signalling      Network controlled
  Timer based discard, without explicit signalling   Network controlled
  SDU discard after MaxDAT number of transmissions   Network controlled
  No\_discard after MaxDAT number of transmissions   Network controlled
  -------------------------------------------------- --------------------

#### 9.7.3.1 Timer based discard, with explicit signalling

This alternative is only applicable to RLC entities operating in
acknowledged mode. It uses a timer based triggering of SDU discard
(Timer\_Discard). This makes the SDU discard function insensitive to
variations in the channel rate and provides means for exact definition
of maximum delay. However, the SDU loss rate of the connection is
increased as SDUs are discarded.

For every SDU received from upper layers, the Sender shall:

\- start a timer Timer\_Discard.

When the timer Timer\_Discard of a SDU expires, the Sender shall:

\- discard the SDU;

\- if \"Send MRW\" is configured, or one or more segments of the
discarded SDU were submitted to the lower layer:

\- utilise explicit signalling to inform the Receiver according to
subclause 11.6.

NOTE: The support of the configuration \"Send MRW\" and the
functionality connected with this configuration is implementation
dependent.

#### 9.7.3.2 Timer based discard, without explicit signalling

This alternative is only applicable to RLC entities operating in
unacknowledged or transparent mode. It uses the same timer based trigger
for SDU discard (Timer\_Discard) as the one described in the
subclause 9.7.3.1. The difference is that this discard method does not
use any peer-to-peer signalling.

For every SDU received from upper layers, the Sender shall:

\- start timer monitoring of the transmission time of the SDU.

When the transmission time exceeds the configured value for a SDU, the
Sender shall:

\- discard the SDU without explicit signalling (for RLC entities
operating in unacknowledged mode apply subclause 11.2.4.3 for updating
the state variables).

#### 9.7.3.3 SDU discard after MaxDAT number of transmissions

This alternative uses the number of transmissions as a trigger for SDU
discard, and is therefore only applicable for acknowledged mode RLC.
This makes the SDU discard function dependent on the channel rate. Also,
this variant of the SDU discard function strives to keep the SDU loss
rate constant for the connection, on the cost of a variable delay.

If the number of times an AMD PDU is scheduled for transmission reaches
MaxDAT, the Sender shall:

\- discard all SDUs that have segments or \"Length Indicators\"
indicating the end of the SDUs in the AMD PDU; and

\- utilise explicit signalling to inform the Receiver according to
clause 11.6.

#### 9.7.3.4 No\_discard after MaxDAT number of transmissions

This alternative uses the number of transmissions, and is therefore only
applicable for acknowledged mode RLC.

If the number of times an AMD PDU is scheduled for transmission reaches
MaxDAT, the Sender shall:

\- initiate the RLC Reset procedure (see subclause 11.3.4.4).

#### 9.7.3.5 SDU discard not configured

If SDU discard has not been configured for an unacknowledged mode RLC
entity, SDUs in the transmitter shall not be discarded unless the
Transmission buffer is full.

When the Transmission buffer in an unacknowledged mode RLC entity is
full, the Sender may:

\- if segments of the SDU to be discarded have been submitted to lower
layer:

\- discard the SDU without explicit signalling according to subclause
11.2.4.3.

\- otherwise, if no segments of the SDU to be discarded have been
submitted to lower layer:

\- remove the SDU from the Transmission buffer without utilising any of
the discard procedures.

If SDU discard has not been configured for a transparent mode RLC
entity, the Sender shall upon reception of new SDUs from upper layer:

\- discard all SDUs received from upper layer in previous TTIs that are
not yet submitted to lower layer;

\- submit the new SDUs in the first possible TTI.

For an acknowledged mode RLC entity, an SDU discard mode is always
configured.

### 9.7.4 Void

### 9.7.5 Local Suspend function for acknowledged and unacknowledged mode

The upper layers may suspend an RLC entity.

When an RLC entity operating in unacknowledged mode is suspended by
upper layers with the parameter N, the RLC entity shall:

\- acknowledge the suspend request with a confirmation containing the
current value of VT(US);

\- not send UMD PDUs with \"Sequence Number\" SN≥VT(US)+N.

When an RLC entity operating in acknowledged mode is suspended by upper
layers with the parameter N, the RLC entity shall:

\- acknowledge the suspend request with a confirmation containing the
current value of VT(S);

\- not send AMD PDUs with \"Sequence Number\" SN≥VT(S)+N.

When an RLC entity operating in unacknowledged mode is resumed by upper
layers, the RLC entity shall:

\- resume data transfer procedure.

When an RLC entity operating in acknowledged mode is resumed by upper
layers, the RLC entity shall:

\- if the RLC entity is suspended and a RLC Reset procedure is not
ongoing:

\- resume data transfer procedure.

\- otherwise, if the RLC entity is suspended and a RLC Reset procedure
is ongoing:

\- remove the suspend constraint;

\- resume the RLC reset procedure according to subclause 11.4.

### 9.7.6 RLC Stop, RLC Continue function for acknowledged and unacknowledged mode

The upper layer may stop an RLC entity.

When an RLC entity is stopped, the RLC timers are not affected.

When a RLC entity is stopped by upper layers, the RLC entity shall:

\- not submit any RLC PDUs to lower layer or receive any RLC PDUs;

\- delay triggered Polling functions or status transmissions until the
RLC entity is continued.

NOTE: If the TFC selection exchange has been initiated by sending the
RLC Entity Info parameter to MAC, the RLC entity may delay the stop
function until the end of the next TTI.

When a RLC entity is continued by upper layers, the RLC entity shall:

\- if the RLC entity is stopped:

\- continue the data transmission and reception;

\- process the triggered Polling functions and status transmissions.

\- otherwise, if the RLC is not stopped:

\- take no action.

### 9.7.7 RLC re-establishment function for acknowledged and unacknowledged mode

RLC re-establishment is performed upon request by upper layers.

The RLC re-establishment function is applicable for AM or UM RLC. For
UM, the whole RLC entity is re-established. For AM, upper layers may
request re-establishment of the whole RLC entity or only the
transmitting or receiving side of the RLC entity.

When an UM RLC entity is re-established by upper layers, the RLC entity
shall:

\- reset the state variables to their initial value;

\- set the configurable parameters to their configured value;

\- set the hyper frame number (HFN) to the value configured by upper
layers;

\- if it is a receiving UM RLC entity:

\- discard all UMD PDUs.

\- stop all timers;

\- if it is a transmitting UM RLC entity:

\- discard the RLC SDUs for which one or more segments have been
submitted to a lower layer;

\- if requested:

\- inform the upper layers of the discarded SDUs.

\- not stop Timer\_Discard if the RLC SDU is not discarded.

When the transmitting and/or receiving side of an AM RLC entity is
re-established by upper layers, the RLC entity shall:

\- if the receiving side of the RLC entity is re-established:

\- reset the state variables specified for the receiver in subclause 9.4
to their initial values;

\- set the configurable parameters applicable for the receiving side in
subclause 9.6 to their configured values;

\- set the hyper frame number (HFN) in the receiving side (DL in the UE)
to the value configured by upper layers;

\- discard the AMD PDUs in the receiving side.

\- if only the receiving side of the RLC entity is re-established:

\- discard acknowledgement status report, WINDOW SUFI and MRW\_ACK SUFI
in all STATUS PDUs and piggybacked STATUS PDUs, RESET PDU and RESET ACK
PDU (i.e. discard all control PDUs except MRW SUFI and POLL SUFI);

\- if an RLC reset procedure is ongoing (i.e. Timer\_RST is running):

\- stop Timer\_RST;

\- abort the ongoing RLC reset procedure;

\- reset VT(RST);

\- restart a new RLC reset procedure after the RLC re-establishment
terminates.

\- stop Timer\_Status\_Prohibit;

\- for the remaining control PDUs and SUFI that were scheduled for
transmission before re-establishment but were not delivered to lower
layer:

\- assemble the control PDUs and SUFIs that were not discarded into new
control PDUs with the configured RLC PDU size;

\- schedule the new control PDUs for transmission.

\- if the transmitting side of the RLC entity is re-established:

\- reset the state variables specified for the sender in subclause 9.4
to their initial values;

\- set the configurable parameters applicable for the transmitting side
in subclause 9.6 to their configured values;

\- set the hyper frame number (HFN) in the transmitting side (UL in the
UE) to the value configured by upper layers;

\- discard SDUs in the transmitting side that have been completely
transmitted (the AMD PDUs containing segments of the SDU and the
\"Length Indicator\" indicating the end of the SDU have been
transmitted);

\- the UE may also discard partially transmitted SDUs (at least one AMD
PDU containing a segment of the SDU has been transmitted);

\- segment the SDUs that were not discarded into AMD PDUs with the
configured RLC PDU size (that may be different from the size before the
re-establishment);

\- if only the transmitter side of the RLC entity is re-established:

\- discard MRW SUFI and POLL SUFI in all STATUS PDUs and piggybacked
STATUS PDUs, RESET PDU and RESET ACK PDU (i.e. discard all control PDUs
except acknowledgement status report, WINDOW SUFI and MRW\_ACK SUFI);

\- for the remaining control PDUs and SUFI that were scheduled for
transmission before re-establishment but were not delivered to lower
layer:

\- assemble the control PDUs and SUFIs that were not discarded into new
control PDUs with the configured RLC PDU size;

\- schedule the control PDUs for transmission.

\- if an RLC reset procedure is ongoing (i.e. Timer\_RST is running):

\- stop Timer\_RST;

\- abort the ongoing RLC reset procedure;

\- restart a new RLC reset procedure after the RLC re-establishment
terminates.

\- stop Timer\_Poll, Timer\_MRW and Timer\_Poll\_Prohibit.

\- if both the transmitter and receiver side of the RLC entity is
re-established:

\- discard the control PDUs in both transmitting and receiving side and
the AMD PDUs in the transmitting side;

\- if an RLC reset procedure is ongoing (i.e. Timer\_RST is running):

\- abort the ongoing RLC reset procedure.

\- stop all timers described in subclause 9.5 except
Timer\_Poll\_Periodic and Timer\_Status\_Periodic, and Timer\_Discard
for SDUs that have not been discarded.

\- if requested:

\- inform the upper layers of the discarded SDUs.

NOTE: If the TFC selection exchange has been initiated by sending the
RLC Entity Info parameter to MAC, the RLC entity may delay the
re-establishment function until the end of the next TTI.

### 9.7.8 Ciphering for acknowledged and unacknowledged mode

The ciphering function is performed in RLC, according to the following
rules if a radio bearer is using a non-transparent RLC mode (AM or UM).
The data unit that is ciphered, depends on the transmission mode as
described below.

\- For RLC UM mode, the ciphering unit is the UMD PDU excluding the
first octet, i.e. excluding the UMD PDU header. This is shown below in
Figure 9.19.

Figure 9.19: Ciphering unit for a UMD PDU

\- For RLC AM mode, the ciphering unit is the AMD PDU excluding the
first two octets, i.e. excluding the AMD PDU header. This is shown below
in Figure 9.20.

Figure 9.20: Ciphering unit for an AMD PDU

The ciphering algorithm and key to be used are configured by upper
layers \[8\] and the ciphering method shall be applied as specified in
\[9\].

The parameters that are required by RLC for ciphering are defined in
\[9\] and are input to the ciphering algorithm. The parameters required
by RLC which are provided by upper layers \[8\] are listed below:

\- RLC AM HFN (Hyper frame number for radio bearers that are mapped onto
RLC AM);

\- RLC UM HFN (Hyper frame number for radio bearers that are mapped onto
RLC UM);

\- BEARER (defined as the radio bearer identifier in \[9\]. It will use
the value RB identity --1 as in \[8\]);

\- CK (Ciphering Key).

### 9.7.9 Reconfiguration of RLC parameters by upper layers

The RLC parameters for an RLC entity may be reconfigured (modified) by
upper layers.

When an RLC parameter is reconfigured by the upper layer, the UE shall:

\- start using the reconfigured value of the RLC parameter.

If the parameter Configured\_Rx\_Window\_Size is reconfigured:

\- the UE shall update the state variable VR(UM), (see clause 9.4);

> \- the UE shall update the state variable VR(MR), (see clause 9.4);

\- for AMD PDUs with \"Sequence Number\" x such that VR(MR)\<=x\<VR(H):

> \- the UE may discard these AMD PDUs; if discarded, the state variable
> VR(H) should be updated accordingly;
>
> \- consider the discarded AMD PDUs as not having been received.

If the parameter Configured\_Tx\_Window\_Size is reconfigured:

> \- the UE shall set the state variable VT(WS) equal to the
> Configured\_Tx\_Window\_Size;
>
> \- the UE shall update the state variable VT(MS), (see subclause 9.4);
>
> \- for AMD PDUs with \"Sequence Number\" x such that
> VT(MS)\<=x\<VT(S):
>
> \- the UE shall not discard any AMD PDUs that are not positively
> acknowledged;
>
> \- the UE may discard AMD PDUs that are positively acknowledged.
>
> When the transmission window size or the reception window size is
> reconfigured the required buffer memory may temporarily exceed the
> size of the configured window and thus exceed the available buffer
> memory (see subclause 11.3.4.9).

If the parameter OSD\_Window\_Size is reconfigured:

\- the UE shall remove from storage any PDUs whose sequence numbers, SN,
are outside of the storage window VR(UOH) [\>=]{.underline} SN \>
VR(UOH) -- OSD\_Window\_Size.

If the parameter DAR\_Window\_Size is reconfigured:

\- the UE shall remove from storage any PDUs whose sequence numbers are
outside of the storage window and deliver them to the higher RLC
function to perform reassembly specified in subclause 11.2.3 and update
the state variable VR(UDR) as specified in subclause 9.7.10;

\- the UE shall update the state variables VR(UDT) and operate the timer
Timer\_DAR if needed (see subclause 9.7.10).

### 9.7.10 Duplicate avoidance and reordering for unacknowledged mode

The duplicate avoidance and reordering function can be configured for
use within a receiving UM RLC entity in the UE. It combines PDU
sequences received from several sources and/or repeat transmissions from
a single source to form a single ordered PDU sequence that is passed to
the header removal and reassembly functions. It completes duplicate
detection, discard and re-ordering based on the UM PDU sequence number.
Where the UM RLC receives input from several sources, inputs can be
added or removed without changing the buffer contents, state variables
and timers associated with the duplicate avoidance and reordering
function or any subsequent UM RLC function.

The duplicate avoidance and reordering function makes use of the state
variable VR(UDR) and a receive window whose span is from VR(UDH) --
DAR\_Window\_Size + 1 to VR(UDH) inclusively. For re-ordering the
function uses a buffer for the temporary storage of PDUs.

For each PDU received, the duplicate avoidance and reordering function
shall (in the following SN denotes the sequence number of each PDU):

Setting initial values of state variables:

> \- If the PDU is the first PDU received by the duplicate avoidance and
> reordering function after establishment or re-establishment:
>
> \- VR(UDH) is assigned the value SN;
>
> \- VR(UDR) is assigned the value VR(UDH) -- DAR\_Window\_Size + 1.

Duplicate detection and re-ordering:

> \- if SN is within the receive window:
>
> \- if SN \< VR(UDR) or if a PDU with sequence number SN is already
> stored in the buffer:
>
> \- the PDU shall be discarded;
>
> \- else:
>
> \- the PDU shall be stored in the buffer.
>
> \- if SN is outside of the receive window:
>
> \- the PDU shall be stored in the buffer;
>
> \- VR(UDH) shall be assigned the value SN, thereby advancing the
> receive window;
>
> \- for any stored PDUs with sequence numbers \< VR(UDH) --
> DAR\_Window\_Size + 1, i.e. outside the receive window after its
> position is updated, remove the PDU from the buffer and deliver them
> to the higher RLC function to perform the actions specified in
> subclause 11.2.3;
>
> \- if VR(UDR) \< VR(UDH) -- DAR\_Window\_Size + 1, i.e. VR(UDR) is
> outside the updated receive window;
>
> \- VR(UDR) shall be assigned the value VR(UDH) -- DAR\_Window\_Size +
> 1.
>
> \- if PDU with sequence number VR(UDR) is stored in the buffer:
>
> \- for this PDU and any sequence of stored PDUs with consecutive
> sequence numbers starting at VR(UDR) + 1, remove the PDUs from the
> buffer and deliver them to the higher RLC function to perform the
> actions specified in subclause 11.2.3;
>
> \- VR(UDR) shall be assigned the value of x + 1 where x is the
> sequence number of the highest numbered PDU that was delivered to the
> higher RLC function.

Timer operation:

> \- if Timer\_DAR is not active when a PDU is stored with SN \> VR(UDR)
> by the duplicate avoidance and reordering function:
>
> \- Timer\_DAR shall be started;
>
> \- VR(UDT) shall be assigned the value of the sequence number of the
> PDU.
>
> \- Timer\_DAR shall be stopped:
>
> \- if the PDU with sequence number VR(UDT) is removed from the buffer
> before Timer\_DAR expires.
>
> \- if Timer\_DAR expires:
>
> \- for all stored PDUs with sequence numbers lower or equal to VR(UDT)
> and for any sequence of stored PDUs with consecutive sequence numbers
> starting at VR(UDT) + 1, remove the PDUs from the buffer and deliver
> them to the higher RLC function to perform the actions specified in
> subclause 11.2.3;
>
> \- VR(UDR) shall be assigned the value x + 1 where x is the sequence
> number of the highest numbered PDU that was delivered to the higher
> RLC function.

\- When Timer\_DAR is stopped or expires, and there remain PDUs stored
by the duplicate avoidance and reordering function:

> \- Timer\_DAR shall be started;

\- VR(UDT) shall be assigned the sequence number of the highest numbered
stored PDU.

10 Handling of unknown, unforeseen and erroneous protocol data
==============================================================

Errors and the handling of errors defined in this clause are normative.

10.1 Erroneous Sequence Number
------------------------------

A STATUS PDU or Piggybacked STATUS PDU including \"erroneous Sequence
Number\" is a STATUS PDU or Piggybacked STATUS PDU that contains:

\- a LIST, BITMAP or RLIST SUFI in which the \"Sequence Number\" of at
least one AMD PDU that is negatively acknowledged is outside the
interval VT(A)≤\"Sequence Number\"\< VT(S); or

\- an ACK SUFI in which \"LSN\" is outside the interval VT(A)≤\"LSN\"≤
VT(S).

If an AM RLC entity receives a STATUS PDU or a Piggybacked STATUS PDU
including \"erroneous Sequence Number\", it shall:

\- discard the STATUS PDU or the Piggybacked STATUS PDU;

\- if inter-Node B Multiflow operation is not configured by higher
layers, initiate the RLC reset procedure (see subclause 11.4).

10.2 Inconsistent status indication
-----------------------------------

If an AM RLC entity receives a STATUS PDU or a Piggybacked STATUS PDU
that indicates different status for the same AMD PDU, it shall:

\- discard the STATUS PDU or the Piggybacked STATUS PDU.

10.3 Invalid PDU format
-----------------------

If an UM or AM RLC entity receives a RLC PDU that contains reserved or
invalid values (see subclause 9.2), it shall:

\- discard the RLC PDU.

10.4 RLC PDU with CRC error
---------------------------

If an UM or AM RLC entity receives a RLC PDU with an error indication,
it shall:

\- discard the RLC PDU.

If a TM RLC entity receives a RLC PDU with an error indication, it
shall:

\- if \"Delivery of Erroneous SDUs\" is configured:

\- process the RLC PDU according to subclause 11.1.3;

\- otherwise:

\- discard the RLC PDU.

11 Elementary procedures
========================

Procedures defined in this clause are normative.

This description assumes elementary procedures. Interactions between
procedures are not described.

11.1 Transparent mode data transfer procedure
---------------------------------------------

### 11.1.1 General

The transparent mode data transfer procedure is used for transferring
data between two RLC peer entities, which are operating in transparent
mode. Data is transferred from Sender to Receiver. This procedure should
only apply to entities in DATA\_TRANSFER\_READY state. Figure 11.1 below
illustrates the elementary procedure for transparent mode data transfer.

Channels that can be used are DTCH, CCCH (uplink only), SHCCH (uplink
only), BCCH and PCCH. The type of logical channel depends on if the RLC
entity is located in the user plane (DTCH) or in the control plane
(CCCH/BCCH/SHCCH/PCCH).

Figure 11.1: Transparent mode data transfer procedure

### 11.1.2 Transmission of TMD PDU

Upon a request of transparent mode data transfer from upper layer, the
Sender shall:

\- if no SDU discard configuration has been made by upper layers:

\- discard SDUs received in previous TTIs upon reception of new SDUs
from upper layers (see subclause 9.7.3.5);

\- otherwise (if \"Timer Based SDU Discard without explicit signalling\"
is configured):

\- start a timer Timer\_Discard for each SDU received from upper layers
(see subclause 9.7.3);

\- schedule the RLC SDUs that have been received from upper layer for
transmission;

\- if one or more RLC SDUs have been scheduled for transmission:

\- notify the lower layer of reception of data from upper layers;

\- perform the actions specified in subclause 11.1.2.2.

#### 11.1.2.1 TMD PDU contents to set

The Sender shall set the data field of the TMD PDU to all or a subset of
the data contained in the SDU as described in subclause 11.1.2.2.

#### 11.1.2.2 Submission of TMD PDUs to the lower layer

If one or more RLC SDUs have been scheduled for transmission, according
to subclause 11.1.2, the Sender shall:

\- if it is configured for segmented operation:

\- inform the lower layer of the size of the next SDU to be sent;

\- segment the SDU according to the PDU size indicated by the lower
layer.

\- otherwise (the Sender is configured for non-segmented operation):

\- inform the lower layer of the number and size of SDUs available for
transmission;

\- submit to the lower layer, the requested number of TMD PDUs;

\- buffer the SDUs that are not submitted to the lower layer according
to the discard configuration (see subclause 9.7.3).

### 11.1.3 Reception of TMD PDU

Upon delivery by the lower layer of a set of TMD PDUs (received within
one TTI), the Receiver shall:

\- if it is configured for segmented operation:

\- reassemble the TMD PDUs received in one TTI into one RLC SDU.

\- otherwise (it is configured for non-segmented operation):

\- treat each received TMD PDU as a SDU;

\- if \"Delivery of Erroneous SDUs\" is configured as \"no\":

\- submit only the RLC SDUs received without error to upper layers
through the TM-SAP.

\- else if \"Delivery of Erroneous SDUs\" is configured as \"yes\":

\- submit all RLC SDUs to upper layers through the TM-SAP;

\- provide an error indication for each SDU received in error.

\- otherwise if \"Delivery of Erroneous SDUs\" is configured as \"No
detect\":

\- submit all RLC SDUs to upper layers through the TM-SAP.

If segmentation is performed in transparent mode RLC, an SDU is
erroneous if one or more of the TMD PDUs received in a TTI contains an
error. If segmentation is not performed, an SDU is erroneous if the
corresponding TMD PDU is erroneous.

### 11.1.4 Abnormal cases

#### 11.1.4.1 Void

#### 11.1.4.2 SDU discard without explicit signalling

Upon expiry of the timer Timer\_Discard in the Sender, the Sender shall:

\- discard the associated SDU;

\- if requested:

\- inform the upper layers of the discarded SDU.

In the case where the TFC selection exchange has been initiated by
sending the RLC Entity Info parameter to MAC, the UE may wait until
after it provides MAC with the requested set of PDUs before discarding
the afore-mentioned SDU.

11.2 Unacknowledged mode data transfer procedure
------------------------------------------------

### 11.2.1 General

The unacknowledged mode data transfer procedure is used for transferring
data between two RLC peer entities, which are operating in
unacknowledged mode. Data is transferred from Sender to Receiver. This
procedure should only apply to RLC entities in DATA\_TRANSFER\_READY
state or LOCAL\_SUSPEND state. Figure 11.2 below illustrates the
elementary procedure for unacknowledged mode data transfer.

Channels that can be used are DTCH, DCCH, CCCH (downlink only), CTCH,
SHCCH (downlink only), MCCH, MSCH, MTCH. The type of logical channel
depends on if the RLC entity is located in the user plane (DTCH, CTCH,
MTCH) or in the control plane (DCCH/CCCH(downlink only)/SHCCH(downlink
only)/MCCH/MSCH). One or several PDUs may be transmitted in each
transmission time interval (TTI). For each TTI, MAC decides which PDU
size shall be used and how many PDUs shall be transmitted.

Figure 11.2: Unacknowledged mode data transfer procedure

### 11.2.2 Transmission of UMD PDU

Upon a request of unacknowledged mode data transfer from upper layer,
the Sender shall:

\- if no SDU discard configuration has been made by upper layers:

\- only discard SDUs when the Transmission buffer is full (see subclause
9.7.3);

\- if \"Timer based SDU Discard without explicit signalling\" is
configured:

\- start a timer Timer\_Discard for each SDU received from upper layer
(see subclause 9.7.3);

\- schedule the RLC SDUs received from upper layer for transmission;

\- if one or more RLC SDUs have been scheduled for transmission:

\- notify the lower layer of reception of data from upper layers;

\- perform the actions specified in subclause 11.2.2.2.

A UMD PDU shall be considered to be a padding PDU if it consists only of
an RLC Header with one length indicator (indicating that the rest of the
PDU is padding) and padding.

#### 11.2.2.1 UMD PDU contents to set

The Sender shall:

\- set the field \"Sequence Number\" equal to VT(US);

\- set a \"Length Indicator\" field for each SDU that ends in the UMD
PDU according to subclause 9.2.2.8.

For each \"Extension bit\" field in the RLC header, the Sender shall:

\- if the next field in the UMD PDU is a \"Length Indicator\":

\- set the \"Extension bit\" to \"1\";

\- otherwise if the next field in the UMD PDU is data:

\- set the \"Extension bit\" to \"0\".

#### 11.2.2.2 Submission of UMD PDUs to the lower layer

If one or more SDUs have been scheduled for transmission according to
subclause 11.2.2, the Sender shall:

\- inform the lower layer of the number and size of SDUs scheduled for
transmission;

\- if \"SN\_Delivery\" is configured:

\- segment, but not concatenate SDUs

\- else:

\- segment, and if possible concatenate the SDUs according to the PDU
sizes indicated by the lower layer (see subclause 9.2.2.9);

\- submit to the lower layer, the requested number of UMD PDUs;

\- update VT(US) for each UMD PDU submitted to the lower layer (see
subclause 9.4);

\- buffer the SDUs that are not submitted to the lower layer according
to the discard configuration (see subclause 9.7.3).

### 11.2.3 Reception of UMD PDU

Upon delivery of a set of UMD PDUs from the lower layer or from the
duplicate avoidance and reordering subentity, the Receiver shall:

> \- if \"out of sequence SDU delivery\" is configured:

\- perform the actions specified in subclause 11.2.3.2;

> \- else:

\- perform the actions specified in subclause 11.2.3.1.

#### 11.2.3.1 SDU discard and re-assembly

Upon delivery of a set of UMD PDUs from the lower layer or from the
duplicate avoidance and reordering subentity, the Receiver shall:

\- if out-of-sequence reception is configured and SN ≥ VR(UM):

\- discard the UMD PDU.

\- else:

\- update VR(US) according to each received UMD PDU (see subclause 9.4);

\- if the updating step of VR(US) is not equal to one (i.e. one or more
UMD PDUs are missing):

\- discard the SDUs that could have segments or \"Length Indicators\"
indicating the end of the SDUs in the missing UMD PDUs according to
subclauses 9.2.2.8 and 9.2.2.9.

\- if the special \"Length Indicator\" \"1111 100\" or \"1111 1111 1111
100\" is the first \"Length Indicator\" of a UMD PDU received on the
downlink:

\- consider the first data octet in this UMD PDU as the first octet of
an RLC SDU.

> \- if the \"Extension bit\" indicates that the UMD PDU contains a
> complete SDU which is not segmented, concatenated or padded:
>
> \- consider the data part in this UMD PDU as one complete RLC SDU.

\- if the special \"Length Indicator\" \"1111 101\" or "1111 1111 1111
101" is the first \"Length Indicator\" of a UMD PDU received on the
downlink:

\- consider the first data octet in this UMD PDU as the first octet of
an RLC SDU and the last data octet as the last octet of the same RLC
SDU.

\- if the special \"Length Indicator\" \"1111 1111 1111 010\" is the
first \"Length Indicator\" of a UMD PDU received on the downlink:

\- consider the first data octet in this UMD PDU as the first octet of
an RLC SDU and the second last data octet as the last octet of the same
RLC SDU.

\- reassemble the received UMD PDUs into RLC SDUs;

\- submit the RLC SDUs to upper layers through the UM-SAP.

#### 11.2.3.2 Out of sequence SDU delivery

To enable the recovery of SDUs from UMD PDUs that are received in
different transmissions the receiving function shall store PDUs until
all SDUs that are associated with the PDU can be reconstructed or until
they are discarded in accordance with the procedures described below.
SDUs are transferred to the upper layers as soon as all PDUs that
contain the segments of the SDU and the \"Length Indicator\" indicating
the end of the SDU have been received.

Upon delivery of a set of UMD PDUs from the lower layer, the Receiver
shall for each PDU (in the following SN denotes the sequence number of
each PDU):

> \- If the PDU is the first PDU received (after the receiving entity is
> established or re-established or after Timer\_OSD expires):
>
> \- VR(UOH) shall be assigned the value SN-1.
>
> \- if VR(UOH) [\>]{.underline} SN \> VR(UOH) -- OSD\_Window\_Size
> then:
>
> \- if a PDU with sequence number SN is already stored:
>
> \- discard the PDU;
>
> \- else:
>
> \- store the PDU in sequence number order.
>
> \- else:
>
> \- VR(UOH) shall be assigned the value SN, thereby advancing the
> storage window;
>

NOTE 0: If PDUs are removed from storage after SDU recovery then
retransmitted PDUs may result in the duplicate transfer of SDUs to the
higher layers.

> \- remove from storage all stored PDUs.

NOTE 1: When configured for out of sequence SDU delivery, the
transmitter should consider the possibility that a loss of a number of
128 − OSD\_Window\_Size consecutively numbered PDUs may result in an
undetected protocol error in the receiver, if the transmit state
variable VT(US), at the end of a time interval equal to the duration of
Timer\_OSD, is greater than 128 + SN − OSD\_Window\_Size + 1, where SN
is the lowest sequence number of any PDU transmitted or retransmitted
within that time interval.

NOTE 2: The transmitter should not concatenate within a single PDU, SDUs
or fractions of SDUs that contain MBMS Access Information messages with
SDUs or fractions of SDUs that contain other MCCH message types.

NOTE 3: SDUs are contained within consecutively numbered PDUs. To enable
SDUs containing MBMS Access Information messages to be transmitted at
their designated times, the transmitter may transmit PDUs out of
sequence order.

NOTE 4: The transmitter should not transmit within a single PDU, SDUs or
fractions of SDUs that contain MBMS Access Information messages with the
special length indicator \"0000 000\",\"0000 0000 0000 000\", and \"1111
1111 1111 011\".

### 11.2.4 Abnormal cases

#### 11.2.4.1 Length Indicator value reserved for UMD PDU

Upon delivery by the lower layer of an UMD PDU that contains a \"Length
Indicator\" value specified to be reserved for UMD PDUs in this version
of the protocol, the Receiver shall:

\- ignore that UMD PDU.

#### 11.2.4.2 Invalid length indicator value

If the \"Length Indicator\" of an UMD PDU has a value that is larger
than the PDU size -- RLC header size and is not one of the predefined
values listed in the table of subclause 9.2.2.8, the Receiver shall:

\- ignore the UMD PDU.

#### 11.2.4.3 SDU discard without explicit signalling

Upon expiry of the timer Timer\_Discard in the Sender, the Sender shall:

\- discard the associated SDU;

\- if requested:

\- inform the upper layers of the discarded SDU;

\- for the first UMD PDU to be transmitted after the discard operation,
the Sender shall:

\- increment VT(US) so that the \"Sequence Number\" field in this UMD
PDU is incremented with two compared with the previous UMD PDU;

\- fill the first data octet in this UMD PDU with the first octet of an
RLC SDU;

\- if the \"Extension bit\" does not indicate that the UMD PDU contains
a complete SDU which is not segmented, concatenated or padded:

\- set the first \"Length Indicator\" in this UMD PDU to indicate that
the previous RLC PDU was exactly filled with the last segment of an RLC
SDU (to avoid that the Receiver unnecessarily discards an extra SDU).

In the case where the TFC selection exchange has been initiated by
sending the RLC Entity Info parameter to MAC, the UE may wait until
after it provides MAC with the requested set of UMD PDUs before
discarding the afore-mentioned SDU.

#### 11.2.4.4 Invalid PDU size

In the UE, if the \"DL RLC UM LI size\" is configured to 7 bits, if a
received UMD PDU has a size larger than 125 octets, the Receiver shall:

\- ignore that UMD PDU.

11.3 Acknowledged mode data transfer procedure
----------------------------------------------

### 11.3.1 General

The acknowledged mode data transfer procedure is used for transferring
data between two RLC peer entities, which are operating in acknowledged
mode. Data is transferred from Sender to Receiver. This procedure should
only apply to RLC entities in DATA\_TRANSFER\_READY state or
LOCAL\_SUSPEND state. Figure 11.3 below illustrates the elementary
procedure for acknowledged mode data transfer.

The AMD PDUs shall be transmitted on the DCCH logical channel if the
Sender is located in the control plane and on the DTCH if it is located
in the user plane. One or several PDUs may be transmitted in each
transmission time interval (TTI) and MAC decides how many PDUs shall be
transmitted in each TTI.

Figure 11.3: Acknowledged mode data transfer procedure

### 11.3.2 Transmission of AMD PDU

Upon a request of acknowledged mode data transfer from upper layers or
upon retransmission of AMD PDUs, the Sender shall:

\- when RLC SDUs are received from upper layers:

\- if \"fixed RLC PDU size\" has been configured:

\- segment, and if possible concatenate the RLC SDUs into AMD PDUs where
the fixed PDU size is configured by upper layer (see subclause 9.2.2.9);

\- if the last octet of the PDU is the last octet of an SDU and there is
no SDU concatenation inside the PDU, and the "use of the special value
of the HE field" has been configured by higher layers, set the HE field
to indicate that the last octet of the PDU is the last octet of an SDU
(see subclause 9.2.2.7).

\- if \"flexible RLC PDU size\" has been configured:

\- the last segment of an RLC SDU shall be concatenated with the first
segment of the next RLC SDU in order to fill the data field at least up
to the Minimum UL RLC PDU size. If data to be transmitted is not enough
to create an AMD PDU of the minimum size, it is allowed to create an AMD
PDU including all data to be transmitted, even if the resulting size is
smaller than the Minimum UL RLC PDU size.

\- set a \"Length Indicator\" field for each SDU that ends in the AMD
PDU according to subclause 9.2.2.8, except for the SDUs where the end of
the SDU has been indicated by the HE field according to subclause
9.2.2.7;

\- if \"Timer based SDU Discard with explicit signalling\" is
configured:

\- start a timer Timer\_Discard for each SDU received from upper layer
(see subclause 9.7.3);

\- schedule the AMD PDUs for transmission;

\- for each AMD PDU which has been negatively acknowledged (see
subclause 11.5.3):

\- if the \"Sequence Number\" of the AMD PDU is less than VT(MS):

\- schedule the AMD PDU for retransmission;

\- if a poll has been triggered by one of configured polling functions
(see subclause 9.7.1); and

\- if polling is not prohibited (see subclause 9.5); and

\- if no AMD PDU is scheduled for transmission or retransmission; and

\- if there is at least one PDU that has been transmitted, has not been
discarded and has not yet been acknowledged:

\- if the value of \"Configured\_Tx\_Window\_Size\" is larger than or
equal to \"2048\":

\- select the AMD PDU with \"Sequence Number\" equal to VT(S)-1; or

\- assemble a POLL SUFI according to subclause 9.2.2.11.9 when
\"flexible RLC PDU size\" is configured;

\- otherwise if the \"Configured\_Tx\_Window\_Size\" is less than
\"2048\":

> \- select the AMD PDU with \"Sequence Number\" equal to VT(S)-1; or
>
> \- select an AMD PDU that has not been discarded and has not yet been
> acknowledged by the peer entity; or
>
> \- assemble a POLL SUFI according to subclause 9.2.2.11.9 when
> "flexible RLC PDU size" is configured;

\- if an AMD PDU was selected, schedule the selected AMD PDU for
retransmission (in order to transmit a poll), or if a POLL SUFI was
assembled, schedule a STATUS PDU containing the POLL SUFI for
transmission:

\- if the timer Timer\_Poll is configured:

\- start the timer Timer\_Poll according to subclause 9.5.

NOTE 1: In downlink, if \"flexible RLC PDU size\" is configured, the
UTRAN should segment, and if possible concatenate the RLC SDUs into AMD
PDUs with a size not larger than the maximum RLC PDU size.

NOTE 2: In downlink, UTRAN can initiate the Polling function by
assembling a POLL SUFI when \"flexible RLC PDU size\" in downlink is
configured. If a POLL SUFI was assembled, UTRAN should schedule and
submit to lower layer a STATUS PDU containing the POLL SUFI.

NOTE 3: In uplink, the UE can initiate the Polling function by
assembling a POLL SUFI according to subclause 9.2.2.11.9 when \"flexible
RLC PDU size\" in uplink is configured. If a POLL SUFI was assembled,
the UE should schedule and submit to lower layer a STATUS PDU containing
the POLL SUFI.

Each time an AMD PDU is scheduled for transmission or retransmission,
the Sender shall:

> \- increment the value of the corresponding VT(DAT);
>
> \- if VT(DAT) = MaxDAT:

\- perform the actions specified in subclause 11.3.3a;

> \- e1se:

\- notify the lower layer that data is available for transmission;

\- perform the actions specified in subclause 11.3.2.2.

In AM, a PDU shall be considered to be a padding PDU if it is:

\- an AMD PDU consisting only of an RLC Header with one \"Length
Indicator\" (indicating that the rest of the PDU is padding) and
padding; or

\- a STATUS PDU consisting only of a NO\_MORE SUFI.

#### 11.3.2.1 AMD PDU contents to set

If the AMD PDU is transmitted for the first time, the Sender shall:

\- set the \"Sequence Number\" field equal to VT(S);

\- if the last octet of the PDU is the last octet of an SDU and there is
no SDU concatenation inside the PDU, and the use of the special value of
HE field has been configured by higher layers, set the HE field to
indicate that the last octet of the PDU is the last octet of an SDU (see
subclause 9.2.2.7)

\- set a \"Length Indicator\" field for each SDU that ends in the AMD
PDU according to subclause 9.2.2.8, except for the SDUs where the end of
the SDU has been indicated by the HE field according to subclause
9.2.2.7;

\- set the \"Polling bit\" to the value specified in subclause
11.3.2.1.1.

Otherwise if the AMD PDU is retransmitted:

\- use the same value of the \"Sequence Number\" field as in the
original transmission of the AMD PDU;

\- if the \"Length Indicator\" fields needed in the AMD PDU according to
subclause 9.2.2.8 has changed due to that a piggybacked STATUS PDU is
included in the AMD PDU or a piggybacked STATUS PDU was included in the
previous transmission of the AMD PDU:

\- update the \"Length Indicator\" fields according to 9.2.2.8.

\- set the \"Polling bit\" to the value specified in subclause
11.3.2.1.1.

##### 11.3.2.1.1 Setting of the Polling bit

The Sender shall:

\- if a poll has been triggered by one or several poll triggers (see
subclause 9.7.1):

\- if polling is not prohibited, see subclause 9.5:

\- set the \"Polling bit\" in the AMD PDU header to \"1\";

\- otherwise:

\- set the \"Polling bit\" in the AMD PDU header to \"0\".

##### 11.3.2.1.2 Void

#### 11.3.2.2 Submission of AMD PDUs to lower layer

If one or more AMD PDUs have been scheduled for transmission or
retransmission according to subclause 11.3.2, the Sender shall:

\- not submit any AMD PDUs to lower layer that is not allowed to
transmit. AMD PDUs are only allowed to transmit:

\- if the AMD PDU has a \"Sequence Number\" \< VT(MS) or the AMD PDU has
a \"Sequence Number\" equal to VT(S)-1; and

\- if the AMD PDU is not restricted to be transmitted by the local
suspend function, see subclause 9.7.5.

\- inform the lower layer of both the numbers of AMD PDUs scheduled and
allowed for transmission or retransmission;

\- set the AMD PDU contents according to subclause 11.3.2.1;

\- submit to the lower layer the requested number of AMD PDUs;

\- treat retransmissions with higher priority than AMD PDUs transmitted
for the first time;

\- update the state variables in clause 9.4 for each AMD PDU submitted
to lower layer except VT(DAT) which has already been updated, see
subclause 11.3.2;

\- if the \"Polling bit\" is set to \"1\" in any of the AMD PDUs; and

\- if the timer Timer\_Poll is configured;

\- start the timer Timer\_Poll according to subclause 9.5;

\- buffer the AMD PDUs that are not submitted to the lower layer
according to the discard configuration (see subclause 9.7.3).

### 11.3.3 Reception of AMD PDU by the Receiver

Upon reception of an AMD PDU, the Receiver shall:

\- in the UE if \"fixed RLC PDU size\" has been configured:

\- if the \"downlink AMD PDU size\" has not yet been set:

\- set the \"downlink AMD PDU size\" to the size of the received PDU.

\- update VR(R), VR(H) and VR(MR) state variables for each received AMD
PDU (see clause 9.4);

\- if Timer\_Reordering is configured:

\- if a received AMD PDU SN = VR(MS)

\- update VR(MS) to SN of the first AMD PDU that has not been received;

\- if Timer\_Reordering is running:

\- if VR(X) = VR(R); or

\- if VR(X) falls outside of the receiving window and VR(X) is not equal
to VR(MR):

\- stop and reset Timer\_Reordering;

\- if Timer\_Reordering is not running (includes the case
Timer\_Reordering is stopped due to actions above):

\- if VR (H) \> VR(R):

\- start Timer\_Reordering;

\- set VR(X) to VR(H).

\- if a received AMD PDU includes a \"Polling bit\" set to \"1\", or
\"Missing PDU Indicator\" is configured and the Receiver detects that a
PDU is missing:

\- initiate the STATUS PDU transfer procedure;

\- reassemble the received AMD PDUs into RLC SDUs;

\- if \"In-Sequence Delivery\" is configured:

\- deliver the RLC SDUs in-sequence (i.e. in the same order as the RLC
SDUs were originally transmitted by the peer entity) to upper layers
through the AM-SAP.

\- otherwise:

\- deliver the RLC SDUs in arbitrary order to upper layers through the
AM-SAP.

### 11.3.3a Reached maximum number of attempts

If VT(DAT) = MaxDAT, the Sender shall:

\- if \"No\_discard after MaxDAT number of transmissions\" is
configured:

\- initiate the RLC reset procedure, see subclause 11.4.

\- if \"SDU discard after MaxDAT number of transmissions\" is
configured:

\- initiate the \"SDU discard with explicit signalling\" procedure for
the corresponding SDU, see subclause 11.6.

### 11.3.4 Abnormal cases

#### 11.3.4.1 Void

#### 11.3.4.2 Receiving an AMD PDU outside the reception window

Upon reception of an AMD PDU with \"Sequence Number\" outside the
interval VR(R)≤SN\<VR(MR), the Receiver shall:

\- discard the AMD PDU;

\- if the \"polling bit\" in the discarded AMD PDU is set to \"1\":

\- initiate the STATUS PDU transfer procedure.

#### 11.3.4.3 Timer\_Discard timeout

##### 11.3.4.3.1 SDU discard with explicit signalling

Upon expiry of the timer Timer\_Discard, the Sender shall:

\- initiate the SDU discard with explicit signalling procedure, see
subclause 11.6.2.

In the case where the TFC selection exchange has been initiated by
sending the RLC Entity Info parameter to MAC, the UE may wait until
after it provides MAC with the requested set of PDUs before discarding
the afore-mentioned SDUs.

#### 11.3.4.4 Void

#### 11.3.4.5 Invalid length indicator value

If the \"Length Indicator\" of an AMD PDU has a value that is larger
than the PDU size -- RLC header size and is not one of the predefined
values listed in the table of subclause 9.2.2.8, the Receiver shall:

\- ignore that AMD PDU.

#### 11.3.4.6 Length Indicator value reserved for AMD PDU

Upon delivery by the lower layer of an AMD PDU that contains a \"Length
Indicator\" value specified to be reserved for AMD PDUs in this version
of the protocol, the Receiver shall:

\- ignore that AMD PDU.

#### 11.3.4.7 Void

#### 11.3.4.8 Receiving an AMD PDU within the reception window more than once (Handling of Duplicates)

Upon reception of an AMD PDU with a "Sequence Number" within the
interval VR(R)≤SN\<VR(MR), for which \"Sequence Number\" an AMD PDU has
already been received, the Receiver shall:

\- discard the AMD PDU;

\- consider the AMD PDU with this \"Sequence Number\" as having been
correctly received in the next status report to be transmitted;

\- - if the \"polling bit\" in the discarded AMD PDU is set to \"1\":

\- initiate the STATUS PDU transfer procedure.

\- if a piggybacked STATUS PDU is included in the AMD PDU:

\- perform the actions specified in subclause 11.5.3.

#### 11.3.4.9 Full Buffer Behavior

It is foreseen that in some conditions, e.g. when the window size is
re-configured, the UE may have memory limitations.

While the buffer memory is full:

\- the UE is not required to segment RLC SDUs into AMD PDUs as per
Subclause 11.3.2;

\- the UE shall:

\- be able to process incoming AMD PDUs (especially to be able to
process and store the AMD PDU with \"Sequence Number\" = VR(R));

\- operate according to the normal protocol, e.g. process STATUS reports
and perform retransmissions;

\- the UE may discard received AMD PDUs with \"Sequence Number\" within
the receiving window and consider the discarded AMD PDUs as not having
been received.

#### 11.3.4.10 Invalid PDU size

In the UE, if \"fixed RLC PDU size\" has been configured and if a
received AMD PDU has a size different from the configured \"downlink AMD
PDU size\", the Receiver shall:

\- ignore that AMD PDU.

### 11.3.5 Transmission of POLL SUFI

Each time a STATUS PDU containing the POLL SUFI is scheduled for
transmission, the Sender shall:

\- increment the value of the corresponding VT(DAT) of the AMD PDU with
sequence number equal to VT(S)-1;

\- if VT(DAT) = MaxDAT:

\- perform the actions specified in subclause 11.3.3a;

\- e1se:

\- notify the lower layer that STATUS PDU is available for transmission.

11.4 RLC reset procedure
------------------------

### 11.4.1 General

The RLC reset procedure is used to reset two RLC peer entities, which
are operating in acknowledged mode. Figure 11.4 below illustrates the
elementary procedure for an RLC reset. During the reset procedure the
hyper frame numbers (HFN) in UTRAN and UE are synchronised. Two HFNs
used for ciphering needs to be synchronised, DL HFN in downlink and UL
HFN in uplink. In the reset procedure, the highest UL HFN and DL HFN
used by the RLC entity in the transmitting sides, i.e. the HFNs
associated with AMD PDUs of \"Sequence Number\"=VT(S)-1 if at least one
AMD PDU had been transmitted or of \"Sequence Number\"=0 if no AMD PDU
had been transmitted, are exchanged between UE and UTRAN.

The RESET PDUs and the RESET ACK PDUs have higher priority than AMD
PDUs.

Figure 11.4: RLC reset procedure

### 11.4.2 Initiation

The Sender shall:

\- if one of the following triggers is detected:

1\) \"No\_Discard after MaxDAT number of transmissions\" is configured
and VT(DAT) equals the value MaxDAT (see subclause 9.7.3.4);

2\) VT(MRW) equals the value MaxMRW;

3\) A STATUS PDU or a piggybacked STATUS PDU including \"erroneous
Sequence Number\" is received (see clause 10);

\- stop transmitting any AMD PDU or STATUS PDU;

\- ignore any incoming AMD PDU, piggybacked STATUS PDU or STATUS PDU;

\- increment VT(RST) by 1;

\- if VT(RST) = MaxRST:

\- perform the actions specified in subclause 11.4.4a.

\- else (if VT(RST) \< MaxRST):

\- submit a RESET PDU to the lower layer;

\- start the timer Timer\_RST according to the description in subclause
9.5.

NOTE: If the TFC selection exchange has been initiated by sending the
RLC Entity Info parameter to MAC, the RLC entity may delay the RLC reset
procedure until the end of the next TTI.

When a reset procedure has been initiated it can only be ended upon
reception of a RESET ACK PDU with the same RSN value as in the
corresponding RESET PDU, upon request of re-establishment due to request
of re-establishment (for the whole RLC entity or for only the
transmitting or receiving side of the RLC entity), or release from upper
layer. A reset procedure is not interrupted by the reception of a RESET
PDU from the peer entity.

#### 11.4.2.1 RESET PDU contents to set

The Sender shall:

\- set the HFNI field to the currently highest used HFN (DL HFN when the
RESET PDU is sent by UTRAN or UL HFN when the RESET PDU is sent by the
UE);

\- set the RSN field to the sequence number of the RESET PDU. The
sequence number of the first RESET PDU after the AM entity is
established or re-established (for the whole RLC entity or for only the
transmitting or receiving side of the RLC entity) shall be \"0\". This
sequence number is incremented every time a new RESET PDU is
transmitted, but not when a RESET PDU is retransmitted.

### 11.4.3 Reception of the RESET PDU by the Receiver

Upon reception of a RESET PDU the Receiver shall:

\- if the RESET PDU is not the first RESET PDU received since the entity
was established or re-established; and

\- if the RSN value in the RESET PDU is the same as the RSN value in the
last received RESET PDU:

\- only submit a RESET ACK PDU to the lower layer with the contents set
exactly as in the last transmitted RESET ACK PDU (i.e., in this case the
RLC entity is not reset).

\- if the RESET PDU is the first RESET PDU received since the entity was
established or re-established; or

\- if the RSN value is different from the RSN value in the last received
RESET PDU:

\- submit a RESET ACK PDU to the lower layer with the content set as
specified in subclause 11.4.3.1;

\- reset the state variables described in subclause 9.4 except VT(RST)
to their initial values;

\- stop all the timers described in subclause 9.5 except Timer\_RST,
Timer\_Discard, Timer\_Poll\_Periodic and Timer\_Status\_Periodic;

\- reset configurable parameters to their configured values;

\- discard all RLC PDUs in the receiving side of the AM RLC entity;

\- discard all RLC SDUs that were transmitted before the reset in the
transmitting side of the AM RLC entity;

\- if requested for the transmitting side:

\- inform the upper layers of the discarded SDUs.

\- set the HFN (DL HFN when the RESET PDU is received in UE or UL HFN
when the RESET PDU is received in UTRAN) equal to the HFNI field in the
received RESET PDU;

\- increase with one the UL HFN and DL HFN, and the updated HFN values
shall be used for the first transmitted and received AMD PDUs after the
reset procedure.

NOTE: If the TFC selection exchange has been initiated by sending the
RLC Entity Info parameter to MAC, the RLC entity may delay the RLC SDUs
discard in the transmitting side of the AM RLC entity until the end of
the next TTI.

#### 11.4.3.1 RESET ACK PDU contents to set

The RLC entity shall:

\- set the hyper frame number indicator field (HFNI) to the currently
highest used HFN (DL HFN when the RESET ACK PDU is sent by UTRAN or UL
HFN when the RESET ACK PDU is sent by the UE);

\- set the RSN field to the same value as in the corresponding received
RESET PDU.

### 11.4.4 Reception of the RESET ACK PDU by the Sender

Upon reception of a RESET ACK PDU, the Sender shall:

\- if the Sender has already transmitted a RESET PDU which has not been
yet acknowledged by a RESET ACK PDU:

\- if the received RSN value is the same as the one in the corresponding
RESET PDU:

\- set the HFN value (DL HFN when the RESET ACK PDU is received in UE or
UL HFN when the RESET ACK PDU is received in UTRAN) to the HFNI field of
the received RESET ACK PDU;

\- reset the state variables described in subclause 9.4 to their initial
values;

\- stop all the timers described in subclause 9.5 except Timer\_Discard,
Timer\_Poll\_Periodic and Timer\_Status\_Periodic;

\- reset configurable parameters to their configured values;

\- discard all RLC PDUs in the receiving side of the AM RLC entity;

\- discard all RLC SDUs that were transmitted before the reset in the
transmitting side of the AM RLC entity;

\- if requested for the transmitting side:

\- inform the upper layers of the discarded SDUs.

\- increase with one the UL HFN and DL HFN, and the updated HFN values
shall be used for the first transmitted and received AMD PDUs after the
reset procedure;

\- otherwise (if the received RSN value is not the same as the one in
the corresponding RESET PDU):

\- discard the RESET ACK PDU;

\- otherwise (if the Sender has not transmitted a RESET PDU which has
not been yet acknowledged by a RESET ACK PDU):

\- discard the RESET ACK PDU.

NOTE: If the TFC selection exchange has been initiated by sending the
RLC Entity Info parameter to MAC, the RLC entity may delay the RLC SDUs
discard in the transmitting side until the end of the next TTI.

### 11.4.4a Reached maximum number of attempts

If VT(RST) = MaxRST, the Sender shall:

\- terminate the ongoing RLC RESET procedure;

\- stop the timer Timer\_RST if it was started;

\- indicate unrecoverable error to upper layer.

### 11.4.5 Abnormal cases

#### 11.4.5.1 Timer\_RST timeout

If Timer\_RST expires before the reset procedure is terminated, the
Sender shall:

\- increment VT(RST) by one;

\- if VT(RST)\<MaxRST:

\- set the RESET PDU as previously transmitted;

\- transmit the RESET PDU;

\- restart Timer\_RST according to the description in subclause 9.5.

\- else (if VT(RST) = MaxRST):

> \- perform the actions specified in subclause 11.4.4a.

#### 11.4.5.2 Void

#### 11.4.5.3 Reception of the RESET PDU by the Sender

Upon reception of a RESET PDU, the Sender shall:

\- submit a RESET ACK PDU to the lower layer with the content set as
specified in subclause 11.4.3.1;

\- reset the state variables described in subclause 9.4 except VT(RST)
to their initial values;

\- stop all the timers described in subclause 9.5 except Timer\_RST,
Timer\_Discard, Timer\_Poll\_Periodic and Timer\_Status\_Periodic;

\- reset configurable parameters to their configured values;

\- discard all RLC PDUs in the receiving side of the AM RLC entity;

\- discard all RLC SDUs that were transmitted before the reset in the
transmitting side of the AM RLC entity;

\- if requested for the transmitting side:

\- inform the upper layers of the discarded SDUs.

\- set the HFN (DL HFN when the RESET PDU is received in UE or UL HFN
when the RESET PDU is received in UTRAN) equal to the HFNI field in the
received RESET PDU.

NOTE: If the TFC selection exchange has been initiated by sending the
RLC Entity Info parameter to MAC, the RLC entity may delay the RLC SDUs
discard in the transmitting side until the end of the next TTI.

11.5 STATUS report transfer procedure
-------------------------------------

### 11.5.1 General

The status report transfer procedure is used for transferring of status
information between two RLC peer entities, which are operating in
acknowledged mode. Figure 11.5 below illustrates the elementary
procedure for status report transfer. A status report consists of one or
several STATUS PDUs.

In case two logical channels are configured in the uplink, only
acknowledgement status reports, MRW ACK SUFI and WINDOW SUFI shall be
transmitted on the second logical channel. In case two logical channels
are configured in the downlink, control PDUs can be transmitted on any
of the two logical channels.

The STATUS PDUs have higher priority than AMD PDUs.

Figure 11.5: Status report transfer procedure

### 11.5.2 Initiation

The Receiver shall:

\- if one of the following triggers is detected:

1\) The \"Polling bit\" in a received AMD PDU is set to \"1\";

2\) \"Missing PDU Indicator\" is configured and a missing AMD PDU is
detected;

3\) The \"Timer based STATUS transfer\" is configured and the timer
Timer\_Status\_Periodic has expired:

\- act on the trigger as specified in subclause 9.7.2.

4\) Void

5\) If the flexible RLC PDU size is configured and POLL SUFI is
received:

\- consider that Poll\_SN has been transmitted by the sender as
specified in subclause 9.4:

\- act on the trigger as specified in subclause 9.7.2.

#### 11.5.2.1 Piggybacked STATUS PDU

The Receiver may:

\- if STATUS PDU(s) to be sent fit into padding octets in AMD PDU(s) to
be sent:

\- piggyback a STATUS PDU on the AMD PDU to be sent.

Submission of a piggybacked STATUS PDU in an AMD PDU to the lower layer
follows the same rules as an ordinary STATUS PDU.

#### 11.5.2.2 STATUS PDU contents to set

On triggering of a status report, the Receiver shall:

\- if the \"STATUS prohibit\" is not active:

\- If Timer\_Reordering is not configured:

\- include negative acknowledgements for all AMD PDUs detected as
missing;

\- include an ACK SUFI positively acknowledging all AMD PDUs received up
to at least VR(R);

\- If Timer\_Reordering is configured, for all SN such that VR(R) \<= SN
\< VR(MS):

\- include negative acknowledgements for all AMD PDUs detected as
missing;

\- include an ACK SUFI positively acknowledging all AMD PDUs received up
to at least VR(R);

\- if an MRW SUFI assembled as specified in subclause 11.6.2.2 had not
been sent:

\- optionally include the MRW SUFI;

\- if an MRW\_ACK SUFI assembled as specified in subclause 11.6.2.2 is
awaiting transmission:

\- optionally include the MRW\_ACK SUFI;

\- if the Sender\'s transmission window is to be updated:

\- optionally include the WINDOW SUFI;

\- if all SUFIs can be accommodated in one STATUS PDU:

\- construct the status report using one STATUS PDU, using one of the
allowed PDU sizes;

\- if the SUFIs included do not fill the entire STATUS PDU:

\- if the STATUS PDU is not terminated with an ACK SUFI:

\- terminate the STATUS PDU with a NO\_MORE SUFI.

\- use padding in the remainder of the STATUS PDU (padding size may be
zero);

\- otherwise (the status report is segmented):

\- construct STATUS PDUs including only complete SUFIs using one of the
allowed PDU sizes. The set of STATUS PDUs shall accommodate all the
SUFIs to form the complete status report. Indication of the same AMD PDU
shall not be given in more than one STATUS PDU of a status report, but
the ACK SUFI can be present in more than one STATUS PDU of a status
report;

\- if any STATUS PDU constructed is not entirely filled with SUFIs:

\- if the STATUS PDU is not terminated with an ACK SUFI:

\- terminate that STATUS PDU with a NO\_MORE SUFI.

\- use padding in the remainder of that STATUS PDU (padding size may be
zero).

Which SUFI fields to use is implementation dependent. Bitmap SUFI is
used to indicate both received and/or missing AMD PDUs. List SUFI and/or
Relative List SUFI are used to indicate missing AMD PDUs only.
Acknowledgement SUFI is used to indicate the received AMD PDUs. (For
SUFI details see 9.2.2.11.)

#### 11.5.2.3 Submission of STATUS PDUs to the lower layer

The Receiver shall:

\- inform the lower layer of the STATUS PDUs scheduled for transmission;

\- submit to the lower layer, the requested number of PDUs (STATUS PDUs,
piggybacked AMD/STATUS PDUs and optionally AMD PDUs, see also subclause
11.3.2.2);

\- if \"Timer based STATUS transfer\" is configured and the timer
Timer\_Status\_Periodic has expired:

\- restart the timer Timer\_Status\_Periodic according to subclause 9.5
f);

\- if the STATUS PDU includes the MRW SUFI:

\- start the timer Timer\_MRW according to subclause 9.5 i).

### 11.5.3 Reception of the STATUS PDU by the Sender

Upon reception of the STATUS PDU/piggybacked STATUS PDU, the Sender
shall:

\- if an RLC SDU is positively acknowledged by the STATUS PDU:

\- if requested:

\- inform the upper layers of the reception of the RLC SDU by the peer
AM RLC entity.

\- update the state variables VT(A) and VT(MS) according to the received
STATUS PDU/piggybacked STATUS PDU;

\- if the STATUS PDU includes negatively acknowledged AMD PDUs:

\- initiate the acknowledged data transfer procedure; and

\- retransmit these AMD PDUs. Retransmitted AMD PDUs shall have higher
priority than AMD PDUs to be transmitted for the first time;

\- if an AMD PDU is negatively acknowledged more than once in a STATUS
PDU:

\- retransmit the AMD PDU only once.

\- if the STATUS PDU includes the MRW SUFI:

\- take the actions specified in subclause 11.6.3.

\- if the STATUS PDU includes the MRW\_ACK SUFI:

\- take the actions specified in subclause 11.6.4.

\- if the STATUS PDU includes the WINDOW SUFI:

\- update the current transmission window size, VT(WS).

11.6 SDU discard with explicit signalling procedure
---------------------------------------------------

### 11.6.1 General

The SDU discard with explicit signalling procedure is used for
discarding SDUs and transferring the discard information between two
peer entities, which are operating in acknowledged mode. The Sender
shall discard an SDU that has not been successfully transmitted for a
period of time or for a number of transmissions, and send a Move
Receiving Window (MRW) SUFI to the Receiver. According to the MRW SUFI,
the Receiver shall discard AMD PDUs carrying that SDU and update the
reception window. Figure 11.6 below illustrates the elementary procedure
for SDU discard with explicit signalling.

Figure 11.6: SDU discard with explicit signalling

### 11.6.2 Initiation

The Sender shall initiate the SDU discard with explicit signalling
procedure if one of the following triggers is detected:

\- \"Timer based SDU discard with explicit signalling\" is configured,
Timer\_Discard expires for an SDU, and one or more segments of the SDU
have been submitted to lower layer;

\- \"Timer based SDU discard with explicit signalling\" is configured,
Timer\_Discard expires for an SDU, and \"Send MRW\" is configured;

\- \"SDU discard after MaxDAT number of transmissions\" is configured,
and MaxDAT number of transmissions is reached (i.e. VT(DAT) ≥ MaxDAT)
for an AMD PDU.

Upon initiation of the SDU discard with explicit signalling procedure,
the Sender shall:

\- if \"Timer based SDU discard with explicit signalling\" is
configured:

\- discard all SDUs up to and including the SDU for which the timer
Timer\_Discard expired.

\- if \"SDU discard after MaxDAT number of transmissions\" is
configured:

\- discard all SDUs that have segments or \"Length Indicators\"
indicating the end of the SDUs in AMD PDUs with \"Sequence Number\" SN
inside the interval VT(A) ≤ SN ≤ X, where X is the value of the
\"Sequence Number\" of the AMD PDU with VT(DAT) ≥ MaxDAT.

\- if requested:

\- inform the upper layers of the discarded SDUs

\- discard all AMD PDUs including segments of the discarded SDUs or
\"Length Indicators\" indicating the end of the SDUs, unless they also
carry a segment of a SDU which is not discarded;

\- if more than 15 discarded SDUs are to be informed to the Receiver
(see subclause 11.6.2.2):

\- if \"Send MRW\" is not configured:

\- assemble an MRW SUFI with the discard information of the SDUs.

\- otherwise (\"Send MRW\" is configured):

\- assemble an MRW SUFI with the discard information of the first 15
SDUs; and

\- include the discard information of the rest SDUs in another MRW SUFI
which shall be sent by the next SDU discard with explicit signalling
procedure (after the current SDU discard with explicit signalling
procedure is terminated).

\- otherwise (less than or equal to 15 discarded SDUs are to be informed
to the Receiver):

\- assemble an MRW SUFI with the discard information of the SDUs.

\- schedule and submit to lower layer a STATUS PDU/piggybacked STATUS
PDU containing the MRW SUFI;

\- if SN\_MRW~LENGTH~ in the MRW SUFI \>VT(S):

\- update VT(S) to SN\_MRW~LENGTH~.

\- start a timer Timer\_MRW according to subclause 9.5.

If a new SDU discard with explicit signalling procedure is triggered
when the current SDU discard with explicit signalling procedure is still
going on, no new MRW SUFIs shall be sent before the current SDU discard
with explicit signalling procedure is terminated by one of the
termination criteria specified in subclause 11.6.4.

#### 11.6.2.1 Void

#### 11.6.2.2 STATUS PDU contents to set

The Sender shall:

\- if \"Send MRW\" is configured:

\- if no new SDU is present inside the AMD PDU which contains the
\"Length Indicator\" of the last discarded SDU or if the AMD PDU
contains the special value of the HE field to indicate the end of the
last discarded SDU:

\- set the last SN\_MRW~i~ field in the MRW SUFI to 1 + \"Sequence
Number\" of the AMD PDU which contains the \"Length Indicator\" of the
last discarded SDU or the special value of the HE field to indicate the
end of the last discarded SDU;

\- set the N~LENGTH~ field in the MRW SUFI to \"0000\".

\- otherwise:

\- set the last SN\_MRW~i~ field in the MRW SUFI to the \"Sequence
Number\" of the AMD PDU which contains the \"Length Indicator\" of the
last discarded SDU;

\- set the N~LENGTH~ field in the MRW SUFI so that the last data octet
to be discarded in the Receiver shall be the octet indicated by the
N~LENGTH~:th \"Length Indicator\" field of the AMD PDU which contains
the \"Length Indicator\" of the last discarded SDU;

\- set each of the other SN\_MRW~i~ fields in the MRW SUFI to the
\"Sequence Number\" of the AMD PDU which contains the \"Length
Indicator\" of the i:th discarded SDU or the special value of the HE
field to indicate the end of the i:th discarded SDU.

\- otherwise (\"Send MRW\" is not configured):

\- if no new SDU is present inside the AMD PDU which contains the
\"Length Indicator\" of the last discarded SDU or if the AMD PDU
contains the special value of the HE field to indicate the end of the
last discarded SDU:

\- set the last SN\_MRW~i~ field in the MRW SUFI to 1 + \"Sequence
Number\" of the AMD PDU which contains the \"Length Indicator\" of the
last SDU to be discarded in the Receiver or the special value of the HE
field to indicate the end of the last discarded SDU;

\- set the N~LENGTH~ field in the MRW SUFI to \"0000\".

\- otherwise:

\- set the last SN\_MRW~i~ field in the MRW SUFI to the \"Sequence
Number\" of the AMD PDU which contains the \"Length Indicator\" of the
last SDU to be discarded in the Receiver;

\- set the N~LENGTH~ field in the MRW SUFI so that the last data octet
to be discarded in the Receiver shall be the octet indicated by the
N~LENGTH~:th \"Length Indicator\" field of the AMD PDU which contains
the \"Length Indicator\" of the last SDU to be discarded in the
Receiver;

\- optionally set each of the other SN\_MRW~i~ fields in the MRW SUFI to
the \"Sequence Number\" of the AMD PDU which contains the \"Length
Indicator\" or the special value of the HE field to indicate the end of
the i:th SDU to be discarded in the Receiver;

\- if the MRW SUFI contains only one SN\_MRW~i~ field and the value of
SN\_MRW~i~ field ≥ VT(A)+Configured\_Tx\_Window\_Size:

\- set the LENGTH field in the MRW SUFI to \"0000\".

\- otherwise:

\- set the LENGTH field in the MRW SUFI to the number of SN\_MRW~i~
fields in the same MRW SUFI. In this case, SN\_MRW~1~ shall be in the
interval VT(A) ≤ SN\_MRW~1~ \< VT(A)+Configured\_Tx\_Window\_Size.

### 11.6.3 Reception of the STATUS PDU by the Receiver

Upon reception of the STATUS PDU/piggybacked STATUS PDU containing an
MRW SUFI, the Receiver shall:

\- if the LENGTH field in the received MRW SUFI is \"0000\":

\- consider SN\_MRW~1~ to be above or equal to VR(R).

\- otherwise:

\- consider SN\_MRW~1~ to be less than VR(MR);

\- consider all the SN\_MRW~i~s other than SN\_MRW~1~ to be in
sequential order within the list and sequentially above or equal to
SN\_MRW~i-1~;

\- deliver all the successfully received SDUs from the SDU that have
segments or \"Length Indicators\" indicating the end of the SDUs in AMD
PDU with \"Sequence Number\" of VR(R) up to and including the last SDU
that is indicated by the MRW SUFI;

\- discard AMD PDUs up to and including the PDU with sequence number
SN\_MRW~LENGTH~--1;

\- if the N~LENGTH~ field in the received MRW SUFI is \"0000\":

\- reassemble from the first data octet of the AMD PDU with sequence
number SN\_MRW~LENGTH~ after the discard.

\- otherwise:

\- discard further the data octets in the AMD PDU with sequence number
SN\_MRW~LENGTH~ up to and including the octet indicated by the
N~LENGTH~:th \"Length Indicator\" field of the PDU with sequence number
SN\_MRW~LENGTH~;

\- reassemble from the succeeding data octet in the AMD PDU with
sequence number SN\_MRW~LENGTH~ after the discard;

\- if \"Send MRW\" is configured:

\- inform upper layers about all of the discarded SDUs that were not
previously delivered to upper layer or discarded by other MRW SUFIs;

\- update the state variables VR(R), VR(H) and VR(MR) according to the
received STATUS PDU/piggybacked STATUS PDU;

\- assemble a MRW\_ACK SUFI according to subclause 11.6.3.1;

\- schedule and submit to lower layer a STATUS PDU/piggybacked STATUS
PDU containing the MRW\_ACK SUFI.

#### 11.6.3.1 STATUS PDU contents to set

The Receiver shall:

\- set the SN\_ACK field in the MRW\_ACK SUFI to the new value of VR(R),
updated after reception of the MRW SUFI;

\- if the SN\_ACK field in the MRW\_ACK SUFI is set equal to the
SN\_MRW~LENGTH~ field in the received MRW SUFI:

\- set the N field in the MRW\_ACK SUFI to the N~LENGTH~ field in the
received MRW SUFI.

\- otherwise:

\- set the N field in the MRW\_ACK SUFI to \"0000\".

\- include the MRW\_ACK SUFI in the next STATUS PDU/piggybacked STATUS
PDU to be transmitted, according to subclause 11.5.2.

### 11.6.4 Termination

The Sender shall terminate the SDU discard with explicit signalling
procedure if one of the following criteria is fulfilled:

\- a STATUS PDU/piggybacked STATUS PDU containing an MRW\_ACK SUFI is
received, and the SN\_ACK field in the received MRW\_ACK SUFI \> the
SN\_MRW~LENGTH~ field in the transmitted MRW\_SUFI, and the N field in
the received MRW\_ACK SUFI is set equal to \"0000\";

\- a STATUS PDU/piggybacked STATUS PDU containing an MRW\_ACK SUFI is
received, and the SN\_ACK field in the received MRW\_ACK SUFI = the
SN\_MRW~LENGTH~ field in the transmitted MRW\_SUFI, and the N field in
the received MRW\_ACK SUFI is set equal to the N~LENGTH~ field in the
transmitted MRW SUFI;

\- a STATUS PDU/piggybacked STATUS PDU containing an ACK SUFI is
received, and this STATUS PDU/piggybacked STATUS PDU indicates that all
AMD PDUs up to and including the AMD PDU with \"Sequence Number\" equal
to (SN\_MRW~LENGTH~ field in the transmitted MRW SUFI) -- 1 has been
received or discarded by the peer entity.

Upon termination of the SDU discard with explicit signalling procedure,
the Sender shall:

\- stop the timer Timer\_MRW;

\- update VT(A) and VT(MS) according to the received STATUS
PDU/piggybacked STATUS PDU;

The Sender shall not confirm to upper layers the SDUs that are requested
to be discarded.

11.6.4a Reached maximum number of attempts

If VT(MRW) = MaxMRW, the Sender shall:

\- terminate the SDU discard with explicit signalling procedure;

\- stop the timer Timer\_MRW if it was started;

\- initiate the RLC RESET procedure (see subclause 11.4).

### 11.6.5 Expiration of timer Timer\_MRW

If Timer\_MRW expires before the discard procedure is terminated, the
Sender shall:

\- increment VT(MRW) by one;

\- if VT(MRW)\<MaxMRW:

\- set the MRW SUFI as previously transmitted (even if additional SDUs
were discarded in the mean-time);

\- include the MRW SUFI in a new status report (if other SUFIs are
included, their contents shall be updated);

\- transmit the status report by either including it in a STATUS PDU or
piggybacked in an AMD PDU;

\- restart Timer\_MRW for this discard procedure according to the
description in subclause 9.5.

> \- else (if VT(MRW) = MaxMRW):

\- perform the actions specified in subclause 11.6.4a.

### 11.6.6 Abnormal cases

#### 11.6.6.1 Reception of obsolete/corrupted MRW SUFI by the Receiver

If the received MRW SUFI contains outdated information about the
reception window (reception window already moved further than MRW SUFI
is indicating), the Receiver shall:

\- discard the MRW SUFI;

\- set the SN\_ACK field in the MRW\_ACK SUFI to the current value of
VR(R);

\- set the N field in the MRW\_ACK SUFI to \"0000\";

\- include the MRW\_ACK SUFI in the next STATUS PDU/piggybacked STATUS
PDU to be transmitted, according to subclause 11.5.2.

#### 11.6.6.2 Void

#### 11.6.6.3 Reception of obsolete/corrupted MRW\_ACK SUFI by the Sender

The Sender shall discard the received MRW\_ACK SUFI if one of the
following cases occurs:

\- no ongoing SDU discard with explicit signalling procedure; or

\- the SN\_ACK field in the received MRW\_ACK SUFI \< the
SN\_MRW~LENGTH~ field in the transmitted MRW SUFI; or

\- the SN\_ACK field in the received MRW\_ACK SUFI = the SN\_MRW~LENGTH~
field in the transmitted MRW SUFI, and the N field in the received
MRW\_ACK SUFI is not equal to the N~LENGTH~ field in the transmitted MRW
SUFI; or

\- the SN\_ACK field in the received MRW\_ACK SUFI \> the
SN\_MRW~LENGTH~ field in the transmitted MRW SUFI, and the N field in
the received MRW\_ACK SUFI is not equal to \"0000\".
