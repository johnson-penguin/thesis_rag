4 General
=========

Current TSG RAN WG4 specifications have been done according to the
requirements for the general purpose base stations (NodeBs)
applications. For the UTRA evolution requirement specifications for
other types of base stations are needed as well to take into account
different use scenarios and radio environments. In this technical
report, base station classification is described and requirements for
each base station class are derived.

5 System scenarios
==================

This section describes the system scenarios for UTRA operation that are
considered when defining base station classes. It also includes typical
radio parameters that are used to derive requirements.

5.1 Indoor Environment
----------------------

### 5.1.1 Path Loss Model

The indoor path loss model expressed in dB is in the following form,
which is derived from the COST 231 indoor model:

L = 37 + 20 Log~10~I + Σ k~wi~ L~wi~ + 18.3 n ^((n+2)/(n+1)-0.46)^

where:

R transmitter-receiver separation given in metres

k~wi~ number of penetrated walls of type i

L~wi~ loss of wall type i

n number of penetrated floors

Two types of internal walls are considered. Light internal walls with a
loss factor of 3.4 dB and regular internal walls with a loss factor of
6.9 dB.

If internal walls are not modelled individually, the indoor path loss
model is represented by the following formula:

L = 37 + 30 Log10I + 18.3 n ((n+2)/(n+1)-0.46)

where:

R transmitter-receiver separation given in metres;

n number of penetrated floors

Slow fading deviation in pico environment is assumed to be 6 dB.

5.2 Mixed Indoor -- Outdoor Environment
---------------------------------------

### 5.2.1 Propagation Model

Distance attenuation inside a building is a pico cell model as defined
in Chapter 5.1.1. In outdoors UMTS30.03 model is used \[5\].

Attenuation from outdoors to indoors is sketched in Figure 5.1 below. In
figure star denotes receiving object and circle transmitting object.
Receivers are projected to virtual positions. Attenuation is calculated
using micro propagation model between transmitter and each virtual
position. Indoor attenuation is calculated between virtual transmitters
and the receiver. Finally, lowest pathloss is selected for further
calculations. Only one floor is considered.

The total pathloss between outdoor transmitter and indoor receiver is
calculated as

L = L~micro~ + L~OW~ + Σ k~wi~ L~wi~ + a \* R ,

where:

L~micro~ Micro cell pathloss according UMTS30.03 Outdoor to Indoor and
Pedestrian Test Environment pathloss model

LOW outdoor wall penetration loss \[dB\]

R virtual transmitter-receiver separation given in metres;

kwi number of penetrated walls of type I;

Lwi loss of wall type I;

a = 0.8 attenuation \[dB/m\]

Slow fading deviation in mixed pico-micro environment shall be 6 dB.

Propagation from indoors to outdoors would be symmetrical with above
models.

Parameters related to propagation models are summarised in Table 5.1.

  ----------------------------------- -------------------

5.3 Minimum coupling loss (MCL)
-------------------------------

Minimum Coupling Loss (MCL) is defined as the minimum distance loss
including antenna gain measured between antenna connectors.

### 5.3.1 MCL for Local Area scenario

The minimum coupling loss between Ues is independent of the scenario,
therefore the same minimum coupling loss is assumed for all
environments.

Local area BSs are usually mounted under the ceiling, on wall or some
other exposed position. In \[4\] chapter 4.1.1.2 a minimal separation of
2 metres between UE and indoor BS is assumed. Free space path loss is
defined in \[4\] as:

Path loss \[dB\] = 38.25 + 20 log10(d \[m\])

Taking into account 0 dBi antenna gain for Local area BS and UE and a
body loss of 1 dB at the terminal, a MCL of 45.27 dB is obtained. The
additional 2 dB cable loss at the BS as proposed in TR 25.942 is not
considered.

The assumed MCL values are summarised in table 5.2.

Table 5.2: Minimum Coupling Losses

  ------------------------------- -------
                                  MCL
  MS ↔ MS                         40 dB
  Local area BS ↔ MS              45 dB
  Local area BS ↔ Local area BS   45 dB

5.4 FDD Base Station Classification for Medium range BS class
-------------------------------------------------------------

### 5.4.1 Proposal for Medium range (micro) BS class output power

#### 5.4.1.1 Discussion

2 contributions were presented during the TSG-RAN WG4 meeting \#26
proposing a maximum output power requirement for the Medium range BS
class.

Contributions were proposing a value of 37 dBm and 39 dBm for the
maximum output power requirement for the Medium range BS class. It was
concluded that results from both simulations were in good agreement
which each other. It could be concluded that the capacity loss for the
macro layer will be at most 5.8 % for a 37 dBm MR network layer and an
upper bound of 6.3 % for a 39 dBm MR network layer was established.

Taking into account that capacity losses of approximately the same order
may also occur for uncoordinated macro-macro networks and furthermore,
that the TX powers of the studied MR BSs were in excess of the required
TX power for coverage, it was concluded that also a 38 dBm micro layer
should lead to acceptable capacity losses.

As both proposals differed by only 2 dB the value of 38 dBm was
suggested and approved as a consensus requirement

The detailed simulation assumptions and results can be found in the
informative Annex A.3.

#### 5.4.1.2 Proposal

Based on the above investigation, the proposed maximum output power,
which is recommended for the Medium range BS, is +38 dBm as shown in the
table below:

Table 5.3: Base Station maximum output power

  ----------------- --------------------------
  BS Class          Maximum output power
  Medium range BS   [\<]{.underline} +38 dBm

5.5 FDD Base Station Classification for Local area BS class
-----------------------------------------------------------

### 5.5.1 Proposal for Local area (pico) BS class output power

#### 5.5.1.1 Discussion

2 contributions were presented during the TSG-RAN WG4 meeting \#26
proposing a maximum output power requirement for the Local area BS
class. It was concluded that the output power of Local area BS should be
less than +20dBm in order to maintain the capacity deterioration less
than 5% when 10% of micro network Ues are in the building. Another
conclusion was that even for a 30 dBm LA network layer, interference
caused capacity losses in the micro layer could only occur for loads
which are unrealistic from the code capacity limit point of view.

During the discussions the following 2 aspects were identified:

1\) propagation losses in the the agred micro-pico scenario are
relatively low compared to those occurring frequently in practice.

2\) indoor scenarios tend to be more case specific and some variation of
the interference impact across real life deployment scenarios should
therefore be taken into account.

Aspect 1) leads to an overestimation of the interference impact, as the
LA BSs use more TX power than would have been necessary from the
coverage point of view. Hence, it was felt, that also larger than 20 dBm
LA BS TX powers will lead to acceptable outage in the micro-layer in
practice, due to the more favourable statistics of the pathloss
differences.

Aspect 2) leads to the recommendation to use some extra protection for
the micro layer and hence an additional 6 dB safety margin relative to
the 30 dBm value is proposed.

The value 24 dBm was agreed and approved by RAN WG4 as a consensus
requirement.

In order to capture the reasoning behind this requirement, the related
simulation results will be added into an informative Annex A.4.

#### 5.5.1.2 Proposal

Based on the above investigation, the proposed maximum output power,
which is allowed for the Local area BS, is +24 dBm as shown in the table
below.

Table 5.4: Base Station maximum output power

  --------------- ----------------------
  BS Class        Maximum output power
  Local area BS   +24 dBm
  --------------- ----------------------

6 Base station classes
======================

This section describes how the base station classes are defined.

Base station class criteria
---------------------------

Different sets of requirements are derived from calculations based on
Minimum Coupling Loss between BS and UE. Each set of requirements
corresponds to a base station class is used as criteria for
classification. Three classes are defined: Wide Area BS class, Medium
Range BS class and Local Area BS class.

Wide Area BS class assumes relatively high MCL, as is typically found in
outdoor macro environments, where the BS antennas are located in masts,
roof tops or high above street level. Existing requirements are used, as
they are in \[1\], for the base station intended for general-purpose
applications.

Medium Range BS class assumes medium MCL, as typically found in outdoor
micro environments, where the BS antennas are located below roof tops.

Local Area BS class assumes relatively low MCL, as is typically found
indoors (offices, subway stations etc) where antennas are located on the
ceilings or walls or possibly built-in in the BS on the wall. Low-CL can
also be found outdoors on hot spot areas like market place, high street
or railway station. New requirements, as defined in this TR, are set for
the Local Area BS class.

### Text proposal for 4.2 Base station classes

The requirements in this specification apply to both Wide Area Base
Stations and Local Area Base Stations, unless otherwise stated.

Wide Area Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived from
Macro Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum coupling losses equal to70
dB. The Wide Area Base Station class has the same requirements as the
base station for General Purpose application in Release 99, Rel-4 and
Rel-5.

Medium Range Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived
from Micro Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equal to
53dB..

Local Area Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived from
Pico Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum coupling losses equal to
45dB.

7 Changes for the Release 6 in addition to Release 5
====================================================

7.1 Changes in 25.104
---------------------

This section describes the considered changes to requirements on BS
minimum RF characteristics, with respect to Release 5 requirements in
TS25.104.

### 7.1.1 Frequency error

#### 7.1.1.1 New requirement

In the present system the mobile has to be designed to work with a
Doppler shift caused by speeds up to 250 km/h at 2100 MHz. This
corresponds to a frequency offset of

\[Doppler shift, Hz\] = \[UE velocity, m/s\] \* \[Carrier frequency,
Hz\] / \[speed of light, m/s\]

= (250 \* 1000/3600) \* 2.1 \* 10\^9 / (3 \*10\^8) Hz

≈ 486 Hz

At present, the BS requirement is 0.05 ppm, corresponding to 105 Hz at
2100 MHz.

In this case, the mobile must be able to successfully decode signals
with offset of

\[present UE decode offset, Hz\] = \[frequency error, Hz\] + \[max.
Doppler shift, Hz\]

= 486 Hz + 105 Hz

= 591 Hz

The frequency error requirement for local area BS class is proposed to
be relaxed to 0.1ppm.

\[frequency error, ppm\] = 0.1 ppm

This corresponds to a maximum UE speed of 196km/h.

\[max. new Doppler shift\] = \[present UE decode offset\] -- \[frequency
error, Hz\]

= 591 Hz -- 210 Hz

= 381 Hz

\[UE velocity, km/h\] = \[speed of light, km/h\] \* \[Doppler shift,
Hz\] / \[Carrier frequency, Hz\]

= (3 \*10\^8 \* 381 \* 3600) / (2.1 \* 10\^9 \* 1000)

= 196 km/h

#### 7.1.1.2 Text proposal for 6.3.1 Minimum requirement

*6.3.1 Minimum Requirement*

The modulated carrier frequency of the Wide area BS shall be accurate to
within ± 0.05 ppm observed over a period of one power control group
(timeslot).

The modulated carrier frequency of the Medium range BS shall be accurate
to within ± 0.1 ppm observed over a period of one power control group
(timeslot).

The modulated carrier frequency of the Local Area BS shall be accurate
to within ± 0.1 ppm observed over a period of one power control group
(timeslot).

Table 6.0: Frequency error minimum requirement

  ----------------- --------------
  **BS class**      **accuracy**
  wide area BS      ±0.05 ppm
  medium range BS   ±0.1 ppm
  local area BS     ±0.1 ppm
  ----------------- --------------

### Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR)

No changes based on the new Medium Range and Local area BS classes.

The capacity losses due to ACLR localized around the Local Area BS
should be studied further and minuted in this section.

For Japan, specific considerations of Out-of-band emission requirements
for WA, MR and LA-BS were made. The change of the ACLR requirement is
limited to Japan and does not apply to other regions. The background is
that only Category A spurious emissions requirements apply in Japan. In
other regions, the tighter BS spectrum mask and Category B spurious
emissions requirements are also applied, which gives a very different
situation. In this case the BS spectrum mask overrides the spurious
emission limit for lower power BS and there will be no "unbalanced
situation" for most power levels. The change is based on the
considerable relaxation of the ACLR requirement for low power base
stations being agreed in Japan as explained in Tdoc. R4-060414 and it
will also become a part of the regulatory requirements of Japan. Based
on this, it was agreed in RAN4 to introduce a new note for a certain
region as seen below. It is also agreed that the note is only applicable
in Japan which is captured in section 4.3 in \[1\] as a regional
requirement.

In the note introduced for BS ACLR, the minimum requirement of --8.0
dBm/3.84 MHz (for Band I and Band IX) and +2.0 dBm/3.84 MHz (for Band
VI) are derived from -13dBm/1MHz and -13dBm/100kHz respectively with
test tolerance of 0.8dB taking into account. The values -13dBm/1MHz and
-13dBm/100kHz corrsponds to Category A spurious emission requirement
specified in Table 6.8 in \[1\].

The additional changes on a regional note for ACLR requirement in

### 7.1.5 Adjacent Channel Selectivity (ACS)

The chapter 7.4.1 TS 25.104 REL-6 should be changed as following:

*Adjacent Channel Selectivity (ACS)*

Adjacent channel selectivity (ACS) is a measure of the receiver ability
to receive a wanted signal at is assigned channel frequency in the
presence of a single code W-CDMA modulated adjacent channel signal at a
given frequency offset from the center frequency of the assigned
channel. ACS is the ratio of the receiver filter attenuation on the
assigned channel frequency to the receiver filter attenuation on the
adjacent channel(s).

*Minimum requirement*

The BER shall not exceed 0.001 for the parameters specified in Table
7.3.

### 7.1.8 Demodulation in static propagation conditions

No changes based on the new Medium Range BS class.

### 7.1.9 Demodulation of DCH in multipath fading conditions

The chapter 8.3.4 TS 25.104 REL-6 should be changed as following:

*Multipath fading Case 4*

The performance requirement of DCH in multipath fading Case 4 in case of
a Wide Area BS is determined by the maximum Block Error Ratio (BLER )
allowed when the receiver input signal is at a specified E~b~/N~0~
limit. The BLER is calculated for each of the measurement channels
supported by the base station.

*Minimum requirement*

 Changes in 25.141
-----------------

This section describes the considered changes to base station
conformance testing, with respect to Release 5 requirements in TS25.141.

Approved changes for 25.141 can be found from documents R4-021695 and
R4-030350. Changes are not repeated here.

Additional changes on ALCR were made as a regional requirement in Japan,
which capturing the changes in the core requirement in section 7.1.2 in
this TR. The change is to introduce a new note for a certain region as
seen below. It is also agreed that the note is only applicable in Japan
which is captured in section 4.7 in \[3\] as a regional requirement.

In the note introduced for BS ACLR, the test requirement of --7.2
dBm/3.84 MHz(for Band I and Band IX) and +2.8 dBm/3.84 MHz (for Band VI)
are derived from -13dBm/1MHz and -13dBm/100kHz respectively. The values
-13dBm/1MHz and -13dBm/100kHz corrsponds to Category A spurious emission
requirement specified in Table 6.8 in \[1\].

The additional changes on a regional note for ACLR requirement in
TS25.141 \[4\] can be found in documents R4-060685(for Release 6) and
R4-060686(for Release 7).

A.1.1 Receiver sensitivity
--------------------------

### A.1.1.1 Macro to micro multi-operator case

A multi-operator Macro-Micro scenario (as in TR 25.942 chapter 5.1.3.2)
was investigated whereas the UL capacity of the system is calculated as
a function of the Micro BS noise floor. The outcome is a relative UL
capacity (either for the Micro or Macro system) as a function of the
Micro noise floor.

The Macro-Micro cell layout consists of a finite micro cell layer
(Manhattan cell grid environment) under a much larger finite macro
network. The area close to the Micro network and the simulation input
parameters are specified in TR 25.942 chapter 5.1.3.2. The used
Macro-Micro cell deployment is as following:

![](media/image3.wmf){width="5.267361111111111in" height="4.16875in"}

Figure A.1: Macro-Micro network deployment (units are in meter).

The number of BS in this scenario is 72 Micro BS and 36 Macro BS. The
chosen number of Macro BS ensures that the Micro cell grid experience
infinite Macro cell grid (not all macro BS:s are shown in Figure A.1
which is a zoomed picture showing the area close to the Micro cell
grid).

A number of Monte Carlo simulations were done to determine the impact of
different Micro reference sensitivity levels versus UL capacity loss in
both Micro and Macro cells where Micro and Macro cells are deployed at
adjacent frequencies. The results are applicable both for a
multi-operator or a single operator case. More details about simulations
parameters and assumptions can be found in chapter A.1.1.3.

### A.1.1.2 Simulation results

The Macro and the Micro networks are loaded to 75 % of pole capacity in
a single layer system. This corresponds to 6 dB average noise rise in
the Macro network. Simulations are done for a Micro noise floor ranges
of --103 to --80 dBm.

The relative UL capacity of the Macro and Micro system as function of
the Micro BS noise floor is shown in Figure A.2 (see also chapter
A.1.1.4):

![](media/image4.wmf){width="5.608333333333333in"
height="3.5277777777777777in"}

Figure A.2: Relative UL capacity versus Micro BS noise floor.

The blue curve in Figure A.2 shows the relative Micro UL capacity under
influence of interference from the Macro network. The UL Micro capacity
is not affected by the Macro layer. The red curve in Figure A.2 shows
the relative Macro UL capacity when the Micro BS noise floor is
increased .The Macro UL capacity is affected when the Micro noise floor
is increased.

The Micro capacity in presense of another adjacent Micro system was also
investigated and no significant impact (smaller than 0.5%) was seen. The
scenario is described in chapter A.1.1.5.

In a multi-operator environment, it is important to minimise the impact
from a Micro cell grid on the Macro cells. Utilizing the already
existing Macro-Macro multi-operator results stated in TR 25.942 chapter
5.1.3.1 allowing maximum of 3% Macro UL capacity loss, it would be
possible to desensitise the Micro BS relative to Macro BS reference
sensitivity by 16 dB resulting in a BS noise floor of --87dBm.

On the other hand these results are based on an antenna gain of 11dBi.
Assuming a lower antenna gain of e.g. 5dBi the impact to the Macro
network will increase significant due to the shape of the curve. It is
proposed to maintain a low impact from Micro to Macro layer also for
smaller antenna gains and recommend only 10 dB Micro desensitisation
(stay in the flat part of the curve) that results in 1.5% Macro UL
capacity loss for 11dBi antennas and 3% for 5dBi antennas.

The resulting 1.5% Macro capacity loss is valid for this scenario and is
believed to be smaller in a real network since the scenario in TR 25.942
chapter 5.1.3.2 is a worst-case one.

A.1.2 Blocking, ACS, and Intermodulation
----------------------------------------

### A.1.2.1 Macro to micro multi-operator case

A multi-operator Macro-Micro scenario (as in TR 25.942 chapter 5.3.2)
was investigated whereas the power level at the Micro BS receivers,
based on the signals transmitted from the Ues connected to a FDD Wide
Area (Macro) base station (BS), was calculated. The outcomes are overall
CDF (Cumulative Probability Density Function) curves dependent on the
used Macro cell size, the simulated service (speech and data 144kbps)
and the maximum output power of the Ues.

The Macro-Micro cell layout consists of a finite Micro cell layer
(Manhattan grid) under a much larger finite macro network. The area
close to the Micro network and the simulation input parameters are
specified in TR 25.942 chapter 5.1.3.2. The used Macro-Micro cell
deployment is shown in Figure A.6.

The number of BS in this scenario is 72 Micro BS and 36 Macro BS. Macro
cells scenarios with cell radii of 1km, 2km and 5km were used for the
simulations. The scenario of an interfering 5 km macro cell across
microcells is 29ccurrenc unrealistic and the results shown for this case
are mainly for additional information. The chosen number of Macro BS
ensures that the Micro cell grid experience infinite Macro cell grid
(not all macro BS\`s are shown in Figure A.6 which is a zoomed picture
showing the area close to the Micro cell grid).

Additional to the scenarios stated in TR 25.942 chapter 5.1.3.2 a
comparable multi-operator Micro-Micro scenario was investigated whereas
the power level at the Micro BS receivers of network 1, based on the
signals transmitted from the Ues connected to a Micro BS of network 2,
was calculated. The outcomes are overall CDF curves dependent on the
simulated service (speech and data 144kbps). The layout for a single
Micro network is described in TR 25.942 chapter 5.3.1.2., the
description of the interfering micro-micro network topology and
simulation parameters can be found in 5.2.4 in 25.942.

For all scenarios described above a number of Monte Carlo simulations
were done to determine the Interfering Signal mean power level for a
victim Micro class BS in FDD mode. More details about simulations
parameters and assumptions can be found in chapter A.1.2.3.

### A.1.2.2 Simulation results

input.

**Figure A.9**: Zoomed CDF curves for the received interferer power at
the BS input.

Figures A.8 and A.9 show, as overview, the overall CDF of the input
signals to the receiver for different scenarios. It can be seen that the
maximum power levels based on the Ues connected to a second Micro cell
is lower than the maximum power level created by the Ues connected to a
Macro BS. Due to this fact the resulting blocking requirements must base
on Ues connected to a Macro BS. The following figures contain zoomed
plots for CDF values dependent on different scenarios.

**Figure A.10**: Zoom: Macro -- Micro Blocking (Average) Speech in one
plot UE 21 dBm 1,2 and 5km

Figure A.10 shows a typical scenario for speech Ues (21dBm) in a Macro
cell network dependent on the used cell radii of 1, 2 or 5 km.

**Figure A.11:** Zoom: Macro -- Micro Blocking data in one plot UE 33
dBm 1,2 and 5km.

Figure A.11 shows a typical scenario for pure data Ues (33dBm) in a
Macro cell network with cell radii of 1, 2 or 5 km.

#### A.1.2.2.1 Blocking performance

According to TR25.942, Sect 8.4.2.2 the target blocking probability for
a macro-macro scenario was assumed to be 1e-4 for the victim BS.
Considering that a micro BS will typically deploy only 1 carrier and
also that additional coverage may be available from an overlaid macro
network (ie single operator HCS scenario), the event of blocking a micro
BS may be considered as less severe then the blocking of a multi-carrier
macro BS. Hence, a slightly higher blocking probability of 2e-4 is
assumed for the micro BS to reflect this difference and to avoid overly
conservative blocking criteria.

It has been shown e.g. in Figure A.10 and A.11 that the Blocking
performance requirement for a general purpose BS of --40dBm interfering
Signal mean power, as it is specified in TS 25.104 (Rel.99, Rel. 4 and
Rel. 5), is not sufficient for a FDD Medium Range (Micro) base station
(BS).

It has been shown in Figure A.11 (which represents the worst case) that
for a high power UE (33dBm, data 144kbps) only in 0.02% of the cases the
received power is larger or equal to --35dBm and it is recommended to
use this value as new blocking requirement.

#### A.1.2.2.2 Adjacent Channel Selectivity

The ACIR (Adjacent Channel Interference Power Ratio) is in the up-link
dominated by the ACLR performance of the terminals. Therefore it is not
needed to change the minimum selectivity for the medium range BS from
the selectivity used for a general purpose BS, as specified in TS 25.104
(Rel.99, Rel. 4 and Rel. 5).

Additional it is expected that the ACS should be tested with a wanted
signal 6 dB above sensitivity as for a general purpose BS.

Based on the assumptions described before it is recommended to change
the interferer signal mean power level linear with the wanted signal
mean power. Based on a 10dB relaxed sensitivity for a Micro BS, as it
was recommended in chapter A.1.1.2, the following values are proposed:

Wanted signal mean power: -105dBm (-115dBm general purpose BS)

Interfering signal mean power: -42dBm (-52dBm general purpose BS)

#### A.1.2.2.3 Intermodulation Characteristics

Receiver intermodulation can occur when two interfering signals with a
particular relationship are applied to a BS receiver. The probability of
two signals interfering the same BS simultaneously should be in the same
order than probability for blocking interferer level. We assume a
reasonable value of 0.01% . Assuming two independent networks the
probability is the multiplication of the probability of an interferer
power level based on network 1 and the corresponding probability based
on network 2.

Starting with the likely scenario with two networks, one Macro and one
Micro, serving Ues which interferes a victim Micro BS. In this case the
interferer levels are normally not equal resulting in one Interferer
with higher power (Int~high~) and one Interferer with low power
(Int~low~). On the other hand it is beneficial to recalculate a
requirement based on equal interferers. This approach allows one
requirement covering different scenarios. Based on a simple IM3 scenario
the following formula can be used:

Equivalent Interfering Signal mean power \[dBm\] = (2\* Int~high~
\[dBm\] + Int~low~ \[dBm\])/ 3

**The CDF curve of a Micro -- Micro scenario is very sharp (see Figure
X10). The probability of an interference signal of \> -66dBm is smaller
than 1% but the probability of an interference signal of \> -68dBm is in
the order of 10%. Keeping the overall required probability of 0.01% and
using a 10% probability for the interference of the Micro network a
target value of 0.999 for the CDF of a Macro network is remaining. This
results in an interferer level of --33dBm for the** Int~high~**. (Figure
X11a) The calculated interferer levels are:**

Interferer Requirement \[dBm\] = (2\* (-33) \[dBm\] +(-68) \[dBm\])/ 3 =
-44.7dBm

Based on the calculation above an interfering signal mean power level of
--44dBm is proposed. This value is 9dB smaller than the proposed
interferer level of --35dBm for blocking. This difference is in the same
order of magnitude like the difference between the interferers for
blocking and intermodulation in case of a wide area BS.

Assuming now two equal but independent Macro or Micro networks serving
Ues which interferers a victim Micro BS. In this case the probability
for one interfering signal increasing the required power level at the
Micro BS receiver should be smaller than 1.41 %. It is shown in Figure
A.9 that the proposed requirement of --44dBm interferer level for a
medium range BS is sufficient also for these scenarios.

A.2 Pico base stations in FDD mode
----------------------------------

A.2.1 Mixed microcell-picocell scenario
---------------------------------------

Studies and simulations have been performed in order to define
requirements for the Local area BS class. The simulations were done
using a mixed microcell-picocell environment, where the pico environment
is embedded in the micro environment. The size of the pico environment
is one building with 20 rooms, and the micro environment consists of 9
buildings in a 3x3 array. Figure A.12 shows a diagram of the
environment.

Figure A.12: Mixed micro-pico environment with 12 micro and 10 pico base
stations

Appropriate requirements for LA BS blocking are derived from the results
of these additional simulations.

Proposals for this and other relevant receiver requirements for the
Local area BS class will be presented in following sections.

A.2.2 Receiver sensitivity
--------------------------

A number of simulations were performed to study the impact of the noise
rise in both micro- and picocell scenarios. The results are applicable
for both multi-operator or a single operator case.

### A.2.2.1 Simulation parameters

Used simulation parameters can be found in Table A.3.

### A.2.2.2 Simulation results

Additional noise rise was studied for the both micro- and picocell BSs.
In cases where all micro users are outdoors different operators doesn't
disturb each others. There is no influence in UL.

Figure A.13 covers the situation where all micro users are located
outdoors and are using speech service. Also situation when 10 % of
microcell users are inside is presented in Figure A.13. UL noise rise in
pico is growing and this represent the worst case.

Figure A.14 covers the situation when 10 % of microcell users are
indoors. UL noise rise is presented as a function of ACIR value.

Results with data service are almost identical to speech service.
Because user bit rates are bigger, disturbance from single user is
bigger and random factors may affect the results. Micro suffers
relatively less than pico.

The worst case noise rise for picocell BSs is 15.8 dB which means 9.8 dB
noise rise compared to macro. A macro value comparable to high load with
75% pole capacity is 6 dB.

As a conclusion the simulations results show that there is no noise rise
if all micro users are located outdoors. If some users are located
indoors noise rise will rise in pico UL.

### A.2.2.3 Noise rise for UL in Picocell environment

In this chapter we analyse more detail the noise rise for UL in Picocell
environment. The most important and a typical scenario for adjacent
channel interference could be a UE at the edge of a microcell
transmitting high power in UL close to a picocell BS. However, at the
same time, the UE is receiving interference from the picocell BS on the
adjacent carrier in DL. This can lead to DL blocking of an interfering
UE thus reducing the overall level of adjacent channel interference to
picocell BS. A detailed analysis is presented in section A.2.2.4. As a
result a noise rise is 4 dB...11.7 dB depending on the bit rate in the
UL (12.2 kbps...144 kbps).

The analytical study indicates that the additional noise rise in
picocell due to other operator microcell is in the range of 4 dB...11.7
dB above the microcell interference levels. Microcell noise rise
compared to macrocell was \<2 dB as presented in \[5\]. Additional
picocell noise rise compared to current specification will be though
13.7 dB in the worst case.

### A.2.2.4 UL noise rise calculation for the picocell BS

The additional UL noise rise in WCDMA FDD picocell BS due the adjacent
channel operation has been computed here. The basic scenario has been
shown in Figure A.15.

Figure A.15. Micro- and picocell operation at adjacent frequency bands.

The required power for the microcell user can be computed by the
equation:

$\frac{\frac{W}{R}\frac{p_{m}}{L_{m}}}{\frac{P_{p}}{L_{p} \cdot \text{ACIR}_{\text{DL}}} + I_{\text{own}}(1 - \alpha) + I_{\text{oth}} + N} \geq \rho$,

where Pm is the power allocated to the microcell user, Lm is the
pathloss from the microcell antenna to the mobile, Pp is the power of
the pico BS, Lp is the pathloss from pico base station to the mobile and
ACIR\_DL is the adjacent channel interferenece in the downlink. Assuming
that most of the interference comes from an other operator's pico cell
the minimum required pathloss:

$L_{p} \geq \frac{\rho \cdot R \cdot L_{m}}{W \cdot \text{ACIR}_{\text{DL}}}\frac{P_{p}}{p_{m}}$

The uplink interference at the pico BS can therefore computed as:

$I = \frac{p_{m}}{P_{p}} \cdot \frac{P_{\text{UE}} \cdot W \cdot \text{ACIR}_{\text{DL}}}{\text{ACIR}_{\text{UL}} \cdot \rho \cdot R \cdot L_{m}}$

$\frac{W}{R_{\text{UL}}}\frac{P_{\text{UE}}}{L_{m}I_{\text{UL}}} = \rho_{\text{UL}} \Rightarrow P_{\text{UE}} = \frac{\rho_{\text{UL}}L_{m}I_{\text{UL}}R_{\text{UL}}}{W}$

$I = \frac{p_{m}}{P_{p}} \cdot \frac{W \cdot \text{ACIR}_{\text{DL}}}{\text{ACIR}_{\text{UL}} \cdot \rho \cdot R \cdot L_{m}}\frac{\rho_{\text{UL}}L_{m}I_{\text{UL}}R_{\text{UL}}}{W}$

$I = \frac{p_{m}}{P_{p}} \cdot \frac{\rho_{\text{UL}}I_{\text{UL}}R_{\text{UL}} \cdot \text{ACIR}_{\text{DL}}}{\text{ACIR}_{\text{UL}} \cdot \rho \cdot R}$

The DL dedicated channel power in micro can be written as:

$p_{m} = \frac{P_{\text{pilot}}\text{Rρ}}{\chi \cdot R_{\text{ref}}\rho_{\text{ref}}}$,

where χ is the power adjustment 40ccurrenc; when χ=1 (0 dB), the
reference service is given the same power as for the pilot channel, when
χ=2 (3 db), for instance, the reference service is given 3 dB less power
than for the pilot.

The interference can be then written as:

$I = \frac{P_{\text{pilot}}\text{Rρ}}{\chi \cdot R_{\text{ref}}\rho_{\text{ref}}}\frac{1}{P_{p}} \cdot \frac{\rho_{\text{UL}}I_{\text{UL}}R_{\text{UL}} \cdot \text{ACIR}_{\text{DL}}}{\text{ACIR}_{\text{UL}} \cdot \rho \cdot R} = \frac{P_{\text{pilot}}}{\chi \cdot R_{\text{ref}}\rho_{\text{ref}}}\frac{1}{P_{p}} \cdot \frac{\rho_{\text{UL}}I_{\text{UL}}R_{\text{UL}} \cdot \text{ACIR}_{\text{DL}}}{\text{ACIR}_{\text{UL}}}$

RUL, ρUL are UL parameters for the microcell RAB

Rref, ρref are DL parameters of the microcell ref RAB

So what we can notice is that the interference in UL in pico is
independent on the pathloss between micro and pico.

Then, if

Ppilot=30 dBm

χ=1

Rref=12.2 kbps

ρUL=5dB

ρref=8dB

RUL=12.2kbps

ACIR\_DL/ACIR\_UL=-3 dB ;

Pp=20 dBm

$\begin{matrix}
I = \frac{P_{\text{pilot}}}{\chi \cdot R_{\text{ref}}\rho_{\text{ref}}}\frac{1}{P_{p}} \cdot \frac{\rho_{\text{UL}}I_{\text{UL}}R_{\text{UL}} \cdot \text{ACIR}_{\text{DL}}}{\text{ACIR}_{\text{UL}}} \\
\frac{\text{1000}}{1 \cdot}\frac{1}{\text{100}} \cdot \frac{I_{\text{UL}}}{2 \cdot 2} = 2\text{.}5 \cdot I_{\text{UL}} = 4 + I_{\text{UL}}(\text{dB}) \\
\end{matrix}$

So it is 4 dB above the micro interference levels

Then, if

RUL=144kbps

ρUL=2dB

ACIR\_DL/ACIR\_UL=-3 dB ;

$\begin{matrix}
I = \frac{P_{\text{pilot}}}{\chi \cdot R_{\text{ref}}\rho_{\text{ref}}}\frac{1}{P_{p}} \cdot \frac{\rho_{\text{UL}}I_{\text{UL}}R_{\text{UL}} \cdot \text{ACIR}_{\text{DL}}}{\text{ACIR}_{\text{UL}}} \\
\frac{\text{1000}}{1 \cdot}\frac{1}{\text{100}} \cdot \frac{I_{\text{UL}}}{2 \cdot 4} \cdot \frac{\text{144}}{\text{12}\text{.}2} = \text{14} \cdot I_{\text{UL}} = \text{11}\text{.}7 + I_{\text{UL}}(\text{dB}) \\
\end{matrix}$

So it is 11.7 dB above the micro interference levels.

### A.2.2.5 Reference sensitivity level

The analytical study in section A.2.2.4 showed that additional noise
rise in pico cells due to another operator's interfering micro cells is
in the range of 4 dB...13.7 dB. Noise rise is depending on the bit rate
in the UL (12.2 kbps...144 kbps). For the worst case, the picocell noise
rise was 13.7 dB compared to a macro cell. Based on that 14 dB
sensitivity degradation is proposed for the Local area BS class.

### A.2.3.2 Dynamic range

It is proposed not to tighten the requirement for the Receiver dynamic
range for the LA BS class. It should be tested with a wanted signal 30
dB above sensitivity. Correspondingly, the difference between wanted and
interfering signals remains the same as for Wide area BS.

Following signals are proposed for Dynamic range:

\- wanted signal: --77dBm

\- interfering AWGN signal: --59 dBm.

### A.2.3.3 ACS

The ACIR (Adjacent Channel Interference Power Ratio) is in the up-link
dominated by the ACLR performance of the terminals. Therefore it is not
needed to change the minimum selectivity for the LA BS from the
selectivity used for a general purpose BS, as specified in TS 25.104.

Based on these assumptions, it is recommended to change the interferer
signal mean power level linear with the wanted signal mean power.
Additionally, it is expected that the ACS should be tested with a wanted
signal 6 dB above sensitivity as for a general purpose BS.

Following signals are proposed for ACS:

\- wanted signal --101 dBm

\- interfering signal --38 dBm.

### A.2.3.4 Blocking characteristics

In order to derive a blocking requirement, we may want to relate it to
the ACS requirement. For a single carrier LA BS, the impact of adjacent
channel interference reaching a given interference level (ie -38 dBm as
proposed in the previous section) is essentially the same as if a
blocking level would be reached; in either case the LA BS receiver will
be desensitized by 6 dB effecting the same amount of connections (due to
the single carrier assumption).

Hence, given identical consequences of these 2 events, we may then
require the same (low) probability of occurrence for them.

There are at most 2 adjacent carriers where adjacent channel
interference can occur for a given LA BS RX carrier. However, within the
Band I allocation of 12 carriers, there may be at most 12 -- 2 -- 1 = 9
carriers where blocking (but not adjacent channel interference) may
originate from; thus having an approximately 4.5 times larger chance of
occurring (assuming the same event probabilities for ACS, respectively
blocking). The exact combinatorics should also take carriers at the band
edge into account

Hence, one may now wish to ensure that blocking does occur at least 4.5
times less than adjacent channel interference. In order to do this, we
will consider the resulting UL interference at the LA BS due to the
micro cell UE's for the following two cases:

\- blocking of micro cell UE's due to the LA BS is not considered

\- blocking of micro cell UE's due to the LA BS is considered with a
blocking threshold of --39 dBm, ie 5 dB higher than the corresponding
value from TS 25.101 (= -44 dBm).

Figure A.16 shows a simulation results for 144 kbps data service with 10
% of the micro Ues indoors (worst case) for case a) with no UE blocking
considered. As can be seen in zoomed version in Figure A.17, the
proposed interfering signal of --38 dBm for ACS corresponds to value
where 97.325% of 43ccurrences of the input signals to the receivers are
less this level. Hence, probability to get blocked by ACS will be
1-0.97325 = 0.02675.

According to above methodology, one may now wish to ensure that blocking
does occur at least 4.5 times less than adjacent channel interference.
Hence, we obtain for the probability for blocking 0.02675/ 4.5 =
0.00594. We will have CDF value 1-0.00594 = 0.9945. From the Figure
A.17, we derive the required value for interfering (blocking) signal to
be around --30 dBm.

In reality, micro cell UE's will become blocked due to the strong signal
from the LA BS, before they can cause significant interference
(blocking) to the LA BS on UL. Thus the received UL interference CDFs in
Figures A.16 and A.17 are very pessimistic and do not reflect the real
situation adequately.

Figures A.18 and A.19 show CDFs with DL UE blocking included. Ues
receiving higher interfering signal than a blocking threshold of --39
dBm will be removed from the UL interference statistics. As can be seen,
UL interference levels at LA BS are significantly reduced.

The event probabilities for "ACS blocking" are now 0.00525.
Probabilities for "blocking" are respectively 0 (i.e. LA BS blocking did
not occur at all).

Two remarks are appropriate:

\- blocker level of --44 dBm in TS 25.101 is only a minimum performance
requirement and may be exceeded by actual UE implementation. Here it is
assumed that for a 5 dB higher level (-39 dBm) blocking has indeed
occurred.

\- Micro cell UE's may also loose connection due to ACLR/spurious
emissions from LA BS under low CL conditions. This effect is, however,
not included in the CDFs and the shown results including UE blocking are
thus conservative

height="4.625694444444444in"}

Figure A.19: Received UL interference at LA BS, with UE blocking at --39
dBm

Based on these findings it is proposed that a blocker level of --30 dBm
is sufficient for a LA BS.

Blocking characteristics of the Local area BS can be tested with the
wanted signal level 6 dB above Reference sensitivity level as for Wide
area BS. For Local area BS that means the level --121 dBm + 14 dB + 6 dB
= -101 dBm.

Based on this following signals are proposed for In band blocking:

\- wanted signal --101 dBm

\- interfering signal --30 dBm.

Out of band blocking requirements can be kept unchanged except the
wanted signal which will be 6 dB above reference sensitivity level.

### A.2.3.5 Intermodulation characteristics

Receiver intermodulation can occur when two interfering signals with a
particular relationship are applied to a BS receiver. Two large
interfering signals at the same time occurs less frequently than a
single interfering signal. Due to lower probability of two large
interfering signals, the power level of the interfering signals for the
Intermodulation requirement should be lower compared to Blocking
requirement. For the Wide area BS, the level of interfering signals are
8 dB lower compared to Blocking requirement. It is proposed same
relative values also for the Local area BS.

Following signals for Intermodulation is proposed:

\- wanted signal --101 dBm

\- interfering signals --38 dBm.

A.3 Maximum output power for Medium range BS class
==================================================

A.3.1 Simulation results \#1
----------------------------

### A.3.1.1 Simulation scenario

Earlier simulations were performed based on an statistical approach
where the criteria for micro BS output power is defined as the outage
probability for uncoordinated macro network UE:s.

In order to compare the outage due to micro layer with reference cases,
simulations for single macro layer and macro-macro cell layout with
maximum offset between the two uncoordinated macro layers (worst case)
were also performed. The maximum output power of the interfering Wide
area BSs in the macro-macro cell layout was limited to the typical value
of 43dBm.

The approach is conservative because the comparison with the macro-macro
cell layout is based on interfering Wide area BS with a maximum output
power of 43dBm. In real life this value could be much higher as up to
50dBm.

### A.3.1.2 Simulation results

The new simulations were again based on the macro-micro cell layout in
where the micro cell layer were assumed to be fully loaded for different
values for micro output power. In order to compare the outage due to
micro layer with reference cases, simulations for single macro layer and
macro-macro cell layout with maximum offset between the two
uncoordinated macro layers (worst case) were performed.

The maximum output power for the interfering Wide area BSs was set to
47dBm (50W). The value of 47dBm is assumed as a realistic worst-case
scenario for the given cell layout. The maximum output power of the Wide
Area BSs of the disturbed macro layer network was kept to 43dBm and the
maximum code power was limited to 30dBm.

The outage probability on macro layer for site-to-site distances of 1 km
(cell radius of 577m) in the presence of a micro cell grid for a fixed
micro output power of 27, 30, 33, 34, 35, 36, and 37dBm for each BS are
as following:

height="3.5520833333333335in"}

Figure A.20: Outage probability for the users connected to the macro
cells for macro site-to-site distance of 1 km and a fixed maximum output
power of up to 37dBm per Medium Range BS

The simulations show that the capacity of a macro layer is reduced, due
to the presence of an uncoordinated micro or macro layer. Based on the
outage target of 5%, the capacity is nearly identical in the presence of
a macro layer where the macro BSs transmits with a constant power of
47dBm or where all the micro BS:s transmits at a constant power level of
37 dBm (see table A5)

site-to-site distance of 1 km and a fixed maximum output power of 33 and

  --------------------------------- ---------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------

### A.3.1.3 Proposal

The statistical approach based on agreed scenarios for defining the
micro BS class output power shows that the outage for macro layer UE:s
will not significantly increase, in comparison to a realistic
macro-macro cell layout, due to the presence of a micro layer
transmitting up to 37 dBm. Based on the micro-macro layer scenario a
capacity larger than 94.2% of the capacity of a single macro layer could
be expected. This indicates that when defining the maximum output power
for micro BS class, levels up to 37 dBm of micro output power is
acceptable.

Based on the above investigation, the proposed maximum output power,
which is recommended for the Medium range BS, is +37dBm.

A.3.2 Simulation results \#2
----------------------------

### A.3.2.1 Simulation scenario

This contribution provides simulation results based on the agreed
scenario in TR25.942 in order to define a suitable maximum output power
for the MR BS class.

The criteria for MR BS output power is defined so as not to cause undue
outage for an uncoordinated macro network UE:s.

### A.3.2.2 Simulation results

In here the philosophy for establishing a maximum output power
requirement for the MR BS class is to set this value as high as possible
in order to maximise the coverage per MR BS site (economic reasons), but
yet low enough, as not to cause noticeable outage on the DL of any
surrounding uncoordinated macro network.

Before studying the DL interference impact from the MR network onto the
macro network, it is appropriate to investigate the DL operating point
of the MR layer. This includes the following items:

\- DL capacity as function of MR Tx power

\- relationship between UL and DL outage

\- issue of possible code-blocking

Figure A21 shows the 12.2 kbps speech service outage on UL and DL for a
MR layer with 33 dBm TX power. It can be clearly seen that 33 dBm TX
power is in this scenario excessive in order to match the UL capacity of
approximately 95 users @ 5 % outage. This is primarily due to the
assumed high orthogonality of 94 % which effectively reduces
interference on the DL.

Figure A.21 Outage for MR layer with 33 dBm TX power

It should be also noted that the theoretical capacity of approximately
140 speech users (Assuming VA factor = 1 according to TR 25.942) @ 5 %
DL outage cannot be realized as this is in excess of the code capacity
limit, in particular, when considering realistic voice activity factors.
A similar investigation for the 144 kbps data service exhibits an even
larger (primarily because of the DL Eb/No assumptions in TR 25.942 of
voice vs data) DL/UL capacity asymmetry with DL throughput of
approximately 4.4 Mbps / site and leads hence to the same conclusion.
Therefore a naïve application of the DL load criteria (Specified for
macro/macro multi-operator DL simulations. Both networks should be
loaded up to 5 % outage ) according to TR25.942 leads obviously to a
nonsensical scenario and hence, we assume the DL load is matched to the
carried UL traffic.

From Figure A21 we can now estimate that 33 dBm -- 10\*LOG(140/95) =
31.3 dBm ≈ 31 dBm TX power would have been already sufficient for 95 %
DL coverage for the MR layer.

An important conclusion from these considerations is that this scenario
will allow us only to derive *an upper bound* of the DL capacity loss
for the macro network for a MR network *with TX powers \> 31 dBm*.

In other words, the considered micro cell propagation environment is too
"small" (in the PL sense) to justify MR BS with \> 31 dBm Tx power. The
primary reason for this is that in an obvious deviation from the
real-life situation, the in-building penetration losses are not
considered, neither are users distributed into the building blocks.

Due to this bias towards too low PLs inherent, care needs now to be
exercised when deriving requirements for the maximum TX powers of the MR
layer from this scenario.

Now we study the DL interference impact from the MR network onto the
macro network. Parameters are as in TR25.942 with exception of the DL
dedicated channel powers which are according to the limits of 25.104.

In line with the considerations of the previous Section, Figure A22
shows the upper bound of macro layer DL outage due to MR layer with 33,
36 and 39 dBm TX power respectively. When compared to the required DL
power for coverage, there is an excess of MR BS Tx power of 2, 5 and 8
dB respectively which will correspondingly overestimate the interference
impact from the MR layer towards the macro layer.

Figure A.22 Upper bound of macro layer DL Outage due to MR layer with
33, 36, 39 dBm TX power

It can be seen from Figure A22 that the capacity loss for the macro
layer will be *[upper bounded]{.underline}* by 6.3 % for a 39 dBm MR
network layer. With a propagation environment better matched to the 39
dBm TX power, i.e. micro-cells exhibiting a higher PL, the impact would
have been certainly less due to the more favourable near-far PL
distribution of the macro users. Without modifying this scenario in a
substantial way to match the 39 dBm Tx power (e.g. by introducing
in-building penetration losses), it cannot be asserted whether the
capacity losses actually will be of that size or smaller.

### A.3.2.3 Proposal

Based on the current micro-macro scenario of TR25.942 it can be
concluded that the capacity loss for the macro layer will be at most 6.3
% for a 39 dBm MR network layer, however, that assumes that the MR layer
has been operated with 8 dB more TX power than required, i.e.
overestimating the interference impact.

With these considerations in mind, the proposed maximum output power,
which is recommended for the Medium range BS, is +39 dBm.

A.4 Maximum output power for Local area BS class
================================================

A.4.1 Simulation results \#1
----------------------------

### A.4.1.1 Simulation scenario

This contribution provides simulation results based on the agreed
baseline scenario in TR 25.951 in order to define a suitable maximum
output power for the LA BS class. Necessary simulation parameters not
already specified in TR 25.951 or TR 25.942 have been defined and are
listed in Annex X.

The criteria for LA BS output power is defined so as not to cause undue
outage for an uncoordinated micro network UE:s.

### A.4.1.2 Simulation results

In here the philosophy for establishing a maximum output power
requirement for the LA BS class is to set this value as high as possible
in order to maximise the coverage per LA BS site (economic reasons), but
yet low enough not to cause noticeable outage on the DL of any
surrounding uncoordinated micro network.

All following simulation results are based on the agreed baseline
scenario of TR 25.951 see Figure A12.

The simulations were performed with all micro users located outdoors and
10 % of the micro users located indoors.

As the BS coordinates for the locations of the LA BSs have not been
fully specified in TR 25.951, these have been taken from earlier
simulations instead and are marked by the '+' in Figure A12.

There certainly exists a strong relationship between the number of LA
BSs required for providing indoor coverage and their respective TX
powers, hence this trade-off is investigated first.

The indoor propagation loss (PL) according to L = 37 + 20 Log10I + Σ kwi
Lwi as defined in TR 25.951 will lead to values \< 100 dB. This is
relatively low PL when comparing to e.g. propagation in multi-floor
buildings. It will make e.g. no sense at all for the LA operator to
deploy 10 LA BSs à 20 dBm as can be seen immediately from the resulting
excessively high DL signal levels within the building.

Figure A23 shows the 12.2 kbps speech service outage on UL and DL for
one LA BS situated at one of the center '+' in Figure A12 with 20 dBm TX
power. It can be clearly be seen that even for a single LA BS, 20 dBm is
in this scenario an excessive Tx power to match the UL capacity of
approximately 110 users @ 5 % outage. This is primarily due to the
assumed orthogonality of 94 % (according to TR 25.942).

Figure A.23 Outage for 1 LA BS with 20 dBm TX power

It should be also noted that the theoretical capacity of approximately
500 speech users @ 5 % DL outage cannot be realized as this is far in
excess of the code capacity limit. A similar investigation for the 144
kbps data service leads to the very same conclusion. Therefore a naïve
application of the DL load criteria according to TR 25.942 (Specified
for macro/micro multi-operator DL simulations. Both networks should be
loaded up to 5 % outage) leads obviously to a nonsensical scenario and
hence in here, we assume the DL load is matched to the carried UL
traffic.

From Figure A23 we can now estimate that 20 dBm -- 10\*LOG(500/110) =
13.4 dBm ≈ 14 dBm TX power would have been already sufficient for 95 %
DL coverage by a single BS. Using more than 1 LA BS will lead to even
lower required TX powers and is therefore not considered further in the
following results.

An important conclusion from these considerations is that this scenario
will allow us only to derive an upper bound of the DL capacity loss for
the micro network for LA BS with TX powers \> 14 dBm.

In line with the considerations of the previous section, Figure A24
shows the upper bound of micro layer DL outage due to 1 LA BS with 20,
24 and 30 dBm TX power respectively. Hence, when compared to the
required DL power for coverage, there is an excess of LA BS Tx power of
6, 10 and 16 dB respectively, which correspondingly overestimates the
interference impact from the LA layer towards the micro layer.

Figure A.24 Upper bound of micro layer DL Outage due to 1 LA BS with 20,
24, 30 dBm TX power

Figure A24 would at a first glance suggest that there would be a
significant (\> 5 %) impact from a LA network layer with \> 20 dBm Tx
power onto the surrounding micro network. However, also for the micro
network we have to consider a reasonable DL operating point. E.g., the 5
% DL outage point for the "30 dBm pico" curve at 1300 users total or,
equivalently, 108 speech users (with VA =1) /site cannot be realized for
realistic VA factors as this is far in excess of the code capacity
limit. The same conclusion holds for data services, here the code
capacity limit will be exceeded even sooner due to the much lower Eb/No
requirement according to TR 25.942.

#### A.4.1.3 Proposal

The conclusion is that even for a 30 dBm LA network layer, interference
caused capacity losses in the micro layer could only occur for loads
which are unrealisable from the code capacity limit point of view.

In other words, for the given scenario here, the interference impact is
purely hypothetical if realistic DL operating points are considered.

On the other hand, as these results have been established for a specific
scenario only, some extra protection for the micro layer is desirable;
we propose an additional 3 dB safety margin. Hence, the proposed maximum
output power, which is recommended for the Local area BS, is +27 dBm.

A value of +27 dBm appears also appropriate from the perspective of
balancing the UL with the DL: relative to a general purpose BS, the LA
BS will be desensitised by 14 dB. On the other hand, 27 dBm Tx power is
16 dB below the typical value of 43 dBm for a WA BS, hence UL and DL
will remain balanced.

A.4.2 Simulation results \#2

### A.4.2.1 Simulation scenario

In this section, a statistical approach on the maximum output power is
shown, which is based on TR 25.942 and TR 25.951, and the maximum output
power for the Local area BS is proposed. In the simulation, the
deployment of Micro BS and Pico BS shown in Figure A12 is used.
Parameters related to propagation models are summarized in Table A6. The
criteria for Local area BS output power is defined as the capacity
deterioration for an uncoordinated Micro network Ues.

The number of Local area BSs can be decreased as the maximum output
power of Local area BSs increases. The minimum number of the Local area
BSs that supports the received power at UE higher than --90dBm in more
than 95% area out of the entire floor is shown in Table A7.

### A.4.2.2 Simulation results

The simulation results on capacity deterioration for uncoordinated Micro
and Pico networks are shown in Figure A25.

In the simulations, the number of Local area BSs shown in Table A7 was
used. As the reference, capacity deterioration in the case of
Macro-Macro and Micro-Macro, calculated for Medium range BS class are
also shown in Figure A25.

From Figure A25, the capacity deterioration for the Micro area network
increases as Local area BS output power increases. As is shown in the
figure, the output power of Local area BS should be less than +20dBm in
order to maintain the capacity deterioration less than 5% when 10% of
micro network Ues are in the building.

Figure A.25: Capacity deterioration

### A.4.2.3 Proposal

Based on the above simulations, the proposed maximum output power for
Local area BSs is +20dBm. The proposed value is identical to the earlier
results presented in document R4-021635 where the interference between
macro and pico cells were considered.

######## Annex B (informative): Radio Network Planning Considerations

B.1 Adjacent frequency Interference
===================================

B.1.1 General
-------------

The RF specification for Base Stations is to a large extent based on
statistical averaging of interference effects. This should normally be
sufficient to eliminate significant interference effects on adjacent
frequency networks, if some simple rules (e.g. 30 dB MCL between Wide
Area BS) are followed.

Especially in the case of Local Area and Medium Range BS, also
considering some of their likely deployment environments (indoor, street
canyons) there is however a higher probability that the interference on
adjacent frequencies is localised. In these cases some co-ordination
between operators may be required.

This informative Annex considers Radio Network Planning (RNP) measures,
which can be applied in case there is significant interference between
adjacent radio networks of different hierarchy level, e.g. between a MR
and a WA network. In the following mainly aspects related to DL adjacent
channel interference will be considered.

B.1.2 Example analysis for localized interference
-------------------------------------------------

Based on a number of assumptions on deployment of networks, the relevant
parameter for the impact of DL adjacent channel interference caused by a
MR or LA Node B is the maximum output power. From the Monte-Carlo
simulation results contained in Annex A it can be seen that the DL
capacity loss for an adjacent macro layer is upper-bounded by
approximately no more than 6 % for a 38 dBm MR network layer. Similarly,
it was shown that the DL capacity impact from a 24 dBm LA network on an
adjacent MR network is of similar order.

While the average impact is thus small, there is nevertheless a chance
that a macro layer UE gets localised interference by a MR or LA Node B
under low coupling loss (CL) and weak serving signal conditions. This
will be illustrated by the following example analysis for the case of a
LA (indoor) cell interfering to an adjacent macro cell.

The following parameters will be assumed:

  ------------------------------------ ------- ------ --------------

With these service parameters we obtain for the required Ec/Io:

Required Ec/Io = -25 dB \[processing gain\] + 7 dB \[Eb/Io\] = -18 dB

The area of the localized interference around the LA BS can be estimated
as follows (In this calculation the own system (cell) interference is
not taken into account, i.e. it is assumed that ACI dominates):

1\) Maximum tolerated interference level on the own channel: -90 dBm +
18 dB \[Required Ec/Io\] = -72 dBm

2\) Maximum tolerated interference level on the adjacent channel: -72
dBm + 33 dB \[UE ACS\] = -39 dBm

3\) Required coupling loss CL towards interfering LA BS: +24 dBm -- (-39
dBm) = 63 dB

4\) Assuming the indoor path loss model from this TR for the case that
internal walls are not modelled individually and a single floor, the
indoor path loss model is represented by the following formula:

PL = 37 + 30 Log10I,

> with R the UE -- LA BS separation given in metres. From this, the
> required minimum distance towards the interfering LA BS is given by:

R = 10\^( (63 dB \[CL\] + 0 dBi \[LA BS antenna gain\] -- 37) / 30 ) =
7.36 m

As can be seen, the required minimum distance towards the interfering LA
BS depends not only on the parameters of the interfering system (i.e. TX
power, antenna gain), but also on the available DTCH signal level of the
serving macro cell.

The following figure shows the size of the localized interference around
the LA BS for serving cell received DTCH levels in the range of --70 ...
-110 dBm:

serving cell received DTCH levels

In order to further reduce the likelihood of such localized interference
events, the measures presented in the following clause may be applied.

B.1.3 Deployment guidelines to reduce interference
--------------------------------------------------

The following measures are applicable by the operator of the interfering
radio network (i.e. LA or MR network) in order to reduce the likelihood
of interference towards an adjacent band operator:

\- Avoid allocating LA, MR Node B carriers at the assigned band edge(s)
to another operator whenever possible. This may be possible e.g. at an
early UMTS deployment phase, where only part of the assigned band may be
required.

\- During a later UMTS deployment phase, for the case that an operator
wishes to deploy 2 WA carriers and one MR or LA carrier, the latter
carrier could be "sandwiched" by the WA carriers.

\- Ensure sufficiently large MCL conditions across the planned micro
cell (or in-building) coverage area. This can be facilitated by choosing
suitable antenna types, heights and locations. Note that obtaining a
sufficiently high MCL (including antenna gains) is also desirable for
the MR or LA network operator due to the --25 dBm/3.84 MHz maximum input
level requirement of the UE \[25.101\]; hence, the MCL will also depend
on the intended maximum Node B TX power setting.

\- Match the setting of the maximum Node B TX power for MR or LA
operation to the requirements (i.e. CL) of propagation environment at
hand, i.e. avoid using substantially more TX power than is required for
the micro cell or in-building coverage. DL power planning can be
facilitated by adjusting the CPICH TX power in such a way that the
received CPICH RSCP (or Ec/Io) across the desired coverage area meets
the outage target, but on the other hand, is not unnecessarily high.
Scaling the windows of the DTCH DL power allocations accordingly, will
then also lead to appropriate DTCH power levels.

\- Co-ordination between adjacent frequency operators of output powers,
antenna sites, heights, gains and patterns, or even co-location of
interfering sites. This would reduce worst case situations where a
strong interfering signal is received by an adjacent frequency UE
connected to a BS at large coupling loss, and thus under relatively poor
radio conditions.

For temporary effects, and remaining problems a number of additional
system functionalities can be used:

\- In case that multiple WA carriers may have become available, the use
of IFHO for DL interference avoidance may be used. Hence, the UE may be
handed over to the 2^nd^ or 3^rd^ adjacent channel, which will reduce or
eliminate the interference.

\- In case that adjacent channel interference is encountered within a WA
cell, proper setting of the DTCH TX power window can provide the UE with
additional power to combat interference. Hence, there is possibility for
trading off some capacity / throughput for reducing possible DL coverage
holes.

\- In case that adjacent channel interference is encountered within a WA
cell, reduction of the allocated peak data rate (or AMR codec rate) can
provide the UE with additional power to combat interference. Hence,
there is possibility for trading off peak data rates for reducing
possible DL coverage holes.

\- For areas where the received Node B DL signals (or representatively
the CPICH RSCP's) from the own and adjacent interfering system differ by
much more than 40 dB, own system signal strength may be increased by RNP
methods. This can be done by means of directing / tilting antennas beams
towards the building in question (e.g. in case of interfering LA
network) or by building additional sites.

B.2 Intra-frequency interference
================================

B.2.1 General
-------------

The RF specification for Base Stations is to a large extent based on
statistical averaging of interference effects and on specific MCL
requirement. This should normally be sufficient to eliminate significant
interference.

In the case of Local Area and Medium Range BS, also considering some of
their likely deployment environments (indoor, street canyons) there is
however a high probability that the current UE and BS specifications
lead to localised significant intra-frequency interference and then to
localised coverage and capacity holes.

This informative Annex highlights through an example the impacts of UE
performance requirements on the range of coupling loss that can be
operated without degraded the network performance.

B.2.2 Example analysis for localized interference
-------------------------------------------------

In this paragraph, the impact of the MCL requirement on UE and BS
(either LA or MR) sensitivity is analysed.

### B.2.2.1 UL issue

Regarding the UL, a LA or MR BS can be desensitised and suffer from UL
capacity/coverage loss if the CL at which the power control causes the
UE output power to reduce to the minimum output power is significantly
higher than the MCL. In such conditions, if the UE were to move closer
to the serving BS, the power control would be unable to reduce the UE
output power further, and desensitization would occur.

Then assuming the following parameters (Table B.2) the MCL requirement
is compared to the CL value from where a UE reaches its minimum output
power.

The parameters listed in Table B.2 shows that a UE using speech service
and served by a LA BS reaches its minimum output power when the coupling
loss is such as:

-50 \[UE min output power\]-CL \[coupling loss between UE and serving
BS\]=

-107 \[LA BS reference sensitivity level\] + NR \[noise rise of the cell
corresponding to its load\]

That is to say: CL=57dB for an unloaded cell and 51dB for a 75% loaded
cell (NR=6dB) while the minimum coupling loss of a LA BS is 45dB.

The parameters listed in Table B.2 shows that a UE using speech service
and served by a MR BS reaches its minimum output power when the coupling
loss is such as:

-50 \[UE min output power\]-CL \[coupling loss between UE and serving
BS\]=

-111 \[LA BS reference sensitivity level\] + NR \[noise rise of the cell
corresponding to its load\]

That is to say: CL=61dB for an unloaded cell and 55dB for a 75% loaded
cell (NR=6dB) while the minimum coupling loss of a MR BS is 53dB.

All these evaluated coupling losses are significantly higher than the
MCL requirement of the corresponding BS classes. As a result a severe BS
desensitisation is expected if a UE is very close to its serving BS.

### B.2.2.2 DL issue

Regarding the DL, a LA or MR BS may degrade its own UE's performances
and face then DL capacity/coverage loss if the UE received input power
level is higher than the maximum requirement.

Then assuming the following parameters (Table B.3) the MCL requirement
is compared to the CL value from where a UE received its maximum input
power.

Table B.3: Assumed parameters for the DL analysis

  ------------------------- ---------- ------------- ------------- ------ --------------
  Parameter                 UE Value   LA BS Value   MR BS value   Unit   Notes
  UE maximum input level    -25                                    dBm    from 25.101
  BS maximum output power              24            38            dBm    from this TR
  MCL                                  45            53            dB     from this TR
  ------------------------- ---------- ------------- ------------- ------ --------------

The parameters listed in Table B.3 show that the maximum received input
level of a UE is reached by a serving LA BS transmitting its maximum
output power when the coupling loss is such as:

24 \[BS maximum output power\]-CL \[coupling loss between UE and serving
BS\]=-25 \[UE maximum input level\]

That is to say: CL=49dB while the minimum coupling loss is 45dB.

The parameters listed in Table B.3 show that the maximum received input
level of a UE is reached by a serving MR BS transmitting its maximum
output power when the coupling loss is such as:

38 \[BS maximum output power\]-CL \[coupling loss between UE and serving
BS\]=-25 \[UE maximum input level\]

That is to say: CL=63dB while the minimum coupling loss is 53dB.

Both these evaluated coupling losses are significantly higher than the
MCL requirement of the corresponding BS classes. As a result a UE
performances may be degraded by its serving BS.

B.2.3 Deployment guidelines to reduce interference
--------------------------------------------------

The following measures may be applied by an operator deploying a LA or a
MR network in order to reduce the likelihood of localized interference
inside its own network:

\- Ensure sufficiently large MCL conditions across the planned micro
cell or in-building coverage area. This can be facilitated by choosing
suitable antenna types, heights and locations.

\- Match the setting of the maximum Node B TX power for MR or LA
operation to the requirements (i.e. CL) of propagation environment at
hand, i.e. avoid using substantially more TX power than is required for
the micro cell or in-building coverage. DL power planning can be
facilitated by adjusting the CPICH TX power in such a way that the
received CPICH RSCP (or Ec/Io) across the desired coverage area meets
the outage target, but on the other hand, is not unnecessarily high.
Scaling the windows of the DTCH DL power allocations accordingly, will
then also lead to appropriate DTCH power levels.

\- Implement efficient handover algorithms to escape low coupling loss
situation.
