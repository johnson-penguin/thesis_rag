4 Multiplexing, channel coding and interleaving for the 1.28 Mcps, 3.84 Mcps and 7.68 Mcps options
==================================================================================================

In the case of the 3.84 Mcps option, clause 4 applies only for
non-MBSFN-IMB operation. Multiplexing, channel coding and interleaving
for 3.84 Mcps MBSFN IMB operation is described in sub-clause 5.

4.1 General
-----------

Data stream from/to MAC and higher layers (Transport block / Transport
block set) is encoded/decoded to offer transport services over the radio
transmission link. Channel coding scheme is a combination of error
detection, error correcting (including rate matching), and interleaving
and transport channels mapping onto/splitting from physical channels.

In the UTRA-TDD mode for the 1.28 Mcps, 3.84 Mcps and 7.68 Mcps options,
the total number of basic physical channels (a certain time slot one
spreading code on a certain carrier frequency) per frame is given by the
maximum number of time slots and the maximum number of CDMA codes per
time slot.

4.2 General coding/multiplexing of TrCHs
----------------------------------------

This section only applies to the transport channels: DCH, RACH, DSCH,
USCH, BCH, FACH and PCH. Other transport channels which do not use the
general method are described separately below.

Figure 1 illustrates the overall concept of transport-channel coding and
multiplexing. Data arrives to the coding/multiplexing unit in form of
transport block sets, once every transmission time interval. The
transmission time interval is transport-channel specific from the set {5
ms^(\*1)^, 10 ms, 20 ms, 40 ms, 80 ms}.

Note: ^(\*1)^ may be applied for PRACH for 1.28 Mcps TDD

The following coding/multiplexing steps can be identified:

\- add CRC to each transport block (see subclause 4.2.1);

\- TrBk concatenation / Code block segmentation (see subclause 4.2.2);

\- channel coding (see subclause 4.2.3) ;

\- radio frame size equalization (see subclause 4.2.4);

\- interleaving (two steps, see subclauses 4.2.5 and 4.2.11 );

\- radio frame segmentation (see subclause 4.2.6);

\- rate matching (see subclause 4.2.7);

\- multiplexing of transport channels (see subclause 4.2.8);

\- bit scrambling (see subclause 4.2.9);

\- physical channel segmentation (see subclause 4.2.10);

\- sub-frame segmentation(see subclause 4.2.11A only for 1.28Mcps TDD)

\- mapping to physical channels (see subclause 4.2.12).

The coding/multiplexing steps for uplink and downlink are shown in
figures 1 and 1A.

Figure 1: Transport channel multiplexing structure for uplink and
downlink for 3.84Mcps and 7.68 Mcps TDD

Figure 1A: Transport channel multiplexing structure for uplink and
downlink of 1.28Mcps TDD

Primarily, transport channels are multiplexed as described above, i.e.
into one data stream mapped on one or several physical channels.
However, an alternative way of multiplexing services is to use multiple
CCTrCHs (Coded Composite Transport Channels), which corresponds to
having several parallel multiplexing chains as in figures 1 and 1A,
resulting in several data streams, each mapped to one or several
physical channels.

### 4.2.1 CRC attachment

Error detection is provided on transport blocks through a Cyclic
Redundancy Check (CRC). The size of the CRC is 24, 16, 12, 8 or 0 bits
and it is signalled from higher layers what CRC size that should be used
for each transport channel.

#### 4.2.1.1 CRC calculation

The entire transport block is used to calculate the CRC parity bits for
each transport block. The parity bits are generated by one of the
following cyclic generator polynomials:

g~CRC24~(*D*) = *D*^24^ + *D*^23^ + *D*^6^ + *D*^5^ + *D* + 1

g~CRC16~(*D*) = *D*^16^ + *D*^12^ + *D*^5^ + 1

g~CRC12~(*D*) = *D*^12^ + *D*^11^ + *D*^3^ + *D*^2^ + *D* + 1

g~CRC8~(*D*) = *D*^8^ + *D*^7^ + *D*^4^ + *D*^3^ + *D* + 1

Denote the bits in a transport block delivered to layer 1 by
![](media/image4.wmf){width="1.5138888888888888in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"}, and the parity bits by
![](media/image5.wmf){width="1.5138888888888888in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"}. *A~i~* is the size of a transport block
of TrCH *i, m* is the transport block number, and *L~i~* is the number
of parity bits. *L~i~* can take the values 24, 16, 12, 8, or 0 depending
on what is signalled from higher layers.

The encoding is performed in a systematic form, which means that in
GF(2), the polynomial:

![](media/image6.wmf){width="5.375in" height="0.2777777777777778in"}

yields a remainder equal to 0 when divided by g~CRC24~(*D*), polynomial:

![](media/image7.wmf){width="5.166666666666667in"
height="0.2777777777777778in"}

yields a remainder equal to 0 when divided by g~CRC16~(*D*), polynomial:

![](media/image8.wmf){width="5.277777777777778in"
height="0.2777777777777778in"}

yields a remainder equal to 0 when divided by g~CRC12~(*D*) and the
polynomial:

![](media/image9.wmf){width="4.888888888888889in"
height="0.2777777777777778in"}

yields a remainder equal to 0 when divided by g~CRC8~(*D*).

If no transport blocks are input to the CRC calculation (*M~i\ ~*= 0),
no CRC attachment shall be done. If transport blocks are input to the
CRC calculation (*M~i\ ~*≠ 0) and the size of a transport block is zero
(*A~i\ ~*= 0), CRC shall be attached, i.e. all parity bits equal to
zero.

#### 4.2.1.2 Relation between input and output of the CRC attachment block

The bits after CRC attachment are denoted by
![](media/image10.wmf){width="1.3888888888888888in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"}, where *B~i~* = *A~i~* + *L~i~*. The
relation between *a~imk~* and *b~imk~* is:

![](media/image11.wmf){width="0.6805555555555556in" height="0.25in"} *k*
= 1, 2, 3, ..., *A~i~*

![](media/image12.wmf){width="1.3055555555555556in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"} *k* = *A~i~* + 1, *A~i~* + 2, *A~i~* + 3,
..., *A~i~* + *L~i~*

### 4.2.2 Transport block concatenation and code block segmentation

All transport blocks in a TTI are serially concatenated. If the number
of bits in a TTI is larger than the maximum size of a code block, then
code block segmentation is performed after the concatenation of the
transport blocks. The maximum size of the code blocks depends on whether
convolutional, turbo coding or no coding is used for the TrCH.

#### 4.2.2.1 Concatenation of transport blocks

The bits input to the transport block concatenation are denoted by
![](media/image13.wmf){width="1.3888888888888888in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"} where *i* is the TrCH number, *m* is the
transport block number, and *B~i~* is the number of bits in each block
(including CRC). The number of transport blocks on TrCH *i* is denoted
by *M~i~*. The bits after concatenation are denoted by
![](media/image14.wmf){width="1.1666666666666667in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"}, where *i* is the TrCH number and
*X~i~=M~i~B~i~*. They are defined by the following relations:

(*M~i~* -- 1)*B~i~* *+* 2*, ..., M~i~B~i~*

#### 4.2.2.2 Code block segmentation

Segmentation of the bit sequence from transport block concatenation is
performed if *X~i~\>Z*. The code blocks after segmentation are of the
same size. The number of code blocks on TrCH *i* is denoted by *C~i~*.
If the number of bits input to the segmentation, *X~i~*, is not a
multiple of *C~i~*, filler bits are added to the beginning of the first
block. If turbo coding is selected and *X~i~* \< 40, filler bits are
added to the beginning of the code block. The filler bits are
transmitted and they are always set to 0. The maximum code block sizes
are:

\- convolutional coding: *Z* = 504;

\- turbo coding: *Z* = 5114;

\- no channel coding: *Z = unlimited*.

The bits output from code block segmentation, for *C~i~* ≠ 0, are
denoted by ![](media/image20.wmf){width="1.3194444444444444in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"}, where *i* is the TrCH number, *r* is the
code block number, and *K~i~* is the number of bits per code block.

Number of code blocks:

![](media/image21.wmf){width="3.2083333333333335in"
height="0.7777777777777778in"}

Number of bits in each code block (applicable for *C~i~* ≠ 0 only):

if *X~i~* \< 40 and Turbo coding is used, then

*K~i~* = 40

else

*K~i~ = X~i~ / C~i~*

end if

Number of filler bits: *Y~i~ = C~i~K~i~ -- X~i~*

end while

### 4.2.3 Channel coding

Code blocks are delivered to the channel coding block. They are denoted
by ![](media/image25.wmf){width="1.3194444444444444in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"}, where *i* is the TrCH number, *r* is the
code block number, and *K~i~* is the number of bits in each code block.
The number of code blocks on TrCH *i* is denoted by *C~i~*. After
encoding the bits are denoted by
![](media/image26.wmf){width="1.4305555555555556in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"}, where *Y~i~* is the number of encoded
bits. The relation between *o~irk~* and *y~irk~* and between *K~i~* and
*Y~i~* is dependent on the channel coding scheme.

The following channel coding schemes can be applied to transport
channels:

\- convolutional coding;

\- turbo coding;

\- no coding.

Usage of coding scheme and coding rate for the different types of TrCH
is shown in tables 1 and 1A. The values of *Y~i~* in connection with
each coding scheme:

\- convolutional coding with rate 1/2: *Y~i~* = 2\**K~i~* + 16; rate
1/3: *Y~i~* = 3\**K~i~* + 24;

\- turbo coding with rate 1/3: *Y~i~* = 3\**K~i~* + 12;

\- no coding: Y~i~ = K~i~.

Note: Rate 1/3 Turbo coding is only applied to BCH when the beacon
timeslot uses burst type 4; rate 1/2 convolutional coding is only
applied to BCH when the beacon timeslot uses burst type 1. For the MBSFN
FACH, only rate 1/3 Turbo coding shall be applied.

#### 4.2.3.1 Convolutional coding

0,...,output 2. Output from the rate 1/2 convolutional coder shall be

Figure 2: Rate 1/2 and rate 1/3 convolutional coders

#### 4.2.3.2 Turbo coding

##### 4.2.3.2.1 Turbo coder

The scheme of Turbo coder is a Parallel Concatenated Convolutional Code
(PCCC) with two 8-state constituent encoders and one Turbo code internal
interleaver. The coding rate of Turbo coder is 1/3. The structure of
Turbo coder is illustrated in figure 3.

The transfer function of the 8-state constituent code for PCCC is:

G(D)= ![](media/image28.wmf){width="0.69375in"
height="0.5555555555555556in"},

where

*g*~0~(*D*) = 1 + *D*^2^ + *D*^3^,

*g*~1~ (*D*) = 1 + *D* + *D*^3^.

The initial value of the shift registers of the 8-state constituent
encoders shall be all zeros when starting to encode the input bits.

Output from the Turbo coder is , Y\'(0), X(1), Y(1), Y\'(1), etc:

*x*~1~, *z*~1~, *z*\'~1~, *x*~2~, *z*~2~, *z*\'~2~, ..., *x~K~*, *z~K~*,
*z*\'*~K~*,

where *x*~1~, *x*~2~, ..., *x~K~* are the bits input to the Turbo coder
i.e. both first 8-state constituent encoder and Turbo code internal
interleaver, and *K* is the number of bits, and *z*~1~, *z*~2~, ...,
*z~K~* and *z*\'~1~, *z*\'~2~, ..., *z*\'*~K~* are the bits output from
first and second 8-state constituent encoders, respectively.

The bits output from Turbo code internal interleaver are denoted by
*x*\'~1~, *x*\'~2~, ..., *x*\'*~K~*, and these bits are to be input to
the second 8-state constituent encoder.

Figure 3: Structure of rate 1/3 Turbo coder (dotted lines apply for
trellis termination only)

##### 4.2.3.2.2 Trellis termination for Turbo coder

Trellis termination is performed by taking the tail bits from the shift
register feedback after all information bits are encoded. Tail bits are
padded after the encoding of information bits.

The first three tail bits shall be used to terminate the first
constituent encoder (upper switch of figure 3 in lower position) while
the second constituent encoder is disabled. The last three tail bits
shall be used to terminate the second constituent encoder (lower switch
of figure 3 in lower position) while the first constituent encoder is
disabled.

The transmitted bits for trellis termination shall then be:

*x~K~*~+1~, *z~K~*~+1~, *x~K~*~+2~, *z~K~*~+2~, *x~K~*~+3~, *z~K~*~+3~,
*x*\'~*K*+1~, *z*\'~*K*+1~, *x*\'~*K*+2~, *z*\'~*K*+2~, *x*\'~*K*+3~,
*z*\'~*K*+3~.

##### 4.2.3.2.3 Turbo code internal interleaver

The Turbo code internal interleaver consists of bits-input to a
rectangular matrix with padding, intra-row and inter-row permutations of
the rectangular matrix, and bits-output from the rectangular matrix with
pruning. The bits input to the Turbo code internal interleaver are
denoted by ![](media/image30.wmf){width="1.0416666666666667in"

channel coding is defined by

###### 4.2.3.2.3.1 Bits-input to rectangular matrix with padding

The bit sequence ![](media/image30.wmf){width="1.0416666666666667in"
height="0.25in"} input to the Turbo code internal interleaver is written
into the rectangular matrix as follows.

\(1\) Determine the number of rows of the rectangular matrix, *R*, such
that:

![](media/image36.wmf){width="2.888888888888889in"
height="0.6666666666666666in"}.

The rows of rectangular matrix are numbered 0, 1, ..., *R* - 1 from top
to bottom.

\(2\) Determine the prime number to be used in the intra-permutation,
*p*, and the number of columns of rectangular matrix, *C*, such that:

if (481 ![](media/image31.wmf){width="0.1388888888888889in"
height="0.16666666666666666in"} *K*
![](media/image31.wmf){width="0.1388888888888889in"
height="0.16666666666666666in"} 530) then

*p = 53* and *C* = *p*.

else

Find minimum prime number *p* from table 2 such that

![](media/image37.wmf){width="0.875in" height="0.20833333333333334in"},

and determine *C* such that

![](media/image38.wmf){width="2.3194444444444446in"
height="0.6527777777777778in"}.

end if

The columns of rectangular matrix are numbered 0, 1, ..., *C* - 1 from
left to right.

##### 4.2.3.2.3.3 Bits-output from rectangular matrix with pruning {#bits-output-from-rectangular-matrix-with-pruning .H6}

After intra-row and inter-row permutations, the bits of the permuted
rectangular matrix are denoted by *y*\'*~k~*:

![](media/image49.wmf){width="2.3194444444444446in" height="0.875in"}

The output of the Turbo code internal interleaver is the bit sequence
read out column by column from the intra-row and inter-row permuted *R*
![](media/image50.wmf){width="0.125in" height="0.125in"} *C* rectangular
matrix starting with bit *y*\'~1~ in row 0 of column 0 and ending with
bit *y*\'*~CR~* in row *R* - 1 of column *C* - 1. The output is pruned
by deleting dummy bits that were padded to the input of the rectangular
matrix before intra-row and inter row permutations, i.e. bits *y*\'*~k~*
that corresponds to bits *y~k~* with *k \> K* are removed from the
output. The bits output from Turbo code internal interleaver are denoted
by *x*\'~1~, *x*\'~2~, ..., *x*\'*~K~*, where *x*\'~1~ corresponds to
the bit *y*\'*~k~* with smallest index *k* after pruning, *x*\'~2~ to
the bit *y*\'*~k~* with second smallest index *k* after pruning, and so
on. The number of bits output from Turbo code internal interleaver is
*K* and the total number of pruned bits is:

#### 4.2.3.3 Concatenation of encoded blocks

After the channel coding for each code block, if *C~i~* is greater than

lowest index *r* is output first from the channel coding block,
otherwise the encoded block is output from channel coding block as it

If no code blocks are input to the channel coding (*C~i~* = 0), no bits
shall be output from the channel coding, i.e. *E~i~* = 0.

### 4.2.4 Radio frame size equalisation

Radio frame size equalisation is padding the input bit sequence in order
to ensure that the output can be segmented in *F~i~* data segments of
same size as described in the subclause 4.2.6.

number of bits. Here *X~i~* is guaranteed to be an integer multiple of
the number of radio frames in the TTI. The output bit sequence from the
block interleaver is derived as follows:

The columns are numbered 0, 1, ..., C1 - 1 from left to right.

#### 4.2.5.1 Relation between input and output of 1^st^ interleaving

The bits input to the 1^st^ interleaving are denoted by
![](media/image68.wmf){width="1.1527777777777777in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"}, where *i* is the TrCH number and *T~i~*
the number of bits. Hence, *x~i,k~* *=* *t~i,k~* and *X~i~* *=* *T~i~*.

The bits output from the 1^st^ interleaving are denoted by
![](media/image69.wmf){width="1.3333333333333333in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"}, and *d~i,k~* = *y~i,k~*.

### 4.2.6 Radio frame segmentation

When the transmission time interval is longer than 10 ms, the input bit
sequence is segmented and mapped onto consecutive *F~i~* radio frames.
Following radio frame size equalisation the input bit sequence length is
guaranteed to be an integer multiple of *F~i~*.

The input bit sequence is denoted by
![](media/image70.wmf){width="1.1666666666666667in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"} where *i* is the TrCH number and *X~i~*
is the number bits. The *F~i~* output bit sequences per TTI are denoted
by ![](media/image71.wmf){width="1.6666666666666667in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"}where *n~i~* is the radio frame number in
current TTI and *Y~i~* is the number of bits per radio frame for TrCH
*i*. The output sequences are defined as follows:

![](media/image72.wmf){width="0.3333333333333333in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"}=
![](media/image73.wmf){width="0.7083333333333334in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"}, *n~i~* = 1...*F~i~*, *k* = 1...*Y~i~*

where

*Y~i~* = (*X~i~* / *F~i~*) is the number of bits per segment.

The *n~i~* --th segment is mapped to the *n~i~* --th radio frame of the
transmission time interval.

The input bit sequence to the radio frame segmentation is denoted by
![](media/image74.wmf){width="1.2361111111111112in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"}, where *i* is the TrCH number and *T~i~*
the number of bits. Hence, *x~ik~ = d~ik~* and *X~i~ = T~i~*.

The output bit sequence corresponding to radio frame *n~i~* is denoted
by ![](media/image75.wmf){width="1.125in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"}, where *i* is the TrCH number and *N~i~*
is the number of bits. Hence,
![](media/image76.wmf){width="0.7083333333333334in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"}and *N~i~ = Y~i~*.

### 4.2.7 Rate matching

Rate matching means that bits on a TrCH are repeated or punctured.
Higher layers assign a rate-matching attribute for each TrCH. This
attribute is semi-static and can only be changed through higher layer
signalling. The rate-matching attribute is used when the number of bits
to be repeated or punctured is calculated.

The number of bits on a TrCH can vary between different transmission
time intervals. When the number of bits between different transmission
time intervals is changed, bits are repeated to ensure that the total
bit rate after TrCH multiplexing is identical to the total channel bit
rate of the allocated physical channels.

If no bits are input to the rate matching for all TrCHs within a CCTrCH,
the rate matching shall output no bits for all TrCHs within the CCTrCH.

Notation used in subclause 4.2.7 and subclauses:

*N~ij~* : Number of bits in a radio frame before rate matching on TrCH
*i* with transport format combination *j*.

> ![](media/image77.wmf){width="0.3576388888888889in"

*RM~i~* : Semi-static rate matching attribute for TrCH *i*. Signalled
from higher layers.

> *PL* : Puncturing limit. This value limits the amount of puncturing

>
> *N~data,j~* : Total number of bits that are available for a CCTrCH in

*P* : number of physical channels used in the current frame.

*P~max~* : maximum number of physical channels allocated for a CCTrCH.

*U~p~* : Number of data bits in the physical channel p with p = 1\...P
during a radio frame.

*I* : Number of TrCHs in a CCTrCH.

*Z~ij~* : Intermediate calculation variable.

*F~i~* : Number of radio frames in the transmission time interval of
TrCH *i*.

*n~i~* : Radio frame number in the transmission time interval of TrCH
*i* (*0 ≤ n~i~ \< F~i~*).

> *q* : Average puncturing or repetition distance(normalised to only

> that P1~F~ self-inverse).

S\[n\] : The shift of the puncturing or repetition pattern for radio
frame n~i~ when ![](media/image78.wmf){width="0.8465277777777778in"

*TF~i~*(*j*) : Transport format of TrCH i for the transport format
combination j.

*TFS*(*i*) : The set of transport format indexes *l* for TrCH i.

*e~plus~* : Increment of variable *e* in the rate matching pattern
determination algorithm of subclause 4.2.7.3.

*e~minus~* : Decrement of variable *e* in the rate matching pattern

> *b*=3: 2^nd^ parity bit (from the lower Turbo constituent encoder).
> *Y\'(t)* in subclause 4.2.3.2.1.

Note: when the TTI is 5msec for 1.28Mcps, the above notation refers to a
sub-frame rather than a radio frame. In this case, *F~i~* = 1 and *n~i~*
= 0.

#### 4.2.7.1 Determination of rate matching parameters

The following relations, defined for all TFC *j*, are used when
calculating the rate matching pattern:

![](media/image79.wmf){width="0.5555555555555556in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"}

![](media/image80.wmf){width="2.4805555555555556in"
height="0.9423611111111111in"} for all i = 1 \... *I* (1)

![](media/image81.wmf){width="1.69375in" height="0.2638888888888889in"}
for all i = 1 \... *I*

Puncturing can be used to minimise the required transmission capacity.
The maximum amount of puncturing that can be applied is 1-PL, PL is
signalled from higher layers. The possible values for N~data~ depend on
the number of physical channels P~max~ , allocated to the respective
CCTrCH, and on their characteristics (spreading factor, length of
midamble and TFCI code word, usage of TPC and multiframe structure),
which is given in \[7\].

For each physical channel an individual minimum spreading factor
*Sp~min~* is transmitted by means of the higher layers. Denote the
number of data bits in each physical channel by *U~p,Sp~* , where *p*
*indicates* the sequence number *1≤ p≤ P~max~* and *Sp* indicates the
spreading factor of this physical channel: *Sp* takes the possible
values {*16, 8, 4, 2, 1*} for 1.28Mcps TDD and 3.84Mcps TDD, *Sp* takes
the possible values {32, *16, 8, 4, 2, 1*} for 7.68Mcps TDD. The index
*p* is described in section 4.2.12 with the following modifications:
spreading factor (*Q*) is replaced by the minimum spreading factor
*Sp~min~* and *k* is replaced by the channelization code index at *Q=
Sp~min~*. Then, for *N~data~* one of the following values in ascending
order can be chosen:

![](media/image82.wmf){width="3.3930555555555557in"
height="0.2326388888888889in"}

Optionally, if indicated by higher layers for the UL the UE shall vary
the spreading factor autonomously, so that *N~data~* is one of the
following values in ascending order:

![](media/image83.wmf){width="6.605555555555555in"
height="0.2326388888888889in"}

N~data,\ j~ for the transport format combination j is determined by
executing the following algorithm:

SET1 = { N~data~ such that
![](media/image84.wmf){width="3.307638888888889in"
height="0.5513888888888889in"} is non negative }

N~data,\ j~ = min SET1

The number of bits to be repeated or punctured, ∆*N~i,j~*, within one
radio frame (one sub-frame when the TTI is 5msec) for each TrCH i is
calculated with the relations given at the beginning of this subclause
for all possible transport format combinations j and selected every
radio frame (sub-frame). The number of physical channels corresponding
to N~data,\ j,~ shall be denoted by P.

If ∆*N~i,j~* = 0 then the output data of the rate matching is the same
as the input data and the rate matching algorithm of subclause 4.2.7.3
does not need to be executed.

Otherwise, the rate matching pattern is calculated with the algorithm
described in subclause 4.2.7.3. For this algorithm the parameters
e~ini~, e~plus~, e~minus~, and *X~i~* are needed, which are calculated
according to the equations in subclauses 4.2.7.1.1 and 4.2.7.1.2.

#### 4.2.7.2 Bit separation and collection for rate matching

The systematic bits of turbo encoded TrCHs shall not be punctured, the
other bits may be punctured. The systematic bits, first parity bits, and
second parity bits in the bit sequence input to the rate matching block
are therefore separated into three sequences.

The first sequence contains:

\- All of the systematic bits that are from turbo encoded TrCHs.

\- From 0 to 2 first and/or second parity bits that are from turbo
encoded TrCHs. These bits come into the first sequence when the total
number of bits in a block after radio frame segmentation is not a
multiple of three.

\- Some of the systematic, first parity and second parity bits that are
for trellis termination.

The second sequence contains:

\- All of the first parity bits that are from turbo encoded TrCHs,
except those that go into the first sequence when the total number of
bits is not a multiple of three.

\- Some of the systematic, first parity and second parity bits that are
for trellis termination.

The third sequence contains:

\- All of the second parity bits that are from turbo encoded TrCHs,
except those that go into the first sequence when the total number of
bits is not a multiple of three.

\- Some of the systematic, first parity and second parity bits that are
for trellis termination.

The second and third sequences shall be of equal length, whereas the
first sequence can contain from 0 to 2 more bits. Puncturing is applied
only to the second and third sequences.

The bit separation function is transparent for uncoded TrCHs,
convolutionally encoded TrCHs, and for turbo encoded TrCHs with
repetition. The bit separation and bit collection are illustrated in
figures 4 and 5.

The bit separation is dependent on the 1^st^ interleaving and offsets
are used to define the separation for different TTIs. *b* indicates the
three sequences defined in this section, with *b*=1 indicating the first
sequence, *b* = 2 the second one, and *b* = 3 the third one.

The offsets *α~b~* for these sequences are listed in table 5.

are denoted ![](media/image98.wmf){width="1.6388888888888888in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"}.

Bit collection is the inverse function of the separation. The bits after
collection are denoted by
![](media/image99.wmf){width="1.5694444444444444in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"}. After bit collection, the bits indicated
as punctured are removed and the bits are then denoted by
![](media/image100.wmf){width="1.3055555555555556in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"}, where *i* is the TrCH number and *V~i~*
= *N~i,j~*+∆*N~i,j~*. The relations between *y~b,i,k~,* *z~b,i,k~*, and
*f~i,k~* are given below.

For turbo encoded TrCHs with puncturing (*Y~i~=X~i~*):

![](media/image101.wmf){width="1.7083333333333333in"

*k* = 1, 2, 3, ..., *Y~i~*

After the bit collection, bits *z~i,k~* with value *δ*, where
*δ[∉]{.underline}*{0, 1}, are removed from the bit sequence. Bit
*f~i,~*~1~ corresponds to the bit *z~i,k~* with smallest index *k* after
puncturing, bit *f~i,~*~2~ corresponds to the bit *z~i,k~* with second
smallest index *k* after puncturing, and so on.

When puncturing is used, *Y~i~*=*X~i~* and bits *z~i,k~* with value *δ*,
where *δ∉*{0, 1}, are removed from the bit sequence. Bit *f~i,~*~1~
corresponds to the bit *z~i,k~* with smallest index *k* after
puncturing, bit *f~i,~*~2~ corresponds to the bit *z~i,k~* with second

#### 4.2.7.3 Rate matching pattern determination

The bits input to the rate matching are denoted by
![](media/image106.wmf){width="1.3194444444444444in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"}, where *i* is the TrCH and *X*~i~ is the
parameter given in subclauses 4.2.7.1.1 and 4.2.7.1.2*.*

NOTE: The transport format combination number j for simplicity has been
left out in the bit numbering.

The rate matching rule is as follows:

if puncturing is to be performed

*e* = *e~ini~* \-- initial error between current and desired puncturing
ratio

m = 1 \-- index of current bit

do while m \<= *X~i~*

*e* = *e* -- *e~minus~* \-- update error

if e \<= 0 then \-- check if bit number m should be punctured

set bit *x~i,m~* to *δ* where *δ∉*{0, 1}

*e* = *e* + *e~plus~* \-- update error

end if

m = m + 1 \-- next bit

end do

else

e = *e~ini~* \-- initial error between current and desired puncturing
ratio

m = 1 \-- index of current bit

do while m \<= *X~i~*

*e* = *e* -- *e~minus~* \-- update error

do while e \<= 0 \-- check if bit number m should be repeated

repeat bit *x~i,m~*

*e* = *e* + *e~plus~* \-- update error

end do

m = m + 1 \-- next bit

end do

end if

A repeated bit is placed directly after the original one.

### 4.2.8 TrCH multiplexing

Every 10 ms, one radio frame from each TrCH is delivered to the TrCH
multiplexing. These radio frames are serially multiplexed into a coded
composite transport channel (CCTrCH). If the TTI is smaller than 10ms,
then no TrCH multiplexing is performed.

height="0.20833333333333334in"}, where *S* is the number of bits input
to the bit scrambling block equal to the total number of bits on the
CCTrCH. The bits after bit scrambling are denoted
![](media/image115.wmf){width="0.94375in" height="0.25in"}.

Bit scrambling is defined by the following relation:

### 4.2.10 Physical channel segmentation

When more than one PhCH is used, physical channel segmentation divides
the bits among the different PhCHs. The bits input to the physical
channel segmentation are denoted by
![](media/image115.wmf){width="0.94375in" height="0.25in"}, where S is
the number of bits input to the physical channel segmentation block. The

### 4.2.11 2nd interleaving

The 2^nd^ interleaving is a block interleaver and consists of bits input
to a matrix with padding, the inter-column permutation for the matrix
and bits output from the matrix with pruning. The 2nd interleaving can
be applied jointly to all data bits transmitted during one frame, or
separately within each timeslot, on which the CCTrCH is mapped. The
selection of the 2nd interleaving scheme is controlled by higher layer.

### 4.2.11A Sub-frame segmentation for the 1.28 Mcps option

In the 1.28Mcps TDD, it is needed to add a sub-frame segmentation unit
between 2nd interleaving unit and physical channel mapping unit when the
TTI of the CCTrCh is greater than 5msec. In this case, the operation of
rate-matching guarantees that the size of bit streams is an even number
and can be subdivided into 2 sub-frames. The transport channel
multiplexing structure for uplink and downlink is shown in figure 1A.

The input to the sub-frame segmentation unit is segmented into timeslot
chunks, where each timeslot chunk contains all of the bits that are to
be transmitted in a given timeslot position in both of the sub-frames.

The input bit sequence is denoted by
![](media/image154.wmf){width="1.1666666666666667in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"} where i is the timeslot number and X~i~
is the number of bits transmitted in timeslot i in a radio frame. The
two output bit sequences per radio frame are denoted by *y~i,n,1~,
y~i,n,2~, y~i,n,3~, ..., y~i,n,Yi~* where n is the sub-frame number in
current radio frame and Y~i~ is the number of bits per sub-frame for
timeslot i. The output sequences are defined as follows:

$y_{i,n,k}$= $x_{i,((n - 1)\text{.}Y_{i}) + k}$, n = 1 or 2, k =
1...Y~i~

where

Y~i~ = (X~i~ / 2) is the number of bits in timeslot i per sub-frame,

![](media/image155.wmf){width="0.20833333333333334in" height="0.25in"}
is the k^th^ bit of the input bit sequence and

$y_{i,n,k}$is the k^th^ bit of the output bit sequence corresponding to
the n^th^ sub-frame

### 4.2.12 Physical channel mapping

#### 4.2.12.1 Physical channel mapping for the 3.84 Mcps and 7.68Mcps options

The PhCH for both uplink and downlink is defined in \[7\]. The bits
after physical channel mapping are denoted by
![](media/image156.wmf){width="1.25in" height="0.2777777777777778in"},
where *p* is the PhCH number corresponding to the sequence number *1≤ p≤
P* of this physical channel as detailed below, *U~p~* is the number of
bits in one radio frame for the respective PhCH, and *P≤*. *P~max~*. The
bits w*~p,k~* are mapped to the PhCHs so that the bits for each PhCH are
transmitted over the air in ascending order with respect to *k*.

The physical layer shall assign the physical channel sequence number *p*
to the physical channels of the CCTrCH in the respective radio frame,
treating each allocated timeslot in ascending order. If within a
timeslot there are multiple physical channels they shall first be
ordered in ascending order of the spreading factor (*Q*) and
subsequently by channelisation code index (*k*), as shown in \[9\].

The mapping of the bits
$v_{t,1},v_{t,2},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},v_{t,U_{t}}$ is performed like
block interleaving, writing the bits into columns, but a PhCH with an
odd number is filled in forward order, whereas a PhCH with an even
number is filled in reverse order.

The mapping scheme, as described in the following subclause, shall be
applied individually for each timeslot *t* used in the current frame.
Therefore, the bits ![](media/image157.wmf){width="0.9861111111111112in"
height="0.2638888888888889in"} are assigned to the bits of the physical
channels ![](media/image158.wmf){width="1.94375in"
height="0.2916666666666667in"} in each timeslot.

In uplink there are at most two codes allocated (P≤2). If there is only
one code, the same mapping as for downlink is applied. Denote SF1 and
SF2 the spreading factors used for code 1 and 2, respectively. For the
number of consecutive bits to assign per code bs*~k~* the following rule
is applied:

if

SF1 \>= SF2 then bs~1~ = 1 ; bs~2~ = SF1/SF2 ;

else

SF2 \> SF1 then bs~1~ = SF2/SF1; bs~2~ = 1 ;

end if

In the downlink case bs~p~ is 1 for all physical channels.

#### 4.2.12.2 Physical channel mapping for the 1.28 Mcps option

The bit streams from the sub-frame segmentation unit are mapped onto
code channels of time slots in sub-frames.

The bits after physical channel mapping are denoted by , where p is the
PhCH number and Up is the number of bits in one sub-frame for the
respective PhCH. The bits wpk are mapped to the PhCHs so that the bits
for each PhCH are transmitted over the air in ascending order with
respect to k.

The mapping of the bits y~t,n,1~, y~t,n,2,~ y~t,n,3,\ ...,~ y~t,n,Ut~ is
performed like block interleaving, writing the bits into columns, but a
PhCH with an odd number is filled in forward order, were as a PhCH with
an even number is filled in reverse order.

The mapping scheme, as described in the following subclause, shall be
applied individually for each timeslot t used in the current subframe.
Therefore, the bits y~t,n,1~, y~t,n,2,~ y~t,n,3,\ ...,~ y~t,n,Ut~ are
assigned to the bits of the physical channels
![](media/image160.wmf){width="1.69375in" height="0.25in"} in each
timeslot.

In uplink there are at most two codes allocated (P≤2). If there is only
one code, the same mapping as for downlink is applied. Denote SF1 and
SF2 the spreading factors used for code 1 and 2, respectively. For the
number of consecutive bits to assign per code bsk the following rule is
applied:

SF1 \>= SF2 then bs~1~ = 1 ; bs~2~ = SF1/SF2 ;

else

SF2 \> SF1 then bs~1~ = SF2/SF1; bs~2~ = 1 ;

### 4.2.13 Multiplexing of different transport channels onto one CCTrCH, and mapping of one CCTrCH onto physical channels

Different transport channels can be encoded and multiplexed together
into one Coded Composite Transport Channel (CCTrCH). The following rules
shall apply to the different transport channels which are part of the
same CCTrCH:

1\) Transport channels multiplexed into one CCTrCh shall have
co-ordinated timings. When the TFCS of a CCTrCH is changed because one
or more transport channels are added to the CCTrCH or reconfigured
within the CCTrCH, or removed from the CCTrCH, the change may only be
made at the start of a radio frame with CFN fulfilling the relation

> CFN mod F~max~ = 0,
>
> where F~max~ denotes the maximum number of radio frames within the
> transmission time intervals of all transport channels which are
> multiplexed into the same CCTrCH, including any transport channels *i*
> which are added reconfigured or have been removed, and CFN denotes the
> connection frame number of the first radio frame of the changed
> CCTrCH.
>
> After addition or reconfiguration of a transport channel *i* within a
> CCTrCH, the TTI of transport channel *i* may only start in radio
> frames with CFN fulfilling the relation
>
> CFN~i~ mod F~i~ = 0.

2\) Different CCTrCHs cannot be mapped onto the same physical channel.

3\) One CCTrCH shall be mapped onto one or several physical channels.

4\) Dedicated Transport channels and common transport channels cannot be
multiplexed into the same CCTrCH.

5\) For the common transport channels, only the FACH and PCH may belong
to the same CCTrCH.

6\) Each CCTrCH carrying a BCH shall carry only one BCH and shall not
carry any other Transport Channel.

7\) Each CCTrCH carrying a RACH shall carry only one RACH and shall not
carry any other Transport Channel.

Hence, there are two types of CCTrCH.

CCTrCH of dedicated type, corresponding to the result of coding and
multiplexing of one or several DCH.

CCTrCH of common type, corresponding to the result of the coding and
multiplexing of a common channel, i.e. RACH and USCH in the uplink and
DSCH, BCH, FACH or PCH in the downlink, respectively.

Transmission of TFCI is possible for CCTrCH containing Transport
Channels of:

\- dedicated type;

\- USCH type;

\- DSCH type;

\- FACH and/or PCH type.

#### 4.2.13.1 Allowed CCTrCH combinations for one UE

##### 4.2.13.1.1 Allowed CCTrCH combinations on the uplink

The following CCTrCH combinations for one UE are allowed, also
simultaneously:

1\) several CCTrCH of dedicated type;

2\) several CCTrCH of common type.

##### 4.2.13.1.2 Allowed CCTrCH combinations on the downlink

The following CCTrCH combinations for one UE are allowed, also
simultaneously:

3\) several CCTrCH of dedicated type;

4\) several CCTrCH of common type.

### 4.2.14 Transport format detection

Transport format detection can be performed both with and without
Transport Format Combination Indicator (TFCI). If a TFCI is transmitted,
the receiver detects the transport format combination from the TFCI.
When no TFCI is transmitted, so called blind transport format detection
may be used, i.e. the receiver side uses the possible transport format
combinations as a priori information.

#### 4.2.14.1 Blind transport format detection

Blind Transport Format Detection is optional both in the UE and the
UTRAN. Therefore, for all CCTrCH a TFCI shall be transmitted, including
the possibility of a TFCI code word length zero, if only one TFC is
defined.

#### 4.2.14.2 Explicit transport format detection based on TFCI

##### 4.2.14.2.1 Transport Format Combination Indicator (TFCI)

The Transport Format Combination Indicator (TFCI) informs the receiver
of the transport format combination of the CCTrCHs. As soon as the TFCI
is detected, the transport format combination, and hence the individual
transport channels\' transport formats are known, and decoding of the
transport channels can be performed.

4.3 Coding for layer 1 control for the 3.84 Mcps and 7.68Mcps TDD options
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 4.3.1 Coding of transport format combination indicator (TFCI)

Encoding of the TFCI depends on its length. If there are 6-10 bits of
TFCI the channel encoding is done as described in subclause 4.3.1.1.
Also specific coding of less than 6 bits is possible as explained in
subclause 4.3.1.2.

#### 4.3.1.1 Coding of long TFCI lengths

The TFCI is encoded using a (32, 10) sub-code of the second order
Reed-Muller code. The coding procedure is as shown in figure 6.

![](media/image161.wmf){width="4.759722222222222in"
height="0.7951388888888888in"}

Figure 6: Channel coding of the TFCI bits

If the TFCI consists of less than 10 bits, it is padded with zeros to 10
bits, by setting the most significant bits to zero. TFCI is encoded by
the (32,10) sub-code of second order Reed-Muller code. The code words of
the (32,10) sub-code of second order Reed-Muller code are linear
combination of some among 10 basis sequences. The basis sequences are as
follows in table 8.

The TFCI bits a~0~ , a~1~ , a~2~ , a~3~ , a~4~ , a~5~ , a~6~ , a~7~ ,
a~8~ , a~9~ (where a~0~ is LSB and a~9~ is MSB) shall correspond to the
TFC index (expressed in unsigned binary form) defined by the RRC layer
to reference the TFC of the CCTrCH in the associated radio frame.

The output TFCI code word bits b~i~ are given by:

![](media/image162.wmf){width="1.8055555555555556in"
height="0.4722222222222222in"}

where *i* = 0,...,31. N~TFCI\ code\ word~ = 32.

#### 4.3.1.2 Coding of short TFCI lengths

##### 4.3.1.2.1 Coding very short TFCIs by repetition

If the number of TFCI bits is 1 or 2, then repetition will be used for
coding. In this case each bit is repeated to a total of 4 times giving
4-bit transmission (N~TFCI\ code\ word~ =4) for a single TFCI bit and
8-bit transmission (N~TFCI\ code\ word~ =8) for 2 TFCI bits. The TFCI
bit(s) a~0~ (or a~0~ and a~1~ where a~0~ is the LSB) shall correspond to
the TFC index (expressed in unsigned binary form) defined by the RRC
layer to reference the TFC of the CCTrCH in the associated radio frame.

In the case of N~TFCI\ code\ word~=4, the TFCI codeword {b~0~, b~1~,
b~2~, b~3~} is equal to the sequence {a~0~, a~0~, a~0~, a~0~}.

In the case of N~TFCI\ code\ word~=8, the TFCI codeword {b~0~, b~1~, ...
, b~7~} is equal to the sequence {a~0~, a~1~, a~0~, a~1~, a~0~, a~1~,
a~0~, a~1~}.

##### 4.3.1.2.2 Coding short TFCIs using bi-orthogonal codes

If the number of TFCI bits is in the range 3 to 5 the TFCI is encoded
using a (16, 5) bi-orthogonal (or first order Reed-Muller) code. The
coding procedure is as shown in figure 7.

height="0.7951388888888888in"}

Figure 7: Channel coding of short length TFCI bits

If the TFCI consists of less than 5 bits, it is padded with zeros to 5
bits, by setting the most significant bits to zero. The code words of
the (16,5) bi-orthogonal code are linear combinations of 5 basis
sequences as defined in table 9.

  ---- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

The TFCI bits a~0~ , a~1~ , a~2~ , a~3~ , a~4~ (where a~0~ is LSB and
a~4~ is MSB) shall correspond to the TFC index (expressed in unsigned
binary form) defined by the RRC layer to reference the TFC of the CCTrCH
in the associated radio frame.

The output code word bits b~j~ are given by:

![](media/image164.wmf){width="1.8055555555555556in"
height="0.4722222222222222in"}

where *i* = 0,...,15. N~TFCI\ code\ word~ = 16.

#### 4.3.1.3 Mapping of TFCI code word

The mapping of the TFCI code word to the TFCI bit positions in a
timeslot shall be as follows.

Denote the number of bits in the TFCI code word by N~TFCI\ code\ word~,
denote the TFCI code word bits by b~k~ where k=0... N~TFCI\ code\ word~
-1.

![](media/image165.wmf){width="3.5756944444444443in"

Figure 8: Mapping of TFCI code word bits to timeslot

The locations of the first and second parts of the TFCI code word in the
timeslot is defined in \[7\].

If the shortest transmission time interval of any constituent TrCH is at
least 20 ms the successive TFCI code words in the frames in the TTI
shall be identical. If TFCI is transmitted on multiple timeslots in a
frame each timeslot shall have the same TFCI code word.

### 4.3.2 Coding and Bit Scrambling of the Paging Indicator

The paging indicator P~q~, *q* = 0, \..., *N*~PI~-1, P*~q~* ∈ {0, 1} is
an identifier to instruct the UE whether there is a paging message for
the groups of mobiles that are associated to the PI, calculated by
higher layers, and the associated paging indicator P~q~. The length
L~PI~ of the paging indicator is L~PI~=2, L~PI~=4 or L~PI~=8 symbols.
*N*~PIB~ = 2\**N*~PI~\**L*~PI~ bits are used for the paging indicator
transmission in one radio frame. The mapping of the paging indicators to
the bits *e~i~*, *i* = 1, \..., *N*~PIB~ is shown in table 10.

Table 10: Mapping of the paging indicator

  ------ ---------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------
  P~q~   Bits {*e*~2Lpi\*q+1~, *e*~2Lpi\*q+2~, \... ,*e*~2Lpi\*(q+1)~ }   Meaning
  0      {0, 0, \..., 0}                                                  There is no necessity to receive the PCH
  1      {1, 1, \..., 1}                                                  There is the necessity to receive the PCH
  ------ ---------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------

If the number *S* of bits in one radio frame available for the PICH is
bigger than the number *N*~PIB~ of bits used for the transmission of
paging indicators, the sequence *e* = {*e*~1~, *e*~2~, \..., *e*~NPIB~}
is extended by *S*-*N*~PIB~ bits that are set to zero, resulting in a
sequence *h* = {*h*~1~, *h*~2~, \..., *h~S~*}:

The bits *h~k~* , *k* = 1, \..., *S* on the PICH then undergo bit
scrambling as defined in section 4.2.9.

The bits *s~k~*, *k* = 1, \..., S output from the bit scrambler are then
transmitted over the air as shown in \[7\].

### 4.3.3 Coding and Bit Scrambling of the MBMS Notification Indicator

The MBMS notification indicator N~q~, *q* = 0, \..., *N*~n~-1, N~q~ ∈
{0, 1}, is an identifier to instruct UEs whether there is an MBMS
notification indication for the groups of MBMS services that are
associated to the NI, calculated by higher layers, and the associated
MBMS notification indicator N~q~. The length L~NI~ of the MBMS
notification indicator is L~NI~=2, L~NI~=4 or L~NI~=8 symbols. *N*~NIB~
= 2\**N*~n~\**L*~NI~ bits are used for the MBMS notification indicator
transmission in one MICH. The mapping of the MBMS notification
indicators to the bits *e~i~*, *i* = 1, \..., *N*~NIB~ is shown in table
10A.

Table 10A: Mapping of the MBMS notification indicator

  ------ ----------------------------------------------------------------
  N~q~   Bits {*e*~2Lni\*q+1~, *e*~2Lni\*q+2~, \... ,*e*~2Lni\*(q+1)~ }
  0      {0, 0, \..., 0}
  1      {1, 1, \..., 1}
  ------ ----------------------------------------------------------------

If the number *S* of bits available for the MICH is bigger than the
number *N*~NIB~ of bits used for the transmission of MBMS notification
indicators, the sequence *e* = {*e*~1~, *e*~2~, \..., *e*~NNIB~} is
extended by *S*-*N*~NIB~ bits that are set to zero, resulting in a
sequence *h* = {*h*~1~, *h*~2~, \..., *h~S~*}:

The bits *h~k~* , *k* = 1, \..., *S* on the MICH then undergo bit
scrambling as defined in section 4.2.9.

The bits *s~k~*, *k* = 1, \..., S output from the bit scrambler are then
transmitted over the air as shown in \[7\].

4.4 Coding for layer 1 control for the 1.28 Mcps option
-------------------------------------------------------

### 4.4.1 Coding of transport format combination indicator (TFCI) for QPSK and 16QAM

The coding of TFCI for 1.28Mcps TDD is same as that of 3.84Mcps
TDD.cf.\[4.3.1 \'Coding of transport format combination indicator\'\].

#### 4.4.1.1 Mapping of TFCI code word

Denote the number of bits in the TFCI code word by N~TFCI\ code\ word~,
and denote the TFCI code word bits by b~k~, where k = 0, ...,
N~TFCI\ code\ word~ -1

When the number of bits in the TFCI code word is 8, 16, 32, the mapping
of the TFCI code word to the TFCI bit positions shall be as follows:

![](media/image166.wmf){width="5.093055555555556in"
height="1.854861111111111in"}

Figure 9: Mapping of TFCI code word bits to TFCI position in 1.28 Mcps
TDD option,\
where N = N~TFCI\ code\ word~.

For MBSFN transmissions with 16QAM, the coded bits *b~k~*, are mapped to
the transmitted TFCI bits according to the following two group formulas:

Formula a, mapping onto the outer-corners of the 16QAM constellation

*d~4k~* = *b*~2k~ *,*

*d~4k+1~* = *b~2k~*~+1~ ,

*d~4k+2~* = *1,*

*d~4k+3~* = *1,*

Formula b, mapping onto the inner-corners of the 16QAM constellation

*d~4k~* = *b*~2k~ *,*

*d~4k+1~* = *b~2k~*~+1~ ,

*d~4k+2~* =*0,*

*d~4k+3~* = *0,*

The 1^st^, the 3^rd^, the 5^th^ and the 7^th^ part of TFCI code word
will use the Mapping Formula a, and the 2^nd^, the 4^th^, the 6^th^ and
the 8^th^ part of TFCI code word will use the Mapping Formula b. As the
TTI of S-CCPCH is 40ms or 80ms, the TFCI bits will be repeated with a
period of 20ms frame. In the second 20ms frame, the 1^st^, the 3^rd^,
the 5^th^ and the 7^th^ part of TFCI code word will use the Mapping
Formula b, and the 2^nd^, the 4^th^, the 6^th^ and 8^th^ part of TFCI
code word will use the Mapping Formula a, and so on for the consecutive
frames. The mapping of the TFCI code word to the TFCI bit positions
shall be as follows:

Figure 9A: Mapping of TFCI code word bits to TFCI position in 1.28 Mcps
TDD option for downlink MBSFN, where N = N~TFCI\ code\ word~.

When the number of bits of the TFCI code word is 4 , then the TFCI code
word is equally divided into two parts for the consecutive two subframe
and mapped onto the end of the first data field in each of the
consecutive subframes.The mapping for N~TFCI\ code\ word~ =4 is shown in
figure 10:

![](media/image168.wmf){width="4.263194444444444in"
height="2.4756944444444446in"}

Figure 10: Mapping of TFCI code word bits to TFCI position in 1.28 Mcps
TDD option,\
when N~TFCI\ code\ word.~=4

The location of the 1st to 4th parts of the TFCI code word in the
timeslot is defined in \[7\].

If the shortest transmission time interval of any constituent TrCH is at
least 20 ms, then successive TFCI code words in the frames within the
TTI shall be identical. If a TFCI is transmitted on multiple timeslots
in a frame each timeslot shall have the same TFCI code word.

### 4.4.2 Coding of transport format combination indicator (TFCI) for 8PSK

Encoding of TFCI bits depends on the number of them and the modulation
in use. When 2 Mcps service is transmitted, 8PSK modulation is applied
in 1.28 Mcps TDD option. The encoding scheme for TFCI when the number of
bits are 6 -- 10, and less than 6 bits is described in section 4.4.2.1
and 4.4.2.2, respectively.

#### 4.4.2.1 Coding of long TFCI lengths

When the number of TFCI bits is 6 -- 10, the TFCI bits are encoded by
using a (64,10) sub-code of the second order Reed-Muller code, then 16
bits out of 64 bits are punctured (Puncturing positions are 0, 4, 8, 13,
16, 20, 27, 31, 34, 38, 41, 44, 50, 54, 57, 61^st^ bits). The coding
procedure is shown in Figure 11.

height="2.2736111111111112in"}

Figure 11: Channel coding of long TFCI bits for 8PSK

If the TFCI consists of less than 10 bits, it is padded with zeros to 10
bits, by setting the most significant bits to zero. The code words of
the punctured (48,10) sub-code of the second order Reed-Muller codes are
linear combination of 10 basis sequences. The basis sequences are shown
in Table 11.

  ---- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- --------

Let\'s define the TFCI bits as a~0~ , a~1~ , a~2~ , a~3~ , a~4~ , a~5~ ,
a~6~ , a~7~ , a~8~ , a~9~, where a~0~ is the LSB and a~9~ is the MSB.
The TFCI bits shall correspond to the TFC index (expressed in unsigned
binary form) defined by the RRC layer to reference the TFC of the CCTrCH
in the associated radio frame.

The output TFCI code word bits b~i~ are given by:

![](media/image170.wmf){width="1.8055555555555556in"
height="0.4722222222222222in"}

where i=0...47. N~TFCI\ code\ word~ =48.

#### 4.4.2.2 Coding of short TFCI lengths

##### 4.4.2.2.1 Coding very short TFCIs by repetition

When the number of TFCI bits is 1 or 2, then repetition will be used for
the coding. In this case, each bit is repeated to a total of 6 times
giving 6-bit transmission (N~TFCI\ code\ word~ = 6) for a single TFCI
bit and 12-bit transmission (N~TFCI\ code\ word~ = 12) for 2 TFCI bits.
The TFCI bit(s) a~0~ (or a~0~ and a~1~ where a~0~ is the LSB) shall
correspond to the TFC index (expressed in unsigned binary form) defined
by the RRC layer to reference the TFC of the CCTrCH in the associated
radio frame.

In the case of N~TFCI\ code\ word~=6, the TFCI codeword {b~0~, b~1~,
b~2~, b~3~, b~4~, b~5~} is equal to the sequence {a~0~, a~0~, a~0~,
a~0~, a~0~, a~0~}.

In the case of N~TFCI\ code\ word~=12, the TFCI codeword {b~0~, b~1~,
... , b~11~} is equal to the sequence {a~0~, a~1~, a~0~, a~1~, a~0~,
a~1~, a~0~, a~1~, a~0~, a~1~, a~0~, a~1~}.

##### 4.4.2.2.2 Coding short TFCIs using bi-orthogonal codes

If the number of TFCI bits is in the range of 3 to 5, the TFCI bits are
encoded using a (32,5) first order Reed-Muller code, then 8 bits out of
32 bits are punctured (Puncturing positions are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7^th^ bits). The coding procedure is shown in Figure 12.

height="2.4652777777777777in"}

Figure 12: Channel coding of short TFCI bits for 8PSK

If the TFCI consists of less than 5 bits, it is padded with zeros to 5
bits, by setting the most significant bits to zero. The code words of
the punctured (32,5) first order Reed-Muller codes are linear
combination of 5 basis sequences shown in Table 12.

Let\'s define the TFCI bits as a~0~ , a~1~ , a~2~ , a~3~ , a~4~, where
a~0~ is the LSB and a~4~ is the MSB. The TFCI bits shall correspond to
the TFC index (expressed in unsigned binary form) defined by the RRC
layer to reference the TFC of the CCTrCH in the associated radio frame.

The output code word bits b~i~ are given by:

![](media/image172.wmf){width="1.7638888888888888in"
height="0.4722222222222222in"}

where i=0...23. N~TFCI\ code\ word~ =24.

#### 4.4.2.3 Mapping of TFCI code word

Denote the number of bits in the TFCI code word by N~TFCI\ code\ word~,
and denote the TFCI code word bits by b~k~, where k = 0, ...,
N~TFCI\ code\ word~ -1.

When the number of bits in the TFCI code word is 12, 24 or 48, the
mapping of the TFCI code word to the TFCI bit positions in a time slot
shall be as follows.

![](media/image173.wmf){width="5.093055555555556in"
height="1.8645833333333333in"}

Figure 13: Mapping of TFCI code word bits to timeslot in 1.28 Mcps TDD
option,\
where N = N~TFCI\ code\ word~.

When the number of bits in the TFCI code word is 6, the TFCI code word
is equally divided into two parts for the consecutive two sub-frames and
mapped onto the first data field in each of the consecutive sub-frames.
The mapping of the TFCI code word to the TFCI bit positions in a time
slot shall be as shown in figure 14.

The location of the 1st to 4th parts of the TFCI code word in the
timeslot is defined in \[7\].

### 4.4.3 Coding and Bit Scrambling of the Paging Indicator

The paging indicator P~q~, *q* = 0, \..., *N*~PI~-1, P*~q~* ∈ {0, 1} is
an identifier to instruct the UE whether there is a paging message for
the groups of mobiles that are associated to the PI, calculated by
higher layers, and the associated paging indicator P~q~. The length
L~PI~ of the paging indicator is L~PI~=2, L~PI~=4 or L~PI~=8 symbols.
*N*~PIB~ = 2\**N*~PI~\**L*~PI~ bits are used for the paging indicator
transmission in one radio frame. The mapping of the paging indicators to
the bits *e~i~*, *i* = 1, \..., *N*~PIB~ is shown in table 13.

Table 13: Mapping of the paging indicator

  ------ ---------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------
  P~q~   Bits {*e*~2LPI\*q+1~, *e*~2LPI\*q+2~, \... ,*e*~2LPI\*(q+1)~ }   Meaning
  0      {0, 0, \..., 0}                                                  There is no necessity to receive the PCH
  1      {1, 1, \..., 1}                                                  There is the necessity to receive the PCH
  ------ ---------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------

If the number *S* of bits in one radio frame available for the PICH is
bigger than the number *N*~PIB~ of bits used for the transmission of
paging indicators, the sequence *e* = {*e*~1~, *e*~2~, \..., *e*~NPIB~}
is extended by *S*-*N*~PIB~ bits that are set to zero, resulting in a
sequence *h* = {*h*~1~, *h*~2~, \..., *h~S~*}:

The bits *h~k~* , *k* = 1, \..., *S* on the PICH then undergo bit
scrambling as defined in section 4.2.9.

The bits *s~k~*, *k* = 1, \..., S output from the bit scrambler are then
transmitted over the air as shown in \[7\].

### 4.4.4 Coding of the Fast Physical Access Channel (FPACH) information bits

The FPACH burst is composed by 32 information bits which are block coded
and convolutional coded, and then delivered in one sub-frame as follows:

1\. The 32 information bits are protected by 8 parity bits for error
detection as described in sub-clause 4.2.1.1.

2\. Convolutional code with constraint length 9 and coding rate ½ is
applied as described in sub-clause 4.2.3.1. The size of data block c(k)
after convolutional encoder is 96 bits.

3\. To adjust the size of the data block c(k) to the size of the FPACH
burst, 8 bits are punctured as described in sub-clause 4.2.7 with the
following clarifications:

\- N*~i;j~* =96 is the number of bits in a radio sub-frame before rate
matching

\- ∆N*~i,,j~* = -8 is the number of bits to punctured in a radio
sub-frame

\- e~ini~ = a x N*~ij~*

The 88 bits after rate matching are then delivered to the intra-frame
interleaving.

4\. The bits in input to the interleaving unit are denoted as {x(0),
..., x(87)}. The coded bits are block rectangular interleaved according
to the following rule: the input is written row by row, the output is
read column by column.

![](media/image176.wmf){width="2.2916666666666665in" height="1.0in"}

Hence, the interleaved sequence is denoted by y (i) and are given by:

y(0), y(1), ..., y(87)=x(0), x(8), ...,x(80),x(1), ..., x(87).

### 4.4.5 Coding and Bit Scrambling of the MBMS Notification Indicator

The MBMS notification indicator N~q~, *q* = 0, \..., *N*~n~-1, N*~q~* ∈
{0, 1} is an identifier to instruct the UE whether there is an MBMS
notification indication for the groups of MBMS services that are
associated to the NI, calculated by higher layers, and the associated
MBMS notification indicator N~q~. The length L~NI~ of the MBMS
notification indicator is L~NI~=2, L~NI~=4 or L~NI~=8 symbols. *N*~NIB~
= 2\**N*~n~\**L*~NI~ bits are used for the MBMS notification indicator
transmission in one MICH. The mapping of the MBMS notification
indicators to the bits *e~i~*, *i* = 1, \..., *N*~NIB~ is shown in table
13A.

Table 13A: Mapping of the MBMS notification indicator

  ------ ----------------------------------------------------------------
  N~q~   Bits {*e*~2LNI\*q+1~, *e*~2LNI\*q+2~, \... ,*e*~2LNI\*(q+1)~ }
  0      {0, 0, \..., 0}
  1      {1, 1, \..., 1}
  ------ ----------------------------------------------------------------

If the number *S* of bits available for the MICH is bigger than the
number *N*~NIB~ of bits used for the transmission of MBMS notification
indicators, the sequence *e* = {*e*~1~, *e*~2~, \..., *e*~NNIB~} is
extended by *S*-*N*~NIB~ bits that are set to zero, resulting in a
sequence *h* = {*h*~1~, *h*~2~, \..., *h~S~*}:

The bits *h~k~* , *k* = 1, \..., *S* on the MICH then undergo bit
scrambling as defined in section 4.2.9.

The bits *s~k~*, *k* = 1, \..., S output from the bit scrambler are then
transmitted over the air as shown in \[7\].

### 4.4.6 Coding of PLCCH

The PLCCH is a Node-B terminated channel used to carry dedicated
(UE-specific) TPC and SS information to multiple UEs. Each TPC/SS
command pair for a given UE is mapped to 3 bits as shown in table 13B.

Table 13B: Mapping of the TPC/SS pair

  ------------------------------------ ------------- ----------------
  3-bit TPC/SS command (MSB on left)   TPC command   SS command
  000                                  \'DOWN\'      \'DOWN\'
  100                                  \'UP\'        \'DOWN\'
  011                                  \'DOWN\'      \'UP\'
  111                                  \'UP\'        \'UP\'
  001                                  \'DOWN\'      \'Do Nothing\'
  101                                  \'UP\'        \'Do Nothing\'
  ------------------------------------ ------------- ----------------

Let *I=14* be the number of TPC/SS command pairs that can be carried by
a single PLCCH. The 3 bits corresponding to the *i^th^* TPC/SS command
pair ( *i=1...I* ), are denoted {$Β_{0}^{i}$, $Β_{1}^{i}$, $Β_{2}^{i}$}
where $Β_{0}^{i}$ is the MSB.

The bit sequence corresponding to the *I=14* TPC/SS command pairs is
denoted $\alpha_{k}$ (*k = 0,1,2,...41*). $Β_{n}^{i}$ (*n=0,1,2*) is
mapped to $\alpha_{k}$ such that:

The PLCCH burst is composed of 44 information bits {*b~plcch~(0),
b~plcch~(1),...,b~plcch~(43)*} which are repetition coded, and then
delivered in one sub-frame as follows:

1\. *b~plcch~(m)=* $\alpha_{m}$ (*for m=0,1,...41*) and *b~plcch~(m) =
0* (*for m=42,43*)

2\. Repetition coding with code rate ½ is applied to the sequence
{*b~plcch~(0),...,b~plcch~(43)*} in order to form the sequence {*x(0),
x(1), x(2), x(3),..., x(86), x(87)*}. The size of the data block after
the repetition encoder is 88 bits. The encoded codeword {*x(0), x(1),
x(2), x(3),...,x(86), x(87)*} is equal to {*b~plcch~ (0), b~plcch~ (0),
b~plcch~ (1), b~plcch~ (1),...,b~plcch~ (43), b~plcch~ (43)*}*.*

3\. The bits output from the repetition encoder {*x(0), ..., x(87)*} are
input to an interleaving unit. The coded bits are block rectangular
interleaved according to the following rule: the input is written row by
row, the output is read column by column.

![](media/image176.wmf){width="2.2916666666666665in" height="1.0in"}

Hence, the interleaved sequence is denoted by *y(i)* and is given by:

y(0), y(1), ..., y(87) = x(0), x(8), ..., x(80), x(1), ..., x(87).

The bit sequence y(0), y(1), ... y(87) is mapped to the PLCCH burst in
order of bit index, with the lowest bit index being the first bit (in
time) to be transmitted.

4.5 Coding for HS-DSCH
----------------------

Figure 15 illustrates the overall concept of transport-channel coding
for HS-DSCH. Data arrives at the coding unit in the form of one
transport block once every TTI. The TTI is 5 ms for 1.28 Mcps TDD and 10
ms for 3.84 Mcps TDD / 7.68Mcps TDD.

For 1.28 Mcps TDD, in the case of multiple-frequency transmission in one
TTI, a number of transport blocks arrive at the coding unit, in which
the number of transport blocks equals the number of frequencies used.
Each transport block for each frequency shall be coded separately as the
following coding step.

For 1.28Mcps TDD, in the case of MIMO dual stream transmission in one
TTI, two transport blocks arrive at the coding unit. Each transport
block for each data stream shall be coded separately as the following
coding step.

The following coding steps for HS-DSCH can be identified:

\- add CRC to each transport block (see subclause 4.5.1);

\- code block segmentation (see subclause 4.5.2);

\- channel coding (see subclause 4.5.3);

\- hybrid ARQ (see subclause 4.5.4);

\- bit scrambling (see subclause 4.5.5);

\- interleaving for HS-DSCH (see subclause 4.5.6);

\- constellation re-arrangement for 16QAM and 64QAM (see subclause
4.5.7);

\- mapping to physical channels (see subclause 4.5.8).

The coding steps for HS-DSCH are shown in figure 15.

Figure 15: Coding chain for HS-DSCH

In the following the number of transport blocks is always one. When
referencing non HS-DSCH formulae which are used in correspondence with
HS-DSCH formulae the convention is used that transport block subscripts
may be omitted (e.g. X~i~ when i is always 1 may be written X).

### 4.5.1 CRC attachment for HS-DSCH

A CRC of size 24 bits is calculated and added per HS-DSCH TTI. The CRC
polynomial is defined in 4.2.1.1 with the following specific parameters:
*i* = 1, *L~1~* = 24 bits.

### 4.5.2 Code block segmentation for HS-DSCH

Code block segmentation for the HS-DSCH transport channel shall be done
with the general method described in 4.2.2.2 above with the following
specific parameters.

There will only be one transport block, *i* = 1. The bits *b~im1~,
b~im2~, b~im3~,...b~imB~* input to the block are mapped to the bits
*x~i1~, x~i2~, x~i3~,...x~iX1~* directly. It follows that *X~1~* = *B*.
Note that the bits *x* referenced here refer only to the internals of
the code block segmentation function. The output bits from the code
block segmentation function are *o~ir1~, o~ir2~, o~ir3~,...o~irK~*.

The value of Z = 5114 for turbo coding shall be used.

### 4.5.3 Channel coding for HS-DSCH 

Channel coding for the HS-DSCH transport channel shall be done with the
general method described in 4.2.3 above with the following specific
parameters.

There will be a maximum of one transport block, *i* = 1. The rate 1/3
turbo coding shall be used.

### 4.5.4 Hybrid ARQ for HS-DSCH

The hybrid ARQ functionality matches the number of bits at the output of
the channel coder to the total number of bits of the HS-PDSCH set to
which the HS-DSCH is mapped. The hybrid ARQ functionality is controlled
by the redundancy version (RV) parameters. The exact set of bits at the
output of the hybrid ARQ functionality depends on the number of input
bits, the number of output bits, and the RV parameters.

The hybrid ARQ functionality consists of two rate-matching stages and a
virtual buffer as shown in the figure below.

The first rate matching stage matches the number of input bits to the
virtual IR buffer, information about which is provided by higher layers.
Note that, if the number of input bits does not exceed the virtual IR
buffering capability, the first rate-matching stage is transparent.

The second rate matching stage matches the number of bits after first
rate matching stage to the number of physical channel bits available in
the HS-PDSCH set in the TTI.

Figure 16: HS-DSCH hybrid ARQ functionality

#### 4.5.4.1 HARQ bit separation

The HARQ bit separation function shall be performed in the same way as
bit separation for turbo encoded TrCHs in 4.2.7.2 above.

#### 4.5.4.2 HARQ First Rate Matching Stage

HARQ first stage rate matching for the HS-DSCH transport channel shall
be done with the general method described in 4.2.7.1.2 above with the
following specific parameters.

The maximum number of soft channel bits available in the virtual IR
buffer is N~IR~ which is signalled from higher layers for each HARQ
process. The number of coded bits in a TTI before rate matching is
N^TTI^ this is deduced from information signalled from higher layers and
parameters signalled on the HS-SCCH for each TTI. Note that HARQ
processing and physical layer storage occurs independently for each HARQ
process currently active.

If N~IR~ is greater than or equal to N^TTI^ (i.e. all coded bits of the
corresponding TTI can be stored) the first rate matching stage shall be
transparent. This can, for example, be achieved by setting
*e~minus~* = 0. Note that no repetition is performed.

If N~IR~ is smaller than N^TTI^ the parity bit streams are punctured as
in 4.2.7.1.2 above by setting the rate matching parameter
$\text{ΔN}_{\text{il}}^{\text{TTI}} = N_{\text{IR}} - N^{\text{TTI}}$where
the subscripts i and l refer to transport channel and transport format
in the referenced sub-clause. Note the negative value is expected when
the rate matching implements puncturing. Bits selected for puncturing
which appear as δ in the algorithm in 4.2.7 above shall be discarded and
not counted in the totals for the streams through the virtual IR buffer.

#### 4.5.4.3 HARQ Second Rate Matching Stage

HARQ second stage rate matching for the HS-DSCH transport channel shall
be done with the general method described in 4.2.7.3 above with the
following specific parameters. Bits selected for puncturing which appear
as *δ* in the algorithm in 4.2.7.3 above shall be discarded and are not
counted in the streams towards the bit collection.

The parameters of the second rate matching stage depend on the value of
the RV parameters s and r. The parameter s can take the value 0 or 1 to
distinguish between transmissions that prioritise systematic bits (s =
1) and non systematic bits (s = 0). The parameter r (range 0 to
*r~max~-1*) changes the initial error variable *e~ini~* in the case of
puncturing. In case of repetition both parameters *r* and *s* change the
initial error variable *e~ini~*. The parameters X~i~, e~plus~ and
e~minus~ are calculated as per table 14below.

Denote the number of bits before second rate matching as *N~sys~* for
the systematic bits, *N~p1~* for the parity 1 bits, and *N~p2~* for the
parity 2 bits, respectively. For the HS-DSCH, denote the number of
timeslots used as *T*, the number of codes per timeslot as *C* and the
number of bits available in timeslot *t* as *U~t~*, where *U~t~* =
$\sum_{p = 1}^{C}U_{t,p}$ and $U_{t,p}$ is the number of bits available
in physical channel $p$ of timeslot *t* as defined in \[7\]. *N~data~*
is the number of bits available to the HS-DSCH in one TTI and is defined
as $N_{\text{data}} = \sum_{t = 1}^{T}U_{t}$. The rate matching
parameters are determined as follows.

For $N_{\text{data}} \leq N_{\text{sys}} + N_{p1} + N_{p2}$, puncturing
is performed in the second rate matching stage. The number of
transmitted systematic bits in a transmission is
$N_{t,\text{sys}} = \text{min}\left\{ N_{\text{sys}},N_{\text{data}} \right\}$
for a transmission that prioritises systematic bits and
$N_{t,\text{sys}} = \text{max}\left\{ N_{\text{data}} - \left( N_{p1} + N_{p2} \right),0 \right\}$
for a transmission that prioritises non systematic bits.

For $N_{\text{data}} > N_{\text{sys}} + N_{p1} + N_{p2}$ repetition is
performed in the second rate matching stage. A similar repetition rate
in all bit streams is achieved by setting the number of transmitted
systematic bits to
$N_{t,\text{sys}} = \left\lfloor N_{\text{sys}} \cdot \frac{N_{\text{data}}}{N_{\text{sys}} + 2N_{p1}} \right\rfloor$.

The number of parity bits in a transmission is:
$N_{t,p1} = \left\lfloor \frac{N_{\text{data}} - N_{t,\text{sys}}}{2} \right\rfloor$
and
$N_{t,p2} = \left\lceil \frac{N_{\text{data}} - N_{t,\text{sys}}}{2} \right\rceil$
for the parity 1 and parity 2 bits, respectively.

Table 14 below summarizes the resulting parameter choice for the second
rate matching stage.

Table 14: Parameters for HARQ second rate matching

  ------------- -------- ----------- ------------
                *X~i~*   *e~plus~*   *e~minus~*

  Systematic\                        
  RM S                               

  Parity 1\

  RM P2\_2                           
  ------------- -------- ----------- ------------

The rate matching parameter *e~ini~* is calculated for each bit stream
according to the RV parameters r and s using

$e_{\text{ini}}(r) = \left\{ \left( X_{i} - \left\lfloor \frac{r \cdot e_{\text{plus}}}{r_{\text{max}}} \right\rfloor - 1 \right)\ \text{mod}e_{\text{plus}} \right\} + 1$
in the case of puncturing,
i.e.,$N_{\text{data}} \leq N_{\text{sys}} + N_{p1} + N_{p2}$, and

$e_{\text{ini}}(r) = \left\{ \left( X_{i} - \left\lfloor (s + 2 \cdot r\frac{) \cdot e_{\text{plus}}}{(}2 \cdot r_{\text{max}}) \right\rfloor - 1 \right)\ \text{mod}e_{\text{plus}} \right\} + 1$
for repetition,
i.e.,$N_{\text{data}} > N_{\text{sys}} + N_{p1} + N_{p2}$.

Where and is the total number of redundancy versions allowed by varying
as defined in 4.6.1.4.

Note that r~max~ varies depending on the modulation mode, i.e. for 16QAM
and 64QAM *r~max~* = 2 and for QPSK *r~max~* = 4.

Note: For the modulo operation the following clarification is used: the
value of (x mod y) is strictly in the range of 0 to *y*-1 (i.e. -1 mod
10 = 9).

#### 4.5.4.4 HARQ bit collection

The HARQ bit collection is achieved using a rectangular interleaver of
size .

The number of rows and columns are determined from:

$N_{\text{row}} = 6$ for 64QAM

$N_{\text{row}} = 4$ for 16QAM

$N_{\text{row}} = 2$ for QPSK

$N_{\text{col}} = \frac{N_{\text{data}}}{N_{\text{row}}}$

where *N~data~* is used as defined in 4.5.4.3 above.

Data is written into the interleaver column by column, and read out of
the interleaver column by column, starting from the first column.

*N~t,sys~* is the number of transmitted systematic bits. Intermediate
values *N~r~* and *N~c~* are calculated using:

$N_{r} = \left\lfloor \frac{N_{t,\text{sys}}}{N_{\text{col}}} \right\rfloor$
and $N_{c} = N_{t,\text{sys}} - N_{r} \cdot N_{\text{col}}$.

If *N~c\ ~*= 0 and *N~r~* \> 0, the systematic bits are written into
rows 1...*N~r~*.

Otherwise systematic bits are written into rows 1...*N~r~+1* in the
first *N~c~* columns and, if *N~r\ ~*\> 0, also into rows 1...*N~r~* in
the remaining *N~col~-N~c~* columns.

The remaining space is filled with parity bits. The parity bits are
written column wise into the remaining rows of the respective columns.
Parity 1 and 2 bits are written in alternating order, starting with a
parity 2 bit in the first available column with the lowest index number.

In the case of 64QAM for each column the bits are read out of the
interleaver in the order row1, row2, row3, row4, row 5, row6. In the
case of 16QAM for each column the bits are read out of the interleaver
in the order row 1, row 2, row 3, row 4. In the case of QPSK for each
column the bits are read out of the interleaver in the order row1, row2.

### 4.5.5 Bit scrambling

The bit scrambling for HS-DSCH shall be done with the general method
described in subclause 4.2.9.

### 4.5.6 Interleaving for HS-DSCH

The interleaving for TDD is done over all bits in the TTI, as shown in
figure 17 when QPSK modulation is being used for the HS-DSCH, and figure
18 when 16-QAM modulation is being used, and figure 18a when 64QAM
modulation is being used. The bits input to the block interleaver are
denoted by *s~1~, s~2~, s~3~, \..., s~R~* , where *R* is the number of
bits in one TTI.

Figure 17: Interleaver structure for HS-DSCH with QPSK modulation

For QPSK, the interleaver is a block interleaver and consists of bits
input to a matrix with padding, the inter-column permutation for the
matrix and bits output from the matrix with pruning. The output bit
sequence from the block interleaver is derived as follows:

\(1\) The number of columns of the matrix is 30. The columns of the
matrix are numbered 0, 1, 2, ..., 29 from left to right.

\(2\) Determine the number of rows of the matrix, *R2*, by finding
minimum integer *R2* such that *R* ≤ 30 × *R2*. The rows of rectangular
matrix are numbered 0, 1, 2, ..., *R2* -- 1 from top to bottom.

> \(3\) Write the input bit sequence *s~1~, s~2~, s~3~, \..., s~R~* into
> the *R2* × 30 matrix row by row starting with bit *y~1~* in column 0
> of row 0:

$\begin{bmatrix}
y_{1} & y_{2} & y_{3} & \text{.}\text{.}\text{.} & y_{\text{30}} \\
y_{\text{31}} & y_{\text{32}} & y_{\text{33}} & \text{.}\text{.}\text{.} & y_{\text{60}} \\
 \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & & \vdots \\
y_{\text{30} \cdot (R2 - 1) + 1} & y_{\text{30} \cdot (R2 - 1) + 2} & y_{\text{30} \cdot (R2 - 1) + 3} & \text{.}\text{.}\text{.} & y_{\text{30} \cdot R2} \\
\end{bmatrix}$

> where *y~k~ = s~k~* for *k* = 1, 2, ..., *R* and, if *R* \< 30×*R2*,
> dummy bits are inserted for *k* = *R*+1, *R*+2, ..., 30×*R2*. These
> dummy bits are pruned away from the output of the matrix after the
> inter-column permutation.

\(4\) Perform the inter-column permutation for the matrix based on the
pattern
$\left\langle P2(j) \right\rangle_{j \in \left\{ 0,1,\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},\text{29} \right\}}$
that is shown in Table 7, where P2(*j*) is the original column position
of the *j*-th permuted column. After permutation of the columns, the
bits are denoted by *y\'~k~*.

$\begin{bmatrix}
y'_{1} & y'_{R2 + 1} & y'_{2 \cdot R2 + 1} & \text{.}\text{.}\text{.} & y'_{\text{29} \cdot R2 + 1} \\
y'_{2} & y'_{R2 + 2} & y'_{2 \cdot R2 + 2} & \text{.}\text{.}\text{.} & y'_{\text{29} \cdot R2 + 2} \\
 \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & & \vdots \\
y'_{R2} & y'_{2 \cdot R2} & y'_{3 \cdot R2} & \text{.}\text{.}\text{.} & y'_{\text{30} \cdot R2} \\
\end{bmatrix}$

\(5\) The output of the block interleaver is the bit sequence read out
column by column from the inter-column permuted *R2*×30 matrix. The
output is pruned by deleting dummy bits that were padded to the input of
the matrix before the inter-column permutation, i.e. bits *y\'~k~* that
corresponds to bits *y~k~* with *k \> R* are removed from the output.
The bits after interleaving are denoted by *v~1~, v~2~, v~3~, \...,
v~R~*, where *v~1~* corresponds to the bit *y\'~k~* with smallest index
*k* after pruning, *v~2~* to the bit *y\'~k~* with second smallest index
*k* after pruning, and so on.

Figure 18: Interleaver structure for HS-DSCH with 16-QAM modulation

For 16QAM, a second identical interleaver operates in parallel to the
first. For both interleavers, *R2* is chosen to be the minimum integer
that satisfies *R* ≤ 60 × *R2.* The output bits from the bit scrambling
operation are divided pairwise between the interleavers: bits *s~k~* and
*s~k+1~* go to the first interleaver and bits *s~k+2~* and *s~k+3~* go
to the second interleaver, where *k* mod 4 = 1. Bits are collected
pairwise from the interleavers: bits *v~k~* and *v~k+1~* are obtained
from the first interleaver and bits *v~k+2~* and *v~k+3~* are obtained
from the second interleaver, where again k mod 4 = 1.

Figure 18a: Interleaver structure for HS-DSCH with 64-QAM modulation

The interleaving for TDD is done over all bits in the TTI, as shown in
figure 18a when 64QAM modulation is being used for the HS-DSCH. The bits
input to the block interleaver are denoted by *s~1~, s~2~, s~3~, \...,
s~R~* , where *R* is the number of bits in one TTI.

For 64QAM, two identical interleavers operate in parallel to the first.
For all interleavers, *R2* is chosen to be the minimum integer that
satisfies *R* ≤ 90 × *R2.* The output bits from the bit scrambling
operation are divided into three parts of different interleavers: bits
*s~k~* and *s~k+1~* go to the first interleaver, bits *s~k+2~* and
*s~k+3~* go to the second interleaver and bits *s~k+4~* and *s~k+5~* go
to the third interleaver, where *k* mod 6 = 1. Bits are collected
accordingly from the interleavers: bits *v~k~* and *v~k+1~* are obtained
from the first interleaver, bits *v~k+2~* and *v~k+3~* are obtained from
the second interleaver and bits *v~k+4~* and *v~k+5~* are obtained from
the third interleaver, where again k mod 6 = 1.

### 4.5.7 Constellation re-arrangement for 16 QAM and 64 QAM

This function only applies to 16 QAM modulated bits. In case of QPSK it
is transparent.

The following table 15 describes the operations that produce the
different rearrangements.

The bits of the input sequence are mapped in groups of 4 so that *v~k~,
v~k+1~, v~k+2~, v~k+3~* are used, where k mod 4 = 1.

The output bit sequences from the table above map to the output bits in
groups of 4, i.e. *r~k~, r~k+1~, r~k+2~, r~k+3~*, where k mod 4 = 1.

The following table 15a describes the operations that produce the
different rearrangements of 64 QAM.

The bits of the input sequence are mapped in groups of 6 so that *v~k~,
v~k+1~, v~k+2~, v~k+3~, v~k+4~, v~k+5~* are used, where k mod 6 = 1.

The output bit sequences from the table above map to the output bits in
groups of 6, i.e. *r~k~, r~k+1~, r~k+2~, r~k+3~, r~k+4~, r~k+5~*, where
k mod 6 = 1.

### 4.5.8 Physical channel mapping for HS-DSCH

The HS-PDSCH is defined in \[7\]. The bits input to the physical channel
mapping are denoted by *r~1~*, *r~2~*, \..., *r~R~*, where *R* is the
number of physical channel bits in the allocation for the current TTI.
These bits are mapped to the physical channel bits, {*w~t,p,j~* : *t* =
1, 2, \..., *T*; *p* = 1, 2, \..., *C*; *j* = 1, 2, \..., *U~t,p~*},
where *t* is the timeslot index, *T* is the number of timeslots in the
allocation message, *p* is the physical channel index, *C* is the number
of codes per timeslot in the allocation message, *j* is the physical
channel bit index and *U~t,p~* is the number of bits for the physical
channel p in timeslot t. The timeslot index, *t*, increases with
increasing timeslot number; the physical channel index, *p*, increases
with increasing channelisation code index, and the physical channel bit
index, *j*, increases with increasing physical channel bit position in
time. If TS0 is included in the allocation message, TS0 has the maximum
timeslot index while the timeslot index of any other timeslot increases
with increasing timeslot number.

The bits *r~k~* shall be mapped to the PhCHs according to the following
rule :

Define {*y~t,k~* : *k* = 1, 2, \..., $\sum_{p = 1}^{C}U_{t,p}$} to be
the set of bits to be transmitted in timeslot *t* as follows :

$y_{1,k} = r_{k}$ for *k* = 1, 2, \..., $\sum_{p = 1}^{C}U_{1,p}$

$y_{2,k} = r_{k + \sum_{p = 1}^{C}U_{1,p}}$ for *k* = 1, 2, \...,
$\sum_{p = 1}^{C}U_{2,p}$

...

$y_{T,k} = r_{k + \sum_{t = 1}^{T - 1}{\sum_{p = 1}^{C}U_{t,p}}}$ for
*k* = 1, 2, \..., $\sum_{p = 1}^{C}U_{T,p}$

When the modulation level applied to the physical channels is 16- QAM :

The physical channel *p* used to transmit the *k*^th^ bit in the
sequence *y~t,k~* is :

if (k \<= *U~t,1~·C)*

$p = \left\lfloor \frac{k - 1}{4} \right\rfloor\text{mod}C + 1$

If *p* is odd then :

$w_{t,p,j} = y_{t,k}$
where$j = 4 \cdot \left\lfloor \frac{k - 1}{4 \cdot C} \right\rfloor + (k - 1)\text{mod}4 + 1$

If *p* is even then :

$w_{t,p,j} = y_{t,k}$

4.6 Coding/Multiplexing for HS-SCCH
-----------------------------------

For 1.28 Mcps TDD, HS-SCCH shall be of type 1 when the following two
conditions are both true:

\- the UE is not configured in MIMO mode, and

\- the variable HS\_DSCH\_SPS\_STATUS is FALSE.

> HS-SCCH type 1 may be used when the following two conditions are both
> true:

\- the UE is not configured in MIMO mode, and

\- the variable HS\_DSCH\_SPS\_STATUS is TRUE.

In this section, the terms \"HS-SCCH\" and \"HS-SCCH type 1\" are used
interchangeably.

The following information, provided by higher layers, is transmitted by
means of the HS-SCCH physical channel.

For 1.28 Mcps TDD, in the case of multi-frequency HS-DSCH transmission
in one TTI, HS-PDSCH on each frequency shall be configured with
associated HS-SCCH(s) which is coded and multiplexed as following.

\- Channelisation-code-set information (*q* bits where *q* = 8 for
1.28Mcps TDD / 3.84Mcps TDD and *q* = 10 for 7.68Mcps TDD)): *x~ccs,1~,
x~ccs,2~, ..., x~ccs,\ q~*

\- Time slot information (*n* bits where *n* = 5 for 1.28 Mcps TDD and
*n* = 13 for 3.84 Mcps TDD / 7.68Mcps TDD):\
*x~ts,1~, x~ts,2~, ..., x~ts,n~*

\- Modulation scheme information (1 bit): *x~ms,1~*

\- Transport-block size information (m bits where m = 6 for 1.28 Mcps
TDD and m = 9 for 3.84 Mcps TDD / 7.68Mcps TDD):\
*x~tbs,1~, x~tbs,2~, ..., x~tbs,m~*

\- Hybrid-ARQ process information (3 bits): *x~hap,1~, x~hap,2~,
x~hap,3~*

\- Redundancy version information (3 bits): *x~rv,1~, x~rv,2~,x~rv,3~*

\- New data indicator (1 bit): *x~nd,1~*

*- HS-SCCH cyclic sequence number (3 bits): x~hcsn,1~, x~hcsn,2~,
x~hcsn,3~*

\- UE identity (16 bits): *x~ue,1~, x~ue,2~, ..., x~ue,16~*

For an HS-SCCH order type A for 1.28Mcps TDD,

\- x~ccs,1~, x~ccs,2~, ..., x~ccs,\ q~ are reserved

*- x~ts,1~, x~ts,2~, ..., x~ts,n~* shall be set to \'00000\'

\- x~ms,1~, *x~tbs,1~, x~tbs,2~ shall be set to* x~odt,1~, x~odt,2~,
x~odt,3~

*- x~tbs,3~, x~tbs,4~, ..., x~tbs,m~*, x~hap,1~, x~hap,2~, x~hap,3~
,x~rv,1~, x~rv,2~,x~rv,3~ ,x~nd,1~, x~hcsn,1~, x~hcsn,2~, x~hcsn,3~ *are
reserved*

*where x~odt,1~, x~odt,2~, x~odt,3~ are defined in subclause 4.6A.*

The following coding/multiplexing steps can be identified:

\- multiplexing of HS-SCCH information (see subclause 4.6.2)

\- CRC attachment (see subclause 4.6.3);

\- channel coding (see subclause 4.6.4);

\- rate matching (see subclause 4.6.5);

\- interleaving for HS-SCCH (see subclause 4.6.6);

\- mapping to physical channels (see subclauses 4.6.7 and 4.6.8).

The general coding/multiplexing flow is shown in Figure 19.

If a value of *k~start~* = 16 and *k~stop~* = 1 is signalled, a
spreading factor of SF=1 shall be used for the HS-PDSCH resources. Other
than this case, *k~start~* \> *k~stop~* shall be treated as an error by
the UE.

If NON\_RECTANGULAR\_Resource\_ ALLOCATION\_STATUS is FALSE, HS-PDSCH
channelization codes of all the allocated timeslots are indicated by
channelisation-code-set information field.

If NON\_RECTANGULAR\_Resource\_ ALLOCATION\_STATUS is TRUE and
non-rectangular resource specific timeslot set is not configured via
higher layer signalling, the specific timeslot refers to the timeslot
with the maximal timeslot index among all the timeslots scheduled to the
UE and HS-PDSCH channelisation codes of the specific timeslot is
indicated by channelisation-code set information field. The HS-PDSCH
channelisation codes of timeslot 0 are signalled via higher layer
signalling if timeslot 0 is scheduled to the UE. The HS-PDSCH
channelisation codes of other scheduled timeslots are predefined, i.e.
the entire resource of each timeslot is scheduled to the UE with SF=1.

If NON\_RECTANGULAR\_RESOURCE\_ALLOCATION\_STATUS is TRUE and
non-rectangular resource specific timeslot set is configured via higher
layer signalling, HS-PDSCH channelisation codes in the specific timeslot
is indicated by channelisation-code set information field. The HS-PDSCH
channelisation codes of other scheduled timeslots are predefined, i.e.
the entire resource of the timeslot is scheduled to the UE with SF=1.

  ------------ ------------ ------------ ------------ ------------ ------------ ----------- ------------ ------------ ------------ ------------ -------------

If a value of *k~start~* = 32 and *k~stop~* = 1 is signalled, a
spreading factor of SF=1 shall be used for the HS-PDSCH resources. Other
than this case, *k~start~* \> *k~stop~* shall be treated as an error by
the UE.

#### 4.6.1.2 Timeslot information mapping

##### 4.6.1.2.1 1.28 Mcps TDD

For 1.28 Mcps, the timeslots to be used for HS-PDSCH resources are
signalled by the bits *x~ts,1~, x~ts,2~, ..., x~ts,5~*, where bit
*x~ts,n~* carries the information for timeslot n+1. Timeslot 1 cannot be
used for HS-DSCH resources. If the signalling bit is set (i.e. equal to
1), then the corresponding timeslot shall be used for HS-PDSCH
resources. Otherwise, the timeslot shall not be used. If
NON\_RECTANGULAR\_RESOURCE\_ALLOCATION\_STATUS is FALSE, all used
timeslots shall use the same channelisation code set, as signalled by
the channelisation code set information bits. Otherwise, the used
timeslots may use different channelization code sets as described in
4.6.1.1.1.

When indicated by the higher layer that Timeslot 0 can be used for
HS-PDSCH, bit *x~ts,1~* carries the information for timeslot 0. If
*x~ts,1~* is set (i.e. equal to 1), Timeslot 0 shall be used for
HS-PDSCH resource. Otherwise, Timeslot 0 shall not be used.

##### 4.6.1.2.2 3.84 Mcps TDD and 7.68Mcps TDD

For 3.84 Mcps, the timeslots to be used for HS-PDSCH resources are
signalled by the bits *x~ts,1~, x~ts,2~, ..., x~ts,13~*, where bit
*x~ts,n~* carries the information for the n^th^ available timeslot for
HS-PDSCH resources, where the order of the timeslots available for
HS-PDSCH resources shall be the same as the order of the 15 time slots
within each frame with the following two slots removed:

\- The slot containing the P-CCPCH

\- The first slot in a frame containing the PRACH

If the P-CCPCH and/or PRACH are assigned to some, but not all frames,
then the corresponding time slots shall remain unavailable for these
frames as well..

If the bit is set (i.e. equal to 1), then the corresponding timeslot
shall be used for HS-PDSCH resources. Otherwise, the timeslot shall not
be used. All used timeslots shall use the same channelisation code set,
as signalled by the channelisation code set information bits.

#### 4.6.1.3 Modulation scheme information mapping

The modulation scheme to be used by the HS-PDSCH resources shall be
signalled by bit *x~ms,1~*. If 64QAM is not supported by the UE, the
mapping scheme in Table 17 shall apply.

Table 17: Modulation scheme information mapping

  ------------- -------------------
  *x~ms~*~,1~   Modulation Scheme
  0             QPSK
  1             16-QAM
  ------------- -------------------

If 64QAM is supported by the UE, the mapping scheme in Table 17a shall
apply.

Table 17a: Modulation scheme information mapping

  ------------- -------------------
  *x~ms~*~,1~   Modulation Scheme
  0             QPSK or 64QAM
  1             16-QAM
  ------------- -------------------

The method of determining the modulation scheme by UE with 64QAM
capability is as following:

If *x~ms,1~* = 1, then modulation scheme is 16QAM;

Else if *x~ms,1~* = 0, then

Step 1, UE first calculates the physical resource bearer capability and
the transmission bit rate. The physical resource bearer capability is
the maximum bit rate at which RAN can transmit with the physical
resources assigned in HS-SCCH and the QPSK modulation. The physical
resource bearer capability can be calculated by the
channelization-code-set information and time slot information of
HS-SCCH.

The transmission bit rate is the bit rate to which the transport-block
size indicated in HS-SCCH corresponds.

Step 2, if the physical resource bearer capability multiplied by R is
less than the transmission bit rate, and R belongs to \[0, 1\],

> then modulation scheme is 64QAM;

else modulation scheme is QPSK.

Note: According to the simulation results the value of the transmission
bit rate divided by the physical resource bearer capability according to
64QAM should be more than 1/3, where the value of R is equal to 1.

If 64QAM is configured by UE, the method of determining recommended
modulation scheme by NodeB can be similar to 64QAM indication in
HS-SCCH. The details are:

If *x~ms,1~* =1, NodeB should determine the recommended modulation
scheme as 16QAM,

Else if *x~ms,1~* =0, NodeB calculates the physical resource bearer
capability assigned in HS-SCCH corresponding to RMF and RTBS in HS-SICH,
and calculates the transmission bit rate according to the RTBS in
HS-SICH, and then determines whether the recommended modulation scheme
is 64QAM or QPSK.

#### 4.6.1.4 Redundancy and constellation version information mapping

The redundancy version (RV) parameters *r*, *s* and constellation
version parameter *b* are mapped jointly to produce the value X~rv~.
X~rv~ is alternatively represented as the sequence x~rv,1~, x~rv,2~,
x~rv,3~ where x~rv,1~ is the MSB. This is done according to the
following tables according to the modulation mode used:

Table 18: RV mapping for 16 QAM and 64 QAM

  --------------- --- --- ---
  X~rv~ (value)   s   r   b
  0               1   0   0

#### 4.6.1.5 HS-SCCH cyclic sequence number

The HS-SCCH cyclic sequence number is mapped such that *x~hcsn,1~
corresponds to the MSB and x~hcsn,3~ to the LSB.*

#### 4.6.1.6 UE identity

*The UE identity is the HS-DSCH Radio Network Identifier (H-RNTI)
defined in \[12\].* This is mapped such that *x~ue,1~ corresponds to the
MSB and x~ue,16~ to the LSB*, cf. \[14\]*.*

#### 4.6.1.7 HARQ process identifier mapping

The hybrid-ARQ process information *x~hap,1~, x~hap,2~, x~hap,3~* is
unsigned binary representation of the HARQ process identifier where
*x~hap,1~* is MSB.

#### 4.6.1.8 Transport block size index mapping

The transport-block size information *x~tbs,1~, x~tbs,2~, ...,
x~tbs,m\ ~* is unsigned binary representation of the transport block
size index where *x~tbs,1~* is MSB.

### 4.6.2 Multiplexing of HS-SCCH information

The information carried on the HS-SCCH is multiplexed onto the bits
$a_{1},a_{2},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.}a_{A}$according to the following
rule :

### 4.6.3 CRC attachment for HS-SCCH

From the sequence of bits $a_{1},a_{2},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.}a_{A}$a
16 bit CRC is calculated according to Section 4.2.1.1. This gives a
sequence of bits $y_{1},y_{2},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.}y_{\text{16}}$
where

$y_{k} = p_{\text{im}\left( \text{17} - k \right)}$ k = 1,2,...16

This latter sequence of bits is then masked with the UE identity and
appended to the sequence of bits
$a_{1},a_{2},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.}a_{A}$. The bits at the output of
the CRC attachment block is the sequence of bits
$b_{1},b_{2},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.}b_{B}$, where

$b_{i} = a_{i}$ *i=1,2,...,A*

$b_{i} = \left( y_{i - A} + x_{\text{ue},i - A} \right)\text{mod}2$
*i=A+1...B*

### 4.6.4 Channel coding for HS-SCCH

Channel coding for the HS-SCCH shall be done with the general method
described in 4.2.3 with the following specific parameters:

The rate 1/3 convolutional coding shall be used for HS-SCCH.

### 4.6.5 Rate matching for HS-SCCH

Rate matching for HS-SCCH shall be done with the general method
described in 4.2.7.

### 4.6.6 Interleaving for HS-SCCH

Interleaving for HS-SCCH shall be done with the general method described
in 4.2.11.1.

### 4.6.7 Physical Channel Segmentation for HS-SCCH

Physical channel segmentation for HS-SCCH shall be done with the general
method described in 4.2.10. For 1.28 Mcps TDD, the HS-SCCH consists of
two physical channels HS-SCCH1 and HS-SCCH2; for 3.84 Mcps TDD and
7.68Mcps TDD the HS-SCCH only uses one physical channel, see \[7\].

### 4.6.8 Physical channel mapping for HS-SCCH

Physical channel mapping for the HS-SCCH shall be done with the general
method described in subclause 4.2.12.

4.6A Coding/Multiplexing for HS-SCCH orders type A
--------------------------------------------------

HS-SCCH orders type A are commands sent to the UE using HS-SCCH. No
HS-PDSCH is associated with HS-SCCH orders.

For 1.28 Mcps TDD, HS-SCCH order type A may be used when any of the
following conditions is true:

\- HS\_DSCH\_RECEPTION\_CELL\_FACH\_STATE is TRUE;

\- CONTROL\_CHANNEL\_DRX\_STATUS is TRUE, and UE is not configured in
MIMO mode;

\- CONTROL\_CHANNEL\_DRX\_STATUS is TRUE, and UE is configured in MIMO
mode while the variable MIMO SF mode for HS-PDSCH dual stream is SF1

\- the variable HS\_DSCH\_SPS\_STATUS is TRUE, and UE is not configured
in MIMO mode;

\- the variable HS\_DSCH\_SPS\_STATUS is TRUE, and UE is configured in
MIMO mode while the variable MIMO SF mode for HS-PDSCH dual stream is
SF1.

The following information is transmitted by means of the HS-SCCH order
type A physical channel.

\- Order type (3 bits): *x~odt,1~, x~odt,2~, x~odt,3~*

\- UE identity (16 bits): *x~ue,1~, x~ue,2~, ..., x~ue,16~*

The coding for HS-SCCH orders type A is specified in subclause 4.6.

### 4.6A.1 HS-SCCH orders type A information field mapping

#### 4.6A.1.1 Order type mapping

If *x~odt,1~, x~odt,2~, x~odt,3~*= *\'000\'*, then the HS-SCCH order is
an uplink synchronization establishment order when UE is in CELL\_FACH
or CELL\_PCH state.

If *x~odt,1~, x~odt,2~, x~odt,3~*= \'*001*\', then the HS-SCCH order is
an order to release the allocated semi-persistent HS-PDSCH resources
when UE is in CELL\_DCH state.

If *x~odt,1~, x~odt,2~, x~odt,3~*= \'*010*\', then the HS-SCCH order is
DRX Activation order when UE is in CELL\_DCH state.

If *x~odt,1~, x~odt,2~, x~odt,3~*= \'*011*\', then the HS-SCCH order is
DRX De-activation order when UE is in CELL\_DCH state.

#### 4.6A.1.2 UE identity mapping

*The UE identity is the HS-DSCH Radio Network Identifier (H-RNTI)
defined in \[12\].* This is mapped such that *x~ue,1~ corresponds to the
MSB and x~ue,16~ to the LSB*, cf. \[14\]*.*

4.6B Coding/Multiplexing for HS-SCCH type 2 (1.28 Mcps TDD only)
----------------------------------------------------------------

\- the variable HS\_DSCH\_SPS\_STATUS is TRUE, and UE is not configured
in MIMO mode;

\- the variable HS\_DSCH\_SPS\_STATUS is TRUE, and UE is configured in
MIMO mode while the variable MIMO SF mode for HS-PDSCH dual stream is
SF1.

HS-SCCH type 2 is used to allocate semi-persistent HS-PDSCH resources
for the initial transmissions. The following information is transmitted
by means of the HS-SCCH type 2 physical channels.

\- Type flag 1 (2 bits): *x~flag1,1~*, *x~flag1,2~*

\- Resource repetition pattern index (2bits): *x~rrpi,1~*, *x~rrpi,2~*

\- Type flag 2 (2 bits): *x~flag2,1~*, *x~flag2,2~*

For an HS-SCCH order type A,

\- x~flag1,1~, x~flag1,2~, x~rrpi,1~, x~rrpi,2~ , x~flag2,1~,
x~flag2,2~, *x~tbs,1~, x~tbs,2~* are reserved

*- x~ts,1~, x~ts,2~, ..., x~ts,5~* shall be set to \'00000\'

\- x~ccs,1~, *x~ccs,2~, x~ccs,3~ shall be set to* x~odt,1~, x~odt,2~,
x~odt,3~

\- x~ccs,4~, *x~ccs,5~, x~ccs,6~*, x~ms,1~, x~HI,1~, x~HI,2~, x~hcsn,1~,
x~hcsn,2~, x~hcsn,3~, x~res,1~, x~res,2~, x~res,3~ , x~res,4,~ x~res,5~
*are reserved*

*where x~odt,1~, x~odt,2~, x~odt,3~ are defined in subclause 4.6A.*

The following coding/multiplexing steps for HS-SCCH type 2 can be
identified:

\- multiplexing of HS-SCCH type 2 information (see subclause 4.6B.2)

\- interleaving for HS-SCCH type 2 (see subclause 4.6B.6);

\- mapping to physical channels for HS-SCCH type 2 (see subclauses
4.6B.7 and 4.6B.8).

The general coding/multiplexing flow for HS-SCCH type 2 is shown in
Figure 19A.

### 4.6B.1 HS-SCCH type 2 information field mapping

#### 4.6B.1.1 Type flag 1 mapping

The type flag 1 *x~flag1,1~, x~flag1,2~* are mapped such that
*x~flag1,1~* =*\'1\'*corresponds to the MSB and *x~flag1,2~* =*\'1\'* to
the LSB. The type flag 1 is used to distinguish HS-SCCH type 2 from
other types.

#### 4.6B.1.2 Resource repetition pattern index mapping

The resource repetition pattern index *x~rrpi,1~*, *x~rrpi,2~* is the
unsigned binary representation of a reference to one of repetition
patterns of the assigned semi-persistent HS-PDSCH resources configured
by higher layers. The resource repetition pattern index *x~rrpi,1~*,
*x~rrpi,2~* are mapped such that *x~rrpi,1~*corresponds to the MSB and
*x~rrpi,2~* to the LSB. The mapping of *x~rrpi,1~ x~rrpi,2~ =\'00\'* is
not used.

#### 4.6B.1.3 Type flag 2 mapping

The type flag 2 *x~flag2,1~, x~flag2,2~* are mapped such that
*x~flag2,1~* =*\'1\'*corresponds to the MSB and *x~flag2,2~* =*\'0\'* to
the LSB. The type flag 2 is used to distinguish HS-SCCH type 2 from
other types.

#### 4.6B.1.4 Transport block size index mapping

The transport-block size information *x~tbs,1~, x~tbs,2~* is the
unsigned binary representation of a reference to one of the four
Transport-block sizes configured by higher layers.

#### 4.6B.1.5 Timeslot information mapping

The mapping of the time slot information *x~ts,1~, x~ts,2~, ... x~ts,5~*
is performed according to section 4.6.1.2.1.

#### 4.6B.1.6 Channelisation code set information mapping

HS-PDSCH channelisation codes are allocated contiguously from a
signalled start code to a signalled stop code, and the allocation
includes both the start and stop code. The start code *k~start~* is
signalled by the bits *x~ccs,1~, x~ccs,2,~ x~ccs,3~* and the stop code
*k~stop~* by the bits *x~ccs,4,~ x~ccs,5~, x~ccs,6~*. The mapping in
Table 16B below applies.

If a value of *k~start~* = 9 and *k~stop~* = 6 is signalled, a spreading
factor of SF=1 shall be used for the HS-PDSCH resources. Other than this
case, *k~start~* \> *k~stop~* are not used.

### 4.6H.1 HS-SCCH type 8 information field mapping

#### 4.6H.1.1 Channelisation code set information mapping

HS-PDSCH channelisation codes are allocated contiguously from a
signalled start code to a signalled stop code, and the allocation
includes both the start and stop code.

If the field flag *x~flag2,1~*=*\'0\'*, the special information
*x~info,1~, x~info,2~* are comprised of the channelisation code set
extended information *x~ccs,5~, x~ccs,6~* and *x~info,1~*= *x~ccs,5~*,
*x~info,2~*= *x~ccs,6~*. The start code *k~start~* is signalled by the
bits *x~ccs,1~, x~ccs,2,~ x~ccs,5~* and the stop code *k~stop~* by the
bits *x~ccs,3,~ x~ccs,4~, x~ccs,6~*. The mapping in Table 16Ba below
applies.

If a value of *k~start~* = 5 and *k~stop~* = 2 is signalled, a spreading
factor of SF=1 shall be used for the HS-PDSCH resources. Other than this
case, *k~start~* \> *k~stop~* are not used.

If the field flag *x~flag2,1~*=*\'1\'*, the bits *x~info,1~, x~info,2~*
are comprised of the special default midamble pattern indicator
(*x~mpi,1~, x~mpi,2~*) and *x~info,1~= x~mpi,1~ and x~info,2~=
x~mpi,2~*. The mapping in Table 16Bb below applies. The start code
*k~start~* is signalled by the bits *x~ccs,1~, x~ccs,2~* and the stop
code *k~stop~* by the bits *x~ccs,3,~ x~ccs,4~*. The mapping in Table
16Bc below applies.

If a value of *k~start~* =13 and *k~stop~* = 4 is signalled, a spreading
factor of SF=1 shall be used for the HS-PDSCH resources. Other than this
case, *k~start~* \> *k~stop~* are not used

4.8 Coding for E‑DCH
--------------------

Figure 22 shows the processing structure for the E‑DCH transport channel
mapped onto a separate CCTrCH. Data arrives to the coding unit in form
of a maximum of one transport block once every transmission time
interval (TTI). A 10ms TTI is used for E-DCH for 3.84Mcps and 7.68Mcps
TDD whilst for 1.28Mcps TDD, a TTI of 5ms will be used.

For 1.28Mcps TDD multi-carrier E-DCH transmission, a number of transport
blocks may arrive at the coding unit in one TTI, where the number of the
transport blocks equals to the number of the scheduled E-DCH carriers.
Each transport block for each scheduled E-DCH carrier shall be coded
separately. The following coding steps for E-DCH on one carrier can be
identified:

\- add CRC to each transport block (see subclause 4.8.1);

\- code block segmentation (see subclause 4.8.2);

\- channel coding (see subclause 4.8.3);

\- hybrid ARQ (see subclause 4.8.4);

\- bit scrambling (see subclause 4.8.5);

\- interleaving for E-DCH (see subclause 4.8.6);

\- constellation re-arrangement for 16QAM (see subclause 4.8.7);

\- mapping to physical channels (see subclause 4.8.8).

Figure 22. Coding chain for E-DCH

In the following the number of transport blocks is always one. When
referencing non E-DCH formulae which are used in correspondence with
E-DCH formulae the convention is used that transport block subscripts
may be omitted (e.g. X~i~ when i is always 1 may be written X).

### 4.8.1 CRC attachment for E-DCH

CRC attachment for the E-DCH transport channel shall be performed
according to the general method described in 4.2.1 above with the

input to the block are mapped to the bits
$x_{i1},x_{i2},x_{i3},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},x_{\text{iX}_{i}}$
directly. It follows that *X~i~* = *B~i~*. Note that the bits *x*
referenced here refer only to the internals of the code block
segmentation function. The output bits from the code block segmentation
function are *o~ir1~*, *o~ir2~*, *o~ir3~*, ..., *o~irK~*.

coding shall be used.

### 4.8.4 Physical layer HARQ functionality and rate matching for E-DCH

The hybrid ARQ functionality matches the number of bits at the output of
the channel coder to the total number of bits of the E-PUCH set to which
the E-DCH transport channel is mapped. The hybrid ARQ functionality is
controlled by the redundancy version (RV) parameters.

Figure 23: E‑DCH hybrid ARQ functionality

#### 4.8.4.1 Determination of SF, modulation and number of physical channels

The SF, modulation type and number of E-PUCHs in the E-PUCH set is
determined by higher layers (see \[15\]). These correspond to a value of
*N~e,data,j~*.

#### 4.8.4.2 HARQ bit separation

bit separation for turbo encoded TrCHs with puncturing in 4.2.7.2.1
above.

The hybrid ARQ rate matching for the E-DCH transport channel shall be
done with the general method described in 4.2.7.3 with the following
specific parameters.

parameters *s* and *r*. The *s* and *r* combinations corresponding to
each RV allowed for the E-DCH are listed in table 22 below.

accordance with the general method described for HS-DSCH in subclause
4.5.7. For QPSK this function is transparent.

For 3.84Mcps and 7.68Mcps, the constellation version parameter *b* is
associated with the E-DCH RV index as shown in table 23 below.

  2                2
  3                3
  ---------------- -----

For 1.28Mcps option, the constellation version parameter *b* is
associated with the retransmission sequence number (RSN). The mapping
between RSN and b parameters for constellation re-arrangement is listed
in table 25A in subclause 4.9.2.1.2.

### 4.8.8 Physical channel mapping for E-DCH

The E-PUCH is defined in \[7\]. The bits input to the physical channel
mapping are denoted by *r~1~*, *r~2~*, \..., *r~R~*, where *R=
N~e,data,j~* and is the number of physical channel data bits to be
transmitted in the current TTI. These bits are mapped to the physical
channel bits, {*w~t,k~* : *t* = 1, 2, \..., *T*; and *k* = 1, 2, \...,
*U~t~*}, where *t* is the timeslot index, *T* is the number of timeslots
in the allocation message*, k* is the physical channel bit index and
*U~t~* is the number of bits in the E-PUCH physical channel in timeslot
*t*. The timeslot index, *t*, increases with increasing timeslot number
and the physical channel bit index, *k*, increases with increasing
physical channel bit position in time.

The bits *r~1~*, *r~2~*, \..., *r~R~* shall be mapped to the physical
channel bits *w~t,k~* according to the following rule :

$w_{1,k} = r_{k}$ for *k* = 1, 2, \..., *U~1~*

$w_{2,k} = r_{k + U_{1}}$ for *k* = 1, 2, \..., *U~2~*

...

$w_{T,k} = r_{k + \sum_{t = 1}^{T - 1}U_{t}}$ for *k* = 1, 2, \...,
*U~T~*

4.9 Coding for E‑UCCH
---------------------

### 4.9.1 Coding for E-UCCH for the 3.84Mcps and 7.68Mcps TDD options

E-UCCH is coded in two parts, E-UCCH part 1 and E-UCCH part 2. Both
parts of the E-UCCH are transmitted on the E-PUCH (see \[7\]).

The following information is transmitted by means of E-UCCH part 1:

\- E-TFCI information: *x~tfci,1~*, *x~tfci,2~*, \..., *x~tfci,7~*

The following information is transmitted by means of E-UCCH part 2:

\- Retransmission sequence number (RSN): *x~rsn,1~*, *x~rsn,2~*

\- HARQ process ID (HARQ\_ID): *x~harq,1~*, *x~harq,2~*

#### 4.9.1.1 Overview

Figure 24 below illustrates the overall coding chain for E-UCCH.

Figure 24: Coding chain for E‑UCCH parts 1 and 2

#### 4.9.1.2 E‑UCCH part 1

##### 4.9.1.2.1 Information field mapping of E‑TFCI

The E‑TFCI is mapped such that *x~tfci,1~ corresponds to the MSB.*

##### 4.9.1.2.2 Channel coding for E-UCCH part 1

The E-TFCI bits
$x_{\text{tfci},1},x_{\text{tfci},2},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},x_{\text{tfci},7}$are
zero-padded and coded to produce the bits *y~0~, y~1~,...y~31~* using a
(32,10) sub-code of the second order Reed-Muller code as defined in
subclause 4.3.1.1. Bits
$x_{\text{tfci},1},x_{\text{tfci},2},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},x_{\text{tfci},7}$
correspond to bits $a_{6},a_{5},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},a_{0}$ of
subclause 4.3.1.1, and bits $a_{9},a_{8},a_{7}$ of subclause 4.3.1.1 are
set to zero.

##### 4.9.1.2.3 Physical channel mapping for E‑UCCH part 1

E-UCCH part 1 is described in \[7\]. The sequence of bits *y~0~*,
*y~1~*, \..., *y~31~* output from the E-UCCH part 1 channel coding is
mapped to the E-UCCH part 1 indicator field of each E-PUCH of the E-DCH
TTI configured to carry E-UCCH. The bits *y~i~* {*i=0,1,...31*} are
mapped in an identical manner to that described for TFCI in subclause
4.3.1.3 such that they are transmitted over the air in ascending order
with respect to *i*.

#### 4.9.1.3 E‑UCCH part 2

##### 4.9.1.3.1 Information field mapping of retransmission sequence number

To indicate the redundancy version (RV) of each HARQ transmission and to
assist the Node B soft buffer management a two bit retransmission
sequence number (RSN) is signalled from the UE to the Node B. The Node B
can avoid soft buffer corruption by flushing the soft buffer associated
to one HARQ process in case the last received RSN for that HARQ process
is incompatible with the current one.

The RSN is set by higher layers as described in \[15\]. For a given HARQ
process, once the maximum RSN value of 3 is reached, the RSN alternates
between the values of 2 and 3 for any further retransmissions. The RSN
thus follows the pattern 0,1,2,3,2,3,2,3,2,3,... The RSN is transmitted
by the physical layer in E-UCCH part 2.

The bits (*x~rsn,1~, x~rsn,2~*) of the RSN field of E-UCCH part 2 are
mapped such that *x~rsn,1~ corresponds to the MSB of the RSN and
x~rsn,2~ corresponds to the LSB of the RSN.*

The applied E-DCH RV index specifying the used RV (*s* and *r*
parameter) and in the case of 16-QAM, also the used constellation
rearrangement parameter (*b*) both depend only on the values of RSN, and
on *N~sys~* / *N~e,data,j~* as shown in table 25 below.

The UE shall use either:

\- an RV index as indicated in Table 25 and according to the value of
RSN

\- or, if signalled by higher layers only E-DCH RV index 0 independently
of the value of RSN.

##### 4.9.1.3.2 Information field mapping of HARQ process ID

*The HARQ process ID bits (x~harq,1~*, *x~harq,2~*) transmitted on
E-UCCH part 2 correspond to the two LSBs of the 3-bit HARQ ID indicated
by higher layers (the MSB of the higher layer HARQ ID is not
transmitted). Thus, with the higher layer HARQ ID represented as *h~1~,
h~2~, h~3~* (with *h~1~* as the MSB), *bits x~harq,1~*, *x~harq,2~*
correspond to bits *h~2~, h~3~*.

##### 4.9.1.3.3 Multiplexing of E‑UCCH part 2 information

The retransmission sequence number information (*x~rsn,1~, x~rsn,2~*)
and the HARQ process ID information (*x~harq,1~, x~harq,2~*) are
multiplexed together to give a sequence of bits *x~1~, x~2~, ..., x~4~*
where:

*x~k~ = x~rsn,k~ k=1,2*

*x~k~ = x~harq,k-2~ k=3,4*

##### 4.9.1.3.4 Channel coding for E-UCCH part 2

The bits $x_{1},x_{2},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},x_{4}$are zero-padded and
coded to produce the bits z*~0~, z~1~,...z~31~* using a (32,10) sub-code
of the second order Reed-Muller code as defined in subclause 4.3.1.1.
Bits $x_{1},x_{2},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},x_{4}$ correspond to bits
$a_{3},a_{2},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},a_{0}$ of subclause 4.3.1.1, and
bits $a_{9},a_{8},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.},a_{4}$ of subclause 4.3.1.1
are set to zero.

##### 4.9.1.3.5 Physical channel mapping for E‑UCCH part 2

E-UCCH part 2 is described in \[7\]. The sequence of bits *z~0~*,
*z~1~*, \..., *z~31~* output from the E-UCCH part 2 channel coding is
mapped to the E-UCCH part 2 indicator field of each E-PUCH of the E-DCH
TTI configured to carry E-UCCH. The bits *z~i~* {*i=0,1,...31*} are
mapped such that they are transmitted over the air in ascending order
with respect to *i*.

### 4.9.2 Coding for E-UCCH for the 1.28Mcps TDD option

The E-UCCH on one carrier is used to convey the following information
for the E-DCH on the same carrier:

\- The modulation type of the selected E-TFC -- 0 bits (see note 1)

\- The transport block size of the selected E-TFC -- 6 bits

\- The retransmission sequence number (RSN) -- 2 bits

\- The HARQ process ID -- 2 bits

Note 1: The occupied modulation type is not explicitly signaled, which
is inferred from the transport block size.

The E-UCCHs on the different carriers are coded independently. The
E-UCCH on one carrier is transmitted on the E-PUCH on the same carrier
and is coded using a (32, 10) sub code of the second order Reed Muller
code as defined in subclause 4.3.1.1

Figure 24A below illustrates the overall coding chain for E-UCCH on one
carrier.

#### 4.9.2.1 E-UCCH information field mapping

##### 4.9.2.1.1 Information field mapping of E-TFCI

The E-TFCI is mapped such that *x~tfci,1~ corresponds to the MSB.*

##### 4.9.2.1.2 RSN information mapping

To indicate the redundancy version (RV) of each HARQ transmission and to
assist the Node B soft buffer management a two bit retransmission
sequence number (RSN) is signalled from the UE to the Node B. The Node B
can avoid soft buffer corruption by flushing the soft buffer associated
to one HARQ process in case the last received RSN for that HARQ process
is incompatible with the current one.

The RSN is set by higher layers as described in \[15\]. For a given HARQ
process, once the maximum RSN value of 3 is reached, the RSN alternates
between the values of 2 and 3 for any further retransmissions. The RSN
thus follows the pattern 0,1,2,3,2,3,2,3,2,3,....

The bits (*x~rsn,1~, x~rsn,2~*) of the RSN field are mapped such that
*x~rsn,1~ corresponds to the MSB of the RSN and x~rsn,2~ corresponds to
the LSB of the RSN.*

The used RV is implicitly linked to the transmitted RSN, as such the
Node-B is always able to determine the correct RV if the RSN information
is correctly obtained.

The constellation rearrangement parameter linkage with RSN is shown in
Table 25A below

In addition to being associated with the value of RSN, the redundancy
version (RV) of the E-DCH transmission is also associated with the
coding rate of the E-DCH transmission according to Table 25B and Table
25C below.

The UE shall use either:

\- an RV index as indicated in Table 25A, 25B, 25C and according to the
value of RSN

\- or, if signalled by higher layers only E-DCH RV index 0 independently
of the value of RSN.

##### 4.9.2.1.3 HARQ information mapping

The bits (*x~harq,1~, x~harq,2~*) of the HARQ field are mapped such that
*x~harq,1~ corresponds to the MSB of the HARQ process ID and x~harq,2~
corresponds to the LSB of the HARQ process ID.*

#### 4.9.2.2 Multiplexing for E-UCCH

The transport block size information (*x~tbs,1~,..., x~tbs,6~*),
retransmission sequence number information (*x~rsn,1~, x~rsn,2~*) and
the HARQ process ID information (*x~harq,1~, x~harq,2~*) are multiplexed
together to give a sequence of bits *x~1~, x~2~, ..., x~10~* where:

*x~k~ = x~tbs,k~ k=1,2,3,4,5,6*

*x~k~ = x~rsn,k-6~ k=7,8*

*x~k~ = x~harq,k-8~ k=9,10*

#### 4.9.2.3 Coding for E-UCCH

The bits are coded to produce the bits z*~0~, z~1~,...z~31~* using a
(32,10) sub-code of the second order Reed-Muller code as defined in
subclause 4.3.1.1.

#### 4.9.2.4 Physical channel mapping for E-UCCH

The E-UCCH is described in \[7\]. The sequence of bits *z~0~*, *z~1~*,
\..., *z~31~* output from the E-UCCH channel coding is mapped with E-DCH
to E-PUCH of the E-DCH TTI configured to carry E-UCCH.

4.10 Coding for E-AGCH
----------------------

The E-AGCHs on the different carriers are coded independently.

For the 1.28 Mcps TDD, E-AGCH type 1 is used when the variable
E\_DCH\_SPS\_STATUS=FALSE and the UE is not configured in MU-MIMO mode
by higher layers for a UE (as defined in \[12\]).

In this section, the terms \"E-AGCH\" and \"E-AGCH type 1\" are used
interchangeably.

The E-AGCH carries the following fields multiplexed into *w* bits
*x~ag,1~, x~ag,2~, ... x~ag,w~*. *w* is within the range 14 to 28 bits
(for the 3.84Mcps option) and 15 to 29 bits (for the 7.68Mcps option)
and 23 to 26 bits (for the 1.28Mcps option)

\- Absolute grant (power) value (*x~pg,1~, x~pg,2~, ... x~pg,5~*) {5
bits},

\- Code resource related information (*x~c,1~, x~c,2~, ... x~c,Nc~*),
{N~c~=5 bits for the 1.28Mcps and 3.84Mcps options, N~c~=6 bits for the
7.68Mcps option}

\- Timeslot resource related information (*x~t,1~, x~t,2~, ...
x~t,nTRRI~*), {n~TRRI~ bits} \[n~TRRI~ =5 for 1.28Mcps, and is
configured by higher layers for 3.84Mcps and 7.68Mcps options\]

\- E-AGCH Cyclic Sequence Number (ECSN) (*x~e,1~, x~e,2~, x~e,3~*) (3
bits)

\- Resource duration indicator (3 bits if present) (*x~r,1~, x~r,2~,
x~r,3~*) -- \[the presence of this field is configured by higher
layers\]

\- E-HICH Indicator (x~EI,1~,x~EI,2~) (2 bits) (for 1.28Mcps TDD only)

\- E-UCCH Number Indicator (x~ENI,1~,x~ENI,2~, x~ENI,3~) (3 bits) (for
1.28Mcps TDD only)

Figure 25 illustrates the overall coding chain for the E-AGCH on one
carrier.

### 4.10.1 Information Field Mapping

#### 4.10.1.1 Mapping of the Absolute Grant (Power) Value

The absolute grant (power) value (*x~pg,1~, x~pg,2~,...x~pg,5~*) is
represented by 5 bits and corresponds to a dB value as specified in
table 26 for 3.84Mcps and 7.68 Mcps TDD and in table 26A for 1.28Mcps
TDD below. The values are mapped such that *x~pg,1~* corresponds to the
MSB of the index.

#### 4.10.1.2 Mapping of the Code Resource Related Information

The code resource related information (*x~c,1~, x~c,2~,...x~c,Nc~*)
indicates which node on the OVSF code tree has been allocated and is
represented by *N~c~* bits where *N~c~*=5 for 1.28Mcps and 3.84Mcps and
*N~c~*=6 for 7.68Mcps. The mapping between the allocated OVSF and the
enumerated node 0...30 (for 1.28Mcps and 3.84Mcps) and 0...62 (for
7.68Mcps) on the OVSF code tree is as given in table 27 below, in which
channelisation code \"*i\"* with spreading factor *\"Q\"* is denoted as
*C~i~^(Q)^*. *x~c,1~* corresponds to the MSB of the enumerated node. The
right-most column of table 27 is only applicable for the 7.68Mcps
option.

information (*x~t,1~, x~t,2~,...x~t,nTRRI~*) is a bitmap of length
n~TRRI~ indicating which of the timeslots configured for E-DCH use by
higher layers have been allocated. The length of the field (n~TRRI~) is
configured by higher layers up to a maximum of 12 bits. The bitmap is
arranged such that the corresponding timeslots are in ascending
numerical order, with *x~t,1~* corresponding to LSB and lowest-numbered
timeslot configured for E-DCH use.

For 1.28Mcps option, the timeslot resource related information (*x~t,1~,
x~t,2~,...x~t,nTRRI~*) is also a bitmap of length 5 indicating the
allocation for E-DCH resources from TS1 to TS5. If the bit is set (i.e.
equal to 1), then the corresponding timeslot shall be used for E-DCH
resources. The bitmap is arranged such that the corresponding timeslots
are in ascending numerical order, with *x~t,1~* corresponding to MSB.

### 4.10.3 CRC attachment

The E-RNTI (*x~id,1~, x~id,2~, \..., x~id,16~)* is the E‑DCH Radio
Network Identifier defined in \[12\]. It is mapped such that
*x~id,1\ ~*corresponds to the MSB.

From the sequence of bits *x~ag,1~*, *x~ag,2~*, \..., *x~ag,w~* a 16 bit
CRC is calculated according to section 4.2.1.1. This gives the sequence
of bits *c~1~*, *c~2~*, \..., *c~16~* where:

$c_{k} = p_{\text{im}(\text{17} - k)}$ *k=1,2,...,16*

This sequence of bits is then masked with *x~id,1~, x~id,2~, \...,
x~id,16~* and appended to the sequence of bits *x~ag,1~*, *x~ag,2~*,
\..., *x~ag,w~* to form the sequence of bits *y~1~*, *y~2~*, \...,
*y~w+16~ where*

timeslot resource related information, ECSN, field flag, special
information 1, special information 2 and E-UCCH number indicator are
multiplexed together to give a sequence of bits *x~ag,1~, x~ag,2~, ...,
x~ag,w~* where:

x~ag,k~ = x~pg,k~ k=1, 2, .., 5

x~ag,k~ = x~c,k-5~ k=6, 7, \..., 9

x~ag,k~ = x~t,k-9~ k=10,11, \..., 14

4.10B Coding for E-AGCH orders 
------------------------------

E-AGCH orders are commands sent to the UE using E-AGCH. No E-PUCH
resources grants are associated with E-AGCH orders.

The following information is transmitted by means of the E-AGCH order
physical channel.

\- Order type (3 bits): *x~odt,1~, x~odt,2~, x~odt,3~*

\- UE identity (16 bits): *x~id,1~, x~id,2~, ..., x~id,16~*

The coding for E-AGCH orders is specified in subclause 4.10A.

### 4.10B.1 E-AGCH orders information field mapping

#### 4.10B.1.1 Order type mapping

If *x~odt,1~, x~odt,2~, x~odt,3~*= \'*000*\', then the E-AGCH order is
an order to release the allocated semi-persistent E-PUCH resources when
UE is in CELL\_DCH state.

#### 4.10B.1.2 UE identity mapping

The E-RNTI (*x~id,1~, x~id,2~, \..., x~id,16~)* is the E‑DCH Radio
Network Identifier defined in \[12\]. It is mapped such that
*x~id,1\ ~*corresponds to the MSB.

4.11 Coding for E-HICH ACK/NACK
-------------------------------

### 4.11.1 Coding for E-HICH ACK/NACK for the 3.84Mcps and 7.68Mcps options

#### 4.11.1.1 Overview

The ACK/NACK is transmitted on the E‑HICH as described in \[7\].

The value of a binary HARQ acknowledgement indicator for user *h* is
denoted \"a~h~\" and may assume the value 0 or 1. The value of the
indicator is mapped as shown in table 28.

Table 28 -- Mapping of HARQ acknowledgement indicator

  --------- ---------------------------------------------
  Command   HARQ acknowledgement indicator value (a~h~)
  NACK      0
  ACK       1
  --------- ---------------------------------------------

A HARQ acknowledgement indicator is mapped to one of 240 signature
sequences of length 240 bits and represented by the bit sequence b~h,0~,
b~h,1~, ..., b~h,239~ for the *h^th^* acknowledgement indicator. The
signature sequence number \"r\" is selected as described in \[7\].

The signature sequence b~h,0~, b~h,1~, ..., b~h,239~ is constructed via
coding of a~h~ followed by bit scrambling. Spare bits are inserted
during the physical channel mapping stage to produce the output sequence
d~h,0~, d~h,1~, ..., d~h,U,~.

#### 4.11.1.2 Coding of the HARQ acknowledgement indicator

Bit a~h~ is used to form the sequence s~2,v~ (v=0,1,...,239) via a
two-stage serialised binary spreading process as shown in figure 26.

Figure 26

The output of the first spreading stage is
$s_{1,k} = a_{h} \oplus C_{1,i,k}$ , where *k=0, 1, 2,..., 19*.

The output of the second spreading stage is
$s_{2,v} = s_{1,w} \oplus C_{2,j,m}$ , where *v=0, 1,..., 239* and where
$w = \left\lfloor \frac{v}{\text{12}} \right\rfloor$ and,
$m = v\ \text{mod}\ \text{12}$.

The binary sequences selected for the first (C~1,i,k~) and second
(C~2,j,m~) spreading operations are derived as a function of the HARQ
acknowledgement sequence number *r* (see \[7\]) such that:

The first orthogonal sequence set (C~1,i,k~) is given by table 29 and
the second orthogonal sequence set (C~2,j,m~) is given by table 30.

#### 4.11.1.3 Bit scrambling of the E-HICH

The bit sequence b~h,0,~b~h,1~,...,b~h,239~ is formed by applying bit
scrambling (as defined in subclause 4.2.9) to the sequence s~2,v~.

#### 4.11.1.4 Physical channel mapping of the E-HICH

The bit sequence b~h,0,~b~h,1~,...,b~h,239~ is segmented into two
halves, b~h,0,~, ..., b~h,119~, and b~h,120,~...,b~h,239~. A sequence of
U spare bits z~u~ (*u=0...U-1*) are inserted between the first and
second half of the sequence to form:

d~h~ = {b~h,0~, b~h,1~, ... , b~h,119~, z~0~, z~1~, ... z~U-1~,
b~h,120~, b~h,121~, ... , b~h,239~}

U is equal to 4 or 36 dependant on the burst type (see \[7\]). The spare
bit sequence z~u~ is not defined.

### 4.11.2 Coding for E-HICH for the1.28Mcps option only

#### 4.11.2.1 Overview

The scheduled and non-Scheduled transmissions on different E‑HICHs are
described in \[7\]. The acknowledgement indicators for the E-DCH
semi-persistent scheduling operation can be transmitted on the same
E-HICH carrying indicators for scheduled traffic or the E-HICH carrying
indicators for non-scheduled traffic as described in \[7\].

For 1.28Mcps TDD multi-carrier E-DCH transmission, the acknowledgement
indicators for the E-PUCH on one carrier is associated with the E-HICHs
on the same carrier. The E-HICHs on the different carriers are coded
independently.

The value of a binary HARQ acknowledgement indicator for user *h* is
denoted \"a~h~\" and may assume the value 0 or 1. The value of the
indicator is mapped as same as that of 3.84Mcps shown in subclause
4.11.1.1.

Construction of the bit sequence for the *h*^th^ acknowledgement
indicator is achieved via a spreading process using an orthogonal
sequence which is the row of an orthogonal matrix of order 80. This
orthogonal matrix (C~80~) is Kronecker tensor product of one Hadamard
matrix of order 20 (C~20~) and another Hadamard matrix of order 4
(C~4~),

is Kronecker tensor product. (note: Kronecker product is not
commutative, i.e. ). The element \"0\" in Hadamard C~20~ and C~4~ shall
be replaced by \"-1\" before the Kronecker tensor product operation. And
after the operation the elements \"-1\" in C~80~ should be converted
back into \"0\".

These two Hadamard matrices are given by table 31 and table 32.

The binary orthogonal sequence (C~80,r,n~) used for spreading operation
is selected from the r^th^ row of the orthogonal matrix of order 80
(C~80~). A HARQ acknowledgement indicator is synchronously linked with
the E-DCH TTI transmission to which it relates. There is thus a
one-to-one association between an E-DCH TTI transmission and its
respective HARQ acknowledgement indicator.

#### 4.11.2.2 Coding of the HARQ acknowledgement indicator and TPC/SS

For scheduled transmissions, E-HICHs carry HARQ acknowledgement
indicators only.

When the special default midamble allocation scheme is not used for
E-PUCH, a logical allocation resource tag ID \"r\" (r=0, 1, 2,..., 79)
is calculated first for the E-DCH resource allocation associated with
the HARQ acknowledgement indicator.

where:

t~0~ is the last (highest-numbered) allocated timeslot (1,2,..,5)

q~0~ is the lowest-numbered channelisation code index allocated in
timeslot t~0~ (1,2,..., Q~0~)

Q~0~ is the spreading factor of the lowest-numbered channelisation code
index allocated in timeslot t~0~

When the special default midamble allocation scheme is used for E-PUCH,
a logical allocation resource tag ID \"r\" (r=0, 1, 2,..., 79) is
calculated first associated with the HARQ acknowledgement indicator.

where:

t~0~, q~0~ and Q~0~ have the same definition as above .

Offset is decided by the special default midamble pattern indicator on
E-AGCH and the mapping in Table33 below applies.

Table 33: Offset mapping table

  -------------- ------------ ------------
  ***offset***   *x~mpi,1~*   *x~mpi,2~*
  0              0            0
  1              0            1
  2              1            0
  3              1            1
  -------------- ------------ ------------

The logical resource tag ID r is then mapped to a physical allocation
resource tag ID r\',

$r' = P(r,\text{SFN}\text{',}\text{MidambleCode})$,

where *P* is a permutation function depends on the logical signature
index *r*, system sub-frame number SFN\' of E-HICH and the cell specific
basic midamble code sequence. A 7-tap linear feedback shift register
(LFSR) is used to generate pseudo-random numbers which are then used to
generate the pseudo-random permutation *P*. The generator polynomial of
the 7-tap LFSR is $g(x) = 1 + x^{3} + x^{7}$, as shown in Figure 27.

Figure 27: Structure of PN register

The pseudo-random permutation is generated according to the following
procedures:

1\. Initialization

\(a\) Initialize *M* = 80, initialize *P* as *P*(*m*) = *m*, *m* = 0, 1,
..., *M*-1;

\(b\) Initialize *N* = 7;

\(c\) Initialize PN register with seed *s*, where *s* = LSB(SFN\',
*[N]{.underline}*)⊕LSB(MidambleCode, *N*) and s~6~, s~5~, ... s~0~ are
put into the register in the order as shown in figure 27;

\(d\) Initialize *i* = 0.

2\. Repeat the following steps while *i* \<= *M* -- 3.

\(a\) Find the smallest *p* such that *M* -- *i* -- 1 \< 2*^p^*;

\(b\) Clock the PN register *N* times to obtain an *N*-bit pseudorandom
number x. Set *k* = LSB(*x*, *p*);

\(c\) If *k* \> *M* -- *i* -- 1, set *k* = *k* -- (*M* -- *i*);

\(d\) Swap the *i*-th and the (*k*+*[i]{.underline}*)-th element of *P*,
i.e., tmp = *P*(*i*), *P*(*i*) = *P*(*k*+*i*), *P*(*k*+*i*) = tmp;

\(e\) Increment *i* by 1.

where \"LSB(*x*, *n*)\" means the right most n bits of *x*, \"⊕\" means
modulo 2 addition, and the first output bit from the PN register is the
MSB, while the final output bit is the LSB . The resulting *P* is the
output permutation and the physical signature sequence index is given by
$r' = P(r)$.

The output of the spreading stage is equal to
$b_{h,n} = a_{h}\text{ΘC}_{\text{80},r\text{',}n}$, where n=0,1,...,79
and $\Theta$ is the Xor operation.

For Non-Scheduled transmissions and E-DCH semi-persistent scheduling
operation,, E-HICHs carry HARQ acknowledgement indicators and TPC/SS
commands. The 80 orthogonal sequences are divided into 20 groups while
each group includes 4 sequences of contiguous logical resource tag ID.
The mapping between the logical resource tag ID and the physical tag ID
is same as scheduled transmissions. Each non-scheduled user is assigned
one group by higher layer to indicate the HARQ acknowledgement indicator
and TPC/SS command. The first one of the four sequences is used for the
acknowledgement indicator\'s spreading operation and one of the other
three is used to indicate TPC/SS command implicitly. The mapping
relations between them are described in \[7\].

The HARQ acknowledgement indicator is spread by the assigned orthogonal
sequence (C~80,s\',n~), where s\' is the physical resource tag ID. The
output of the spreading stage is equal
to$c_{h,n} = a_{h}\text{ΘC}_{\text{80},s\text{',}n}$, where
n=0,1,...,79. The sequence chosen to indicate TPC/SS command is denoted
as \"e~h,n~\", $e_{h,n} = p_{h}\text{ΘC}_{\text{80},t\text{',}n}$, where
$p_{h}$ is the same as the parameter B defined in \[7\].

#### 4.11.2.3 Bit scrambling and Physical channel mapping of the E-HICH

For scheduled transmission, the bit sequence b~h,0,~b~h,1~,...,b~h,79~
is segmented into two halves, b~h,0,~, ..., b~h,39~, and
b~h,40,~...,b~h,79~. 8 spare bits z~u~ (*u=0...7*) are inserted between
the first and second half of the sequence to form:

d~h~ = {b~h,0~, b~h,1~, ... , b~h,39~, z~0~, z~1~, ... z~7~, b~h,40~,
b~h,41~, ... , b~h,79~}

The spare bit sequence z~u~ is not defined.For Non-Scheduled
transmission, the corresponding output bit sequences are:

d~h1~ = {c~h,0~, c~h,1~, ... , c~h,39~, z~0~, z~1~, ... z~7~, c~h,40~,
c~h,41~, ... , c~h,79~}

d~h2~ = {e~h,0~, e~h,1~, ... , e~h,39~, z~0~, z~1~, ... z~7~, e~h,40~,
e~h,41~, ... , e~h,79~}

Then the corresponding bit sequence d~h~ or d~h1~/d~h2~ is formed by
applying bit scrambling (as defined in subclause 4.2.9) to the sequence
s~h,n~ or s~h1,n~/s~h2,n~, n= 0,1,...,87.

4.12 Coding for E-RUCCH
-----------------------

For 1.28Mcps TDD, E-RUCCH supports both a 5ms and a 10ms TTI. For
3.84Mcps and 7.68Mcps TDD, E-RUCCH supports a TTI of 10ms only. The
sequence of 39 information bits to be transmitted on one E-RUCCH as
supplied by higher layers is defined as bits
$x_{e - \text{rucch},1},a_{e - \text{rucch},2},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.}a_{e - \text{rucch},\text{39}}$.

The following processing steps (in sequential order) are defined for
E-RUCCH:

\- CRC attachment

\- Channel coding

\- Rate matching

\- Bit scrambling

\- Frame related 2^nd^ interleaving

\- Mapping to physical channels

### 4.12.1 CRC attachment for E-RUCCH

From the sequence of A~i~=39 bits
($x_{e - \text{rucch},1},a_{e - \text{rucch},2},\text{.}\text{.}\text{.}a_{e - \text{rucch},\text{39}}$)
a CRC of length L~i~=16 is appended according to Section 4.2.1.1. The
bits output from CRC attachment are denoted b~im,k~, where *k=1,2,3, ...
A~i~+L~i~* and *A~i~* = 39

For 3.84Mcps and 7.68Mcps TDD, each parity bit b~im,k~ , (where
*k=A~i~+1,A~i~+2, ... A~i~+L~i~*) is then XOR\'d with 1 such that its
polarity is reversed.

### 4.12.2 Channel coding for E-RUCCH

1/3 rate convolutional channel coding is applied to the sequence *b~1~*,
*b~2~*, ..., *b~im,k~* in accordance with section 4.2.3.1, resulting in
the sequence of bits *z~1~*, *z~2~*, ..., *z~3(k+8)~*.

### 4.12.3 Rate matching for E-RUCCH

Rate matching for E-RUCCH shall be applied to the input sequence *z~1~*,
*z~2~*, ..., *z~3(k+8)~ to* obtain the output sequence *r~1~*, *r~2~*,
..., *r~U~*, where U = 176 for 1.28Mcps and U= 232 for 3.84Mcps and
7.68Mcps TDD, according to the general method described in subclause
4.2.7.

### 4.12.4 Bit scrambling for E-RUCCH

Bit scrambling for E-RUCCH shall be performed in accordance with the
general method described in subclause 4.2.9.

accordance with the general method described in subclause 4.2.11.1.

### 4.12.6 Physical channel mapping for E-RUCCH

Physical channel mapping for the E-RUCCH shall be performed in
accordance with the general method described in subclause 4.2.12.1.

5 Multiplexing, channel coding and interleaving for the 3.84 Mcps MBSFN IMB option
==================================================================================

5.1 General
-----------

Data streams from/to MAC and higher layers (Transport block / Transport
block set) are encoded/decoded to offer transport services over the
radio transmission link. The channel coding scheme is a combination of
error detection, error correcting, rate matching, interleaving and the
mapping of transport channels onto physical channels.

5.2 General coding/multiplexing of TrCHs
----------------------------------------

This section only applies to the transport channels BCH and FACH.

Data arrives to the coding/multiplexing unit in form of transport block
sets once every transmission time interval. The transmission time
interval is transport-channel specific from the set {10 ms, 20 ms, 40
ms, 80 ms}. An overview of the coding/multiplexing steps applicable to
MBSFN IMB is shown in figure 2 of subclause 4.2 in \[3\].

### 5.2.1 CRC attachment

Error detection is provided on transport blocks through a Cyclic
Redundancy Check (CRC). CRC attachment shall be performed in accordance
with the general method described in subclause 4.2.1 of \[3\].

### 5.2.2 Transport block concatenation and code block segmentation

Transport blocks, with attached CRCs, are concatenated and segmentated
into code blocks. Transport block concatenation and code block
segmentation shall be performed in accordance with the general method
described in subclause 4.2.2 of \[3\].

### 5.2.3 Channel coding

Code blocks are delivered to the channel coding. Channel coding shall be
performed in accordance with the general method described in subclause
4.2.3 of \[3\]. The following restrictions apply:

\- Convolutional coding shall be applied to FACH transport channel
mapped on S-CCPCH frame type 1 only.

\- Turbo coding shall be applied to FACH transport channels mapped on
S-CCPCH frame type 2 only.

### 5.2.4 1^st^ Interleaving

First interleaving shall be performed in accordance with the general
methods described in subclause 4.2.5 of \[3\].

is only relevant. Only flexible positions of TrCHs are supported for the
MBSFN IMB option.

For S-CCPCH frame type 2, the number of bits available to the CCTrCH in
one radio frame using *P* physical channels is defined as
*N~data,\*\ ~*= 3×*N~data~*~1~*+ (P-1)*×3× *N\'~data~*~1~, where
*N~data~*~1~ is defined in \[2\] and *N\'~data~*~1~ is the data size of
the corresponding slot format with zero TFCI bits.

### 5.2.7 TrCH multiplexing

Transport channel multiplexing shall be performed in accordance with the
general method described in subclause 4.2.8 of \[3\].

### 5.2.8 Insertion of discontinuous transmission (DTX) indication bits

DTX is used to fill up the radio frame with bits. The DTX indication
bits inserted in this step shall be placed at the end of the radio
frame, corresponding to flexible positions of TrCHs in the radio frame
\[3\]. Note that the DTX indication bits will be distributed over all
slots after 2^nd^ interleaving.

The bits input to the DTX insertion block are denoted
by![](media/image214.wmf){width="0.9305555555555556in" height="0.25in"},
where *S* is the number of bits from TrCH multiplexing. The bits output
from the DTX insertion block are denoted
by$w_{1},w_{2},w_{3},\ldots,w_{W}$and defined by the following
relations:

![](media/image215.wmf){width="0.5138888888888888in" height="0.25in"} *k
=* 1, 2, 3*,* ...*,S*

![](media/image216.wmf){width="0.5in" height="0.25in"} *k = S*+1*,
S*+2*, S*+3*,* ...*,W*

where DTX indication bits are denoted by *δ*. Note that bits *w~k~* are
three valued and that *W* = *N~data,\*~*.

### 5.2.9 Physical channel segmentation

For the 3.84 Mcps MBSFN IMB option, physical channel segmentation is
applicable to S-CCPCH frame type 2 only.

When more than one PhCH is used, physical channel segmentation divides
the bits among the different PhCHs. The bits input to the physical
channel segmentation are denoted by$w_{1},w_{2},w_{3},\ldots,w_{W}$,
where *W* is the number of bits input to the physical channel
segmentation block. The number of PhCHs is denoted by *P.*

The bits after physical channel segmentation are
denoted![](media/image123.wmf){width="1.4722222222222223in"
height="0.2777777777777778in"}, where *p* is PhCH number and *U~p~* is
the number of bits in one radio frame of the *p^th^* PhCH. The relation
between *w~k~* and *u~p,k~* is given below.

Bits on first PhCH after physical channel segmentation:

$u_{1,k} = w_{k}$ *k =* 1, 2 , ..., *U~1~*

Bits on second PhCH after physical channel segmentation:

$u_{2,k} = w_{(k + U_{1})}$ *k =* 1, 2 , ..., *U~2~*

...

Bits on the *P^th^* PhCH after physical channel segmentation:

$u_{P,k} = w_{(k + U_{1} + \ldots + U_{P - 1})}$ *k =* 1, 2 , ...,
*U~P~*

The number of bits *U~p\ ~*in one radio frame of the *p^th^* PhCH is
3×*N~data~*~1~ for *p=1* and 3×*N\'~data~*~1~ for *p = 2,3,*...*, P*,
where *N~data~*~1~ is defined in \[2\] and *N\'~data~*~1~ is the data
size of the corresponding slot format with zero TFCI bits.

### 5.2.10 2^nd^ Interleaving

Second interleaving is performed in accordance with the general method
described in section 4.2.11 of \[3\]. For S-CCPCH frame type 2, 2^nd^
interleaving is performed per physical channel of the CCTrCH.

### 5.2.11 Physical channel mapping

Physical channel mapping shall be performed in accordance with the
general method described in subclause 4.2.12 in \[3\], in which the
downlink description is only relevant.

### 5.2.12 Restrictions on different types of CCTrCHs

Restrictions on the different types of CCTrCHs are described in general
terms in \[16\]. In this subclause those restrictions are given with
layer 1 notation.

#### 5.2.12.1 Broadcast channel (BCH)

The restrictions of subclause 4.2.13.6 of \[3\] apply.

#### 5.2.12.2 Forward access channel (FACH)

\- The maximum value of the number of TrCHs *I* in a CCTrCH and the
maximum value of the number of transport blocks *M~i~* on each transport
channel are given from the UE capability class.

\- Only one Secondary CCPCH frame type 1 is used per CCTrCH.

\- The maximum number of Secondary CCPCHs of frame type 2 used per
CCTrCH is defined in \[17\].

### 5.2.13 Multiplexing of different TrCHs into one CCTrCH, and mapping of one CCTrCH onto physical channels

Multiplexing of different transport channels into one coded composite
transport channel shall be performed in accordance with the general
method described in 4.2.14 of \[3\].

5.3 Transport format detection
------------------------------

For MBSFN IMB operations, the transport format combination is signalled
using the TFCI field of an S-CCPCH slot and only TFCI based detection
shall be used.

### 5.3.1 Transport format detection based on TFCI

When a TFCI is available, then TFCI based detection shall be applicable
to all TrCHs within the CCTrCH. The TFCI informs the receiver about the
transport format combination of the CCTrCHs. As soon as the TFCI is
detected, the transport format combination, and hence the transport
formats of the individual transport channels are known.

### 5.3.2 Coding of Transport-Format-Combination Indicator (TFCI) 

The number of TFCI bits to be encoded per CCTrCH shall always be within
the range 1 to 5. These bits shall be encoded according to the general
method of subclause 4.3.1.2.2 to produce 16 encoded bits b0 to b15. This
procedure is valid also for the case where the number of TFCI bits to be
encoded is less than 3.

### 5.3.3 Mapping of TFCI words

#### 5.3.3.1 Mapping of TFCI bits for Secondary CCPCH

The 16 encoded TFCI bits are directly mapped to the S-CCPCH slots of the
radio frame. Within a slot the bit with lower index is transmitted
before the bit with higher index. The coded bits *b~k~*, are mapped to
the transmitted TFCI bits *d~k~*, according to the following formula:

*d~k~* = *b~k~* ~mod\ 16~

For S-CCPCH frame type 1, *k* = 0, 1, 2, ..., 29. For S-CCPCH frame type
2 using QPSK data modulation, *k* = 0, 1, 2, ..., 47 whilst for S-CCPCH
frame type 2 using 16-QAM data modulation, *k* = 0, 1, 2, ..., 23.

The set of TFCI bits *d~k~* shall be modulated as defined in \[9\] and
mapped to slots of the radio frame such that they are transmitted in
ascending order of *k*.
