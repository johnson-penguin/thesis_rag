Foreword
========

This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

*1* Scope
=========

The present document specifies the signalling transport related to PCAP
signalling to be used across the Iupc interface. The Iupc interface is a
logical interface for the interconnection of Stand-Alone SMLC (SAS) and
Radio Network Controller (RNC) components of the Universal Terrestrial
Radio Access Network (UTRAN) for the UMTS system. The radio network
control signalling between these nodes is based upon the Position
Calculation Application Part (PCAP).

The following documents contain provisions which, through reference in
this text, constitute provisions of the present document.

● References are either specific (identified by date of publication,
edition number, version number, etc.) or non‑specific.

● For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.

● For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the case
of a reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), a
non-specific reference implicitly refers to the latest version of that
document *in the same Release as the present document*.

4 PCAP Signalling Bearer
========================

4.1 Introduction
----------------

This clause specifies the Signalling Bearer protocol stack that supports
the PCAP signalling protocol.

The following requirements on the Signalling Bearer can be stated:

\- provide reliable transfer of control plane signalling messages in
both connectionless mode and connection-oriented mode;

\- provide separate independent connections for distinguishing
individual transactions;

\- provide networking and routing functions;

\- provide redundancy in the signalling network;

\- provide load sharing.

4.2 Signalling Bearer
---------------------

The Iupc signalling bearer shall comply with the requirements of clause
5.2 in TS 25.422 \[1\].

4.3 Services Provided by the Signalling Bearer
----------------------------------------------

When considering the requirements that the upper layers, i.e. PCAP, have
on the Signalling Bearer, there are a number of services it has to
provide and a number of functions to perform. These numbers of services
that the signalling bearer shall provide, to the upper layers, are
stated in references ITU-T Rec. Q.711 \[2\], ITU-T Rec. Q.712 \[3\],
ITU-T Rec. Q.713 \[4\], ITU-T Rec. Q.714 \[5\], ITU-T Rec. Q.715 \[6\],
and ITU-T Rec. Q.716 \[7\].
