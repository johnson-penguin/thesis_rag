4 General
=========

4.1 Objective
-------------

The present document describes the functionality of the PDCP.

4.2 Overview on sublayer architecture
-------------------------------------

Figure 1 shows the model of the PDCP within the radio interface protocol
architecture. The radio interface protocol architecture is defined in
\[3\].

Every PS domain RAB is associated with one RB, which in turn is
associated with one PDCP entity. Each PDCP entity is associated with one
or two (one for each direction) RLC entities depending on the RB
characteristic (i.e.uni-directional or bi-directional) and RLC mode. The
PDCP entities are located in the PDCP sublayer.

Every PDCP entity uses zero, one or several different header compression
protocols. Each individual PDCP entity uses at most one instance of each
header compression protocol. Several PDCP entities may be defined for a
UE with each using the same or a different set of header compression
protocols. In this version of the specification, only two header
compression protocols, RFC 2507 \[6\] and ROHC \[8\], \[10\], are
supported.

Every CS domain voice RAB is associated with one RB, which in turn is
associated with one PDCP entity. Each PDCP entity is associated with two
UM RLC entities as CS voice RBs are always bi-directional. The PDCP
entities are located in the PDCP sublayer. The PDCP entity serving CS
service does not use header compression.

The PDCP sublayer is configured by upper layer \[2\] through the
PDCP-C-SAP.

Figure 1: PDCP structure

Figure 1 represents one possible structure for the PDCP sublayer and
should not restrict implementation. A PDCP entity is mapped to either
one AM RLC entity or one or two UM or TM RLC entities. When a PDCP
entity is mapped to two UM or TM RLC entities each RLC entity is used
for a different direction.

5 Functions
===========

PDCP provides its services to the NAS at the UE or the relay at the
Radio Network Controller (RNC).

The Packet Data Convergence Protocol shall perform the following
functions:

\- header compression and decompression of IP data streams (e.g., TCP/IP
and RTP/UDP/IP headers for IPv4 and IPv6) at the transmitting and
receiving entity, respectively.

\- transfer of user data. This function is used for conveyance of data
between users of PDCP services.

\- maintenance of PDCP sequence numbers for radio bearers that are
configured to support lossless SRNS Relocation or lossless DL RLC PDU
size change.

\- transfer of CS counter if the radio bearer is connected to a CS
domain radio access bearer.

\- add and remove the padding in PDCP PDU for octet alignment.

PDCP uses the services provided by the Radio Link Control (RLC)
sublayer.

5.1 Header Compression
----------------------

The header compression protocol is specific to the particular network
layer, transport layer or upper layer protocol combinations e.g. TCP/IP
and RTP/UDP/IP. The network layer protocol type, e.g. IP or PPP, is
indicated during PDP context activation as defined in \[1\]. The header
compression protocols and their parameters are configured by upper
layers for each PDCP entity. Compressor and decompressor initiated
signalling between peer PDCP entities, during operation, is accomplished
through in-band signalling.

### 5.1.1 Mapping of PID values

Depending on the configuration by upper layers (i.e. PDCP PDU type to be
used and header compressor protocol), the PDCP sublayer shall be able
to:

\- identify different types of header compression protocols;

\- if RFC2507:

\- distinguish different header compression protocol packet types within
a header compression protocol.

The above requirements are realised by utilising the PID field in the
PDCP PDU.

The mapping of the PID values shall follow the general rules listed
below:

\- PID values shall be mapped to the different packet types
independently at each PDCP entity;

\- PID value \"0\" shall indicate \"no compression\". PID value \"0\"
shall be used in a PDCP PDU containing in its Data field a PDCP SDU that
is unchanged by the Sender and that shall not be decompressed by the
Receiver.;

\- PID values are mapped in ascending order, starting from 1, for every
configured header compression protocol, in the order of configuration by
upper layer. The first available PID value is assigned to the first
packet type of the header compression protocol as defined in the
specification for this header compression protocol. PID values are
mapped for all the specified packet types defined for the header
compression protocol and in the order defined in subclause 5.1.2.2 and
5.1.3.3 for the respective header compression protocol;

\- PID values are re-mapped for the PDCP entity after any
reconfiguration of the header compression protocols for that entity.

The following table illustrates an example of the PID value mapping to
the packet types when five arbitrary header compression methods are
configured for one PDCP entity: RFC 2507\[6\], Methods A and B, ROHC
\[8\], \[10\] and Method C. Method A, Method B and Method C are
imaginary header compression protocols introduced for the purpose of
illustration.

### 5.1.2 IP Header Compression (RFC 2507)

The detailed operation of the RFC 2507 header compression protocol is
specified in IETF RFCÂ 2507Â \[6\]. The mechanisms related to error
recovery and packet reordering are also described in RFC 2507. These
mechanisms shall be included in the functionality of the header
compression supported by PDCP. The implementation of the RFC 2507 header
compression functionality is not covered in this specification and is
left to the implementation.

#### 5.1.2.1 Context identifiers

Context identifiers for RFC 2507 shall only be included in the RFC 2507
packet types format, as defined in \[6\].

#### 5.1.2.2 Mapping of PID values for RFC 2507

PID values shall be mapped to the RFC 2507 header compression packet
types in the order presented in Table 2 below where \"n\" is the number
of PID values already mapped to other protocol packet types.

  ----------- --------------------- --------------------------

#### 5.1.2.3 Management of Full Header transmission

Transmission of a full header packet may be controlled by the lower
layer information.

For a TCP stream, if the PDCP receives from lower layer the information
of failed transmission of a single packet, the PDCP may send the next
packet as a full header.

For a non-TCP stream, if the PDCP receives from lower layer the
information of successful transmission of a full header packet, the PDCP
may stop sending a full header packet that contains the same full header
as the previously transmitted one.

### 5.1.3 Robust Header Compression

The detailed operation of the, \"RObust Header Compression (ROHC)\"
protocol is specified in IETF RFC 3095Â \[8\] and IETF RFC 4815 \[10\].

#### 5.1.3.1 Context identifiers

The context of the ROHC protocol is defined in \[8\] and \[10\]. ROHC
can be configured to support one or several contexts. Each context is
identified by a value known as the context identifier (CID).

#### 5.1.3.2 Void

#### 5.1.3.3 Mapping of PID values

The following PID value shall be mapped to the robust header compression
protocol as presented in the table where n is the number of PID values
already assigned to other protocol packet types.

Table 4: Mapping of PID values for RFC 3905 header compression protocol

  ----------- --------------------- --------------------
  PID value   Optimisation method   Packet type
  n+1         RFC 3095, RFC 4815    ROHC packet format
  ----------- --------------------- --------------------

#### 5.1.3.4 Void

#### 5.1.3.5 Protocol Parameters

ROHC has two types of parameters \[8\], \[10\]:

\- configuration parameters: these are mandatory and must be configured
between compressor and decompressor peers.

> \- implementation parameters: these are optional and, when used,
> stipulate how the compression protocol operates.

These parameters are categorized in four different groups, as defined
below:

\- M: Mandatory and configured by upper layers.

\- MO: Parameters that must be supported and when used can only be
configured or triggered by upper layers.

\- O: Optional parameters that are not configured by upper layers. They
may be used locally (i.e. UTRAN and/or in UE).

\- N/A: These are not used in ROHC.

The usage and definition of the parameters shall be as specified below.

\- MAX\_CID (M): This is the maximum CID value that can be used. One CID
value shall always be reserved for uncompressed flows.

> \- LARGE\_CIDS: This is not configured by upper layers but inferred
> from the configured value of MAX\_CID according to the following rule:

If MAX\_CID \> 15 then LARGE\_CIDS = TRUE else LARGE\_CIDS = FALSE.

> \- PROFILES (M): Profiles are used to define which profiles are
> allowed to be used by the UE in uplink. In downlink, all the profiles
> defined in \[8\] shall be supported.
>
> \- FEEDBACK\_FOR (N/A):
>
> \- MRRU (M): Segmentation is not used by default.

\- NO\_OF\_PACKET\_SIZES\_ALLOWED (N/A).

\- PACKET\_SIZES\_ALLOWED (N/A)

\- PAYLOAD\_SIZES (O).

\- NO\_OF\_PACKET\_SIZES\_USED (O).

\- PACKET\_SIZES\_USED (O).

\- CONTEXT\_REINITIALIZATION (MO).

\- MODE (O).

\- CLOCK\_RESOLUTION (O).

\- REVERSE\_DECOMPRESSION\_DEPTH (M): Default value is that reverse
decompression is not used.

#### 5.1.3.6 Configuration by RRC

If the variable \"PDCP\_ROHC\_TARGET\_MODE\" \[2\] is stored in the UE,
and if applicable for the ROHC profile applied, the de-compressor shall
only perform the operational state transitions defined in \[8\] to the
stored mode.

If the variable \"PDCP\_ROHC\_TARGET\_MODE\" \[2\] is not stored in the
UE, the de-compressor shall not restrict the operational state
transitions defined in \[8\].

5.3 Data Transfer
-----------------

If header compression is configured the PDCP entity in the Sender shall:

\- perform header compression upon reception of a PDCP SDU from upper
layers;

\- if the radio bearer is configured for lossless SRNS Relocation or
lossless DL RLC PDU size change:

\- maintain PDCP sequence numbering as specified in subclause 5.6.1.1;

\- submit the PDCP PDU to lower layer in the sequence received from the
upper layer.

If radio bearer is connected to a CS domain radio access bearer, the
sender shall:

\- if the PDCP SDU length is of 1 or more bits:

\- include the CS counter in the PDCP AMR Data PDU as specified in
subclause 5.6.1.4;

\- indicate the PDCP AMR PDU type in the PDU type field;

\- fill the data field of the PDCP AMR PDU type with the PDCP SDU and
add padding bits as specified in subclause 8.2.4.

NOTE: If no AMR or AMR WB frames is generated by upper layers, no PDCP
PDU is submitted to the lower layer.

When the PDCP entity at the Receiver receives the PDCP PDU from lower
layers, it shall:

\- if the received PDCP PDU is of type PDCP AMR Data PDU:

\- the PDCP SDU is derived from the data field of the PDCP AMR Data PDU.
The receiver determines the bit aligned data content and Frame Type from
the PDU Data field length, as possible AMR and AMR WB payload has a
unique size when being octet aligned;

\- deliver the PDCP SDU and CS counter from the received PDCP header to
the upper layer.

\- else:

\- perform header decompression (if header compression is configured) of
the PDCP PDU to obtain the PDCP SDU; and

\- deliver the PDCP SDU to the upper layer in the order received from
the lower layer;

\- if the received PDCP PDU is of type PDCP SeqNum PDU:

\- follow the procedure in subclause 5.6.1.2.

### 5.3.1 Data transfer over acknowledged mode RLC

Figure 2 shows the PDCP data transfer over acknowledged mode RLC.

Figure 2: PDCP data transfer over acknowledged mode RLC

NOTE: If the primitive RLC-AM-DATA.req is used with parameter CNF, the
primitive RLC-AM-DATA.cnf is delivered. Otherwise, this primitive is not
delivered.

### 5.3.2 Data transfer over unacknowledged and transparent mode RLC

Figure 3 shows the PDCP data transfer over unacknowledged or transparent
mode RLC.

5.4 SRNS Relocation
-------------------

In case of SRNS Relocation upper layer indicates to PDCP to perform
either the re-initialisation or the context relocation of compression
protocols of an RB, or the release of the compression protocols of an
RB. In this version of the specification, context relocation is only
applicable to RFC3095. Each of the compression protocols is handled
independently, but the context relocation capability is optional for the
UE and it is indicated as a part of the UE radio access capabilities.

The re-initialisation of a given compression protocol entails the
following:

\- Compression parameters may be reconfigured by upper layers during
re-initialisation, otherwise compression parameters remain valid during
re-initialisation.

\- All compression state information is initialised, e.g. header
compression contexts. Therefore, the first \'compressed\' packet type
after SRNS Relocation is a full header.

\- The PDCP sequence numbers are not changed due to the PDCP header
compression protocol re-initialisation.

The context relocation of a given compression protocol entails the
following:

> \- Configured compression parameters remain valid during context
> relocation.
>
> \- A snapshot of the compression state information (context) is taken
> in the source RNC and transferred to the target RNC, which initialises
> the header compression protocol according to the transferred snapshot.
> Therefore, the (de)compression continues after SRNS Relocation from
> the context used before relocation.
>
> \- Some additional specific actions are performed both in UE and UTRAN
> during the SRNS Relocation in order to keep the (de)compressors
> consistent.

### 5.4.1 Lossless SRNS Relocation

Lossless SRNS Relocation is only applicable when RLC is configured for
in-sequence delivery and acknowledged mode. The support of lossless SRNS
Relocation is configured by upper layer.

For the support of lossless SRNS Relocation, the PDCP entities maintain
sequence numbers for PDCP SDUs, as described in subclause 5.6.1.1.

These sequence numbers are synchronised between PDCP Sender and
Receiver, as described in subclause 5.6.1.2.

When a lossless SRNS Relocation is performed sequence numbers are
exchanged between UE and UTRAN. They are used to confirm PDCP SDUs
transmitted but not yet acknowledged by the Receiver, as described in
subclause 5.6.1.3. After relocation the data transfer begins with the
first unconfirmed PDCP SDU.

#### 5.4.1.1 Void

#### 5.4.1.2 Void

#### 5.4.1.3 Void

### 5.4.2 Context relocation

The header compression context relocation is performed by the decision
of upper layers in source RNC based on the UE radio capabilities. The
decision is done independently every time the SRNS relocation occurs and
is specific for each header compression protocol. It is indicated to UE
as a part of the SRNS relocation signalling of the upper layer and the
selected relocation method is configured to UE PDCP by the upper layer.

The header compression context relocation shall not be performed if the
radio bearer is configured to support the lossless SRNS Relocation.

**In the UE**, upon reception of the indication about SRNS relocation
being performed:

\- the upper layer configures PDCP (*CPDCP-CONFIG.Req*) to perform
either re-initialisation (R) or the context relocation (C) of header
compression protocols;

\- if the context relocation is to be applied for RFC3095 header
compression protocol:

\- if the **compressor** (M-HC) is operating in **R mode**:

\- uplink data may be compressed and transmitted normally.

\- if the **compressor** (M-HC) is operating in **O mode**:

\- compress and transmit uplink data as specified in \[8\] using the
assumption that all ROHC uplink packets transmitted are likely to be
lost. When SRNS relocation is completed, M-HC should return to normal
operation.

> NOTE: When the M-HC is using the assumption that all ROHC uplink
> packets transmitted are likely to be lost:
>
> \- the M-HC can not transit to a higher compression state;
>
> \- for W-LSB encoding, the M-HC updates the set of candidate reference
> values used by the decompressor by adding newly transmitted values but
> not removing old values.

\- if the **compressor** (M-HC) is operating in **U mode**:

\- M-HC shall transit to FO state and send IR-DYN to re-synchronise the
dynamic part of the uplink context.

\- if the reverse decompression is applied in the **decompressor**
(M-HD):

-flush the reverse decompression buffer by discarding all packets in the
buffer.

\- in the **decompressor** (M-HD), in **all modes**:

\- downlink data may be received and decompressed normally.

**In the UTRAN source RNC**, while SRNS relocation is being performed:

\- if the context relocation is to be applied for RFC3095 header
compression protocol:

\- PDCP is requested to take a context snapshot by the upper layer
(*CPDCP-CONTEXT.Req*);

\- if the **compressor** (source N-HC) is operating in **R mode**:

\- the source N-HC should take a snapshot of its header compression
compressor context (denoted *N-context-C\**);

\- header compression contexts should not be updated anymore even though
downlink data may be compressed and transmitted otherwise normally. This
can be done by sending R-1\* packets.

\- if the **compressor** (source N-HC) is operating in **O mode**:

\- the source N-HC should take a snapshot of its header compression
compressor context (denoted *N-context-C\**);

\- after the snapshot is taken, the source N-HC should only send UO-0 or
UO-1\* packets. This means only RTP SN, RTP TS, and IP-ID (for IPv4
only) fields are updated in the decompressor context at M-HD.

\- if the **compressor** (source N-HC) is operating in **U mode**:

\- the source N-HC should take a snapshot of the static part of its
header compression compressor context (denoted *N-context-C-static\**).

\- if the **decompressor** (source N-HD) is operating in **R or O
mode**:

\- if the source N-HD is sure about the integrity of the *N-context-D:*

\- the source N-HD should take a snapshot of its header compression
decompressor context (denoted as *N-context-D\**).

\- if the source N-HD is only sure about the integrity of the static
part of the *N-context-D* (e.g. due to multiple detected errors):

\- the source N-HD should take a snapshot only of the static part of the
*N-context-D* (denoted as *N-context-D-static\**).

\- RFC3095 acknowledgments should not be generated anymore even though
uplink data may be received and decompressed otherwise normally.

\- if the **decompressor** (source N-HD) is operating in **U mode**:

\- the source N-HD should take a snapshot of the static part of its
header compression decompressor context (denoted
*N-context-D-static\**).

\- either *N-context-C\** or *N-context-C-static\** and either
*N-context-D\** or *N-context-D-static\** should be delivered to the
upper layer as *Context-Info (CPDCP-CONTEXT.Conf)*, which is to be
transmitted further to the target RNC.

**In the UTRAN target RNC**, while SRNS relocation is being performed:

\- the upper layer configures PDCP (*CPDCP-CONFIG.Req*) to perform
either initialisation (I) or the context relocation (C) of header
compression protocols;

\- the new header compression entity should be created;

\- if the context relocation is to be applied for RFC3095 header
compression protocol:

\- in the **compressor** (target N-HC), in **all modes**:

\- the header compression compressor (target N-HC) should be initialised
to the same mode as used in the source N-HC using *N-context-C\** as the
initial header compression compressor context;

\- in addition, if the source N-HC was operating in U-mode, the target
N-HC should first send IR-DYN to resynchronise the dynamic part of the
downlink context.

\- in the **decompressor** (target N-HD), in **all modes**:

\- if *Context-Info* carries N-context-D\*:

\- the header compression decompressor (target N-HD) should be
initialised to the same mode as used in the source N-HD using
*N-context-D\** as the initial header compression decompressor context.

\- if *Context-Info* carries N-context-D-static\*:

\- the header compression decompressor (target N-HD) should be
initialised to the same mode as used in the source N-HD using
N-context-D-static\* as the initial header compression decompressor
context;

\- the target N-HD should send a request for IR-DYN.

5.5 Lossless DL RLC PDU size change
-----------------------------------

Lossless DL RLC PDU size change is only applicable when RLC is
configured for in-sequence delivery and acknowledged mode. The support
of lossless DL RLC PDU size change is configured by upper layer.

For the support of lossless DL RLC PDU size change, the PDCP entities
maintain sequence numbers for DL PDCP SDUs, as described in subclause
5.6.1.1.

These DL sequence numbers are synchronised between PDCP Sender in the
UTRAN and Receiver in the UE, as described in subclause 5.6.1.2.

When a lossless DL RLC PDU size change is performed the next expected
DL\_Receive PDCP SN is sent from the UE to the UTRAN. It is used to
confirm DL PDCP SDUs transmitted but not yet acknowledged by the
Receiver in the UE, as described in subclause 5.6.1.3. After lossless DL
RLC PDU size change the data transfer begins with the first unconfirmed
DL PDCP SDU.

5.6 General procedures {#general-procedures .Style-Heading-2}
----------------------

#### 5.6.1.1 PDCP Sequence Numbering

The value of the PDCP sequence number ranges from 0 to 65535. The PDCP
SN window size indicates the maximum number of PDCP SDUs, not confirmed
to have been successfully transmitted to the peer entity by lower layer,
that can be numbered at any given time. The PDCP SN window size is
configured by upper layers. PDCP sequence numbers are set to \"0\" when
the PDCP entity is set-up for the first time.

In the following the \"submission/reception of a PDCP SDU to/from lower
layer\" is used as a synonym for the submission/reception of a PDCP Data
PDU or a PDCP SeqNum PDU to/from lower layer that carries in its Data
field a compressed or uncompressed PDCP SDU.

If lossless SRNS relocation and/or lossless DL RLC PDU size change
are/is supported by the UE, for each radio bearer configured to support
\"lossless SRNS relocation or lossless DL RLC PDU size change\" as
specified in \[1\], PDCP sequence numbers are applied:

\- in the UE:

\- the DL\_Receive PDCP SN shall be set to \"0\" for the first PDCP SDU
received from lower layer;

\- the DL\_Receive PDCP SN shall be incremented by \"1\" for the next
PDCP SDU received from lower layer.

\- in the UTRAN:

\- the DL\_Send PDCP SN should be set to \"0\" for the first PDCP SDU
submitted to lower layer;

\- the DL\_Send PDCP SN should be incremented by \"1\" for the next PDCP
SDU submitted to lower layer.

Additionally, if lossless SRNS relocation is supported by the UE, for
each radio bearer configured to support \"lossless SRNS relocation or
lossless DL RLC PDU size change\" as specified in \[1\], PDCP sequence
numbers are applied:

\- in the UE:

\- the UL\_Send PDCP SN shall be set to \"0\" for the first PDCP SDU
submitted to lower layer;

\- the UL\_Send PDCP SN shall be incremented by \"1\" for the next PDCP
SDU submitted to lower layer;

\- in the UTRAN:

\- the UL\_Receive PDCP SN should be set to \"0\" for the first PDCP SDU
received from lower layer;

> \- the UL\_Receive PDCP SN should be incremented by \"1\" for the next
> PDCP SDU received from lower layer.

PDCP sequence numbers shall not be decremented in a PDCP entity.

#### 5.6.1.2 PDCP Sequence Number synchronization

For radio bearers that are configured to support \"lossless SRNS
Relocation or lossless DL RLC PDU size change\" as specified in \[1\]:

the UE PDCP entity shall:

\- if the UE supports lossless SRNS relocation,

> \- if a PDCP entity has to synchronise the UL PDCP SN following a RLC
> reset or RLC transmitting side re-establishment not caused by a
> lossless SRNS Relocation; or
>
> \- if the UE PDCP entity receives an invalid \"next expected UL
> Receive PDCP SN\" from upper layer after a lossless SRNS Relocation;
>
> \- trigger the PDCP SN synchronisation procedure by submitting one
> PDCP SeqNum PDU to lower layer;
>
> \- consider that the synchronisation procedure is complete on
> confirmation by lower layer of the successful transmission of the PDCP
> SeqNum PDU.

\- if the UE supports lossless DL RLC PDU size change but not lossless
SRNS relocation, the UE PDCP entity shall not submit PDCP SeqNum PDU to
lower layer.

\- the UTRAN PDCP entity should:

\- if a PDCP entity has to synchronise the DL PDCP SN following a RLC
reset or RLC transmitting side re-establishment not caused by a lossless
SRNS Relocation or a lossless DL RLC size change; or

\- if the UTRAN PDCP entity receives an invalid \"next expected
DL\_Receive PDCP SN\" from upper layer after lossless SRNS Relocation or
lossless DL RLC PDU size change:

> \- trigger the PDCP SN synchronisation procedure by submitting one
> PDCP SeqNum PDU to lower layer;
>
> \- consider that the synchronisation procedure is complete on
> confirmation by lower layer of the successful transmission of the PDCP
> SeqNum PDU.

In the UE/UTRAN, the \"next expected UL/DL\_Receive PDCP SN\" is
considered invalid if its value is less than the UL/DL\_Send PDCP SN of
the first transmitted but not yet acknowledged PDCP SDU or greater than
that of the first unsent PDCP SDU.

On receiving a PDCP SeqNum PDU:

\- the UE PDCP entity shall:

\- set the value of the DL\_Receive PDCP SN to the value indicated in
the PDCP SeqNum PDU;

\- the UTRAN PDCP entity should:

\- set the value of the UL\_Receive PDCP SN to the value indicated in
the PDCP SeqNum PDU.

NOTE: If UTRAN has the intention to use only the lossless DL RLC PDU
size change, UTRAN may not maintain UL PDCP SN. In this case, UTRAN
should still transfer the user data to upper layer.

#### 5.6.1.3 Sequence Number and Data Forwarding

In case of a lossless SRNS Relocation procedure or lossless DL RLC size
change, as described in \[1\]:

\- the UE shall send to the UTRAN the next expected DL\_Receive PDCP SN.

Additionally, in case of lossless SRNS relocation procedure, as
described in \[1\]:

\- the UTRAN should send to the UE the next expected UL\_Receive PDCP
SN.

This information exchange synchronises the Sequence Numbers at the UE
and UTRAN PDCP entities.

When requested by the upper layer, for each radio bearer configured to
support lossless SRNS Relocation, the PDCP sublayer in the source RNC
should forward the following to the target RNC:

\- the UL\_Receive PDCP SN of the next PDCP SDU expected to be received
from the UE;

\- the DL\_Send PDCP SN of the first transmitted but not yet
acknowledged PDCP SDU;

\- the transmitted but not yet acknowledged PDCP SDUs together with
their related DL\_Send PDCP SNs;

\- the not yet transmitted PDCP SDUs.

#### 5.6.1.4 CS Counter Handling

In case the radio bearer is connected to a CS domain radio access
bearer, the CS counter shall be included in the PDCP AMR Data PDU.

The value of the CS counter shall be set to the first to fifth LSBs of
the CFN at which the packet has been received from higher layers.

In the receiving side, the CS counter shall be delivered to the upper
layer together with the PDCP SDU.

The CS counter is used to manage the delay jitter generated by the radio
layer. The CS counter plus the value of the information element \"Max CS
delay\", as signalled in \[2\], indicates the latest instance at which
the AMR or AMR WB frames is delivered to the upper layer.

5.7 Header Compression and Decompression for MBMS
-------------------------------------------------

Header compression and decompression for a p-t-m MBMS service is
performed in ROHC U-mode.

Applying ROHC for p-t-m RB configuration is optional and should be
configured per MBMS session.

### 5.7.1 Cell change inside the same cell group

When a UE moves to a cell that is the same cell group with that of the
previous cell while reciving a p-t-m MBMS service which is provided in
both cells, the UE shall:

\- continue header decompression during and after cell change.

### 5.7.2 Cell change between cell groups

When a UE moves to a cell that is the different cell group with that of
the previous cell while reciving a p-t-m MBMS service which is provided
in both cells, the UE shall:

\- reconfigure and re-initialise the PDCP entity;

\- reuse the static part of the header decompressor context used in the
previous cell;

\- re-initialise header decompression after receiving IR-DYN or IR
packet and correcting the CID of the context with the CID being used in
the new cell.

NOTE: How to correct CID is implementation issue and is not specified.

6 Services
==========

6.1 Services provided to upper layers
-------------------------------------

The following services are provided by PDCP to upper layers:

\- transfer of user data;

\- maintenance of PDCP SDU sequence numbers.

6.2 Services expected from RLC layer
------------------------------------

For a detailed description of the following functions see \[5\].

\- transparent data transfer Service;

\- unacknowledged data transfer Service;

\- acknowledged data transfer Service.

7 Elements for layer-to-layer communication
===========================================

The interaction between the PDCP layer and other layers are described in
terms of primitives where the primitives represent the logical exchange
of information and control between the PDCP layer and other layers. The
primitives shall not specify or constrain implementations.

7.1 Primitives between PDCP and upper layers

  --------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------ ------------- -----------------------------------

Each Primitive is defined as follows:

a\) PDCP-DATA-Req./Ind.

\- PDCP-DATA-Req is used by upper user-plane protocol layers to request
a transmission of upper layer PDU. PDCP-DATA-Ind is used to deliver PDCP
SDU that has been received to upper user plane protocol layers.

b\) CPDCP-CONFIG-Req.

\- CPDCP-CONFIG-Req is used to configure and -- in case of already
existing PDCP entity -- to reconfigure a PDCP entity and to assign it to
the radio bearer associated with that entity.

c\) CPDCP-RELEASE-Req.

\- CPDCP-RELEASE-Req is used by upper layers to release a PDCP entity.

d\) CPDCP-SN-Req.

\- This primitive is used at the UTRAN. CPDCP-SN-Req is used to transfer
the PDCP SN to PDCP.

e\) CPDCP-RELOC-Req/Conf.

\- CPDCP-RELOC-Req initiates the SRNS Relocation procedure in PDCP for
those radio bearers that are configured to support lossless SRNS
Relocation. The Next\_Receive\_SN is only included at the UE side.

\- CPDCP-RELOC-Conf is used to transfer the Next\_Receive\_SN and/or
Next\_Send\_SN to upper layers for lossless SRNS Relocation. The
Next\_Send\_SN is only included at the source RNC.

> f\) CPDCP-CONTEXT-Req./Conf.

\- CPDCP-CONTEXT-Req initiates specific actions in the source RNC in
order to perform context relocation as a part of the SRNS relocation.

8 Elements for peer-to-peer communication
=========================================

8.1 Protocol data units
-----------------------

Different PDU formats are defined for the PDCP protocol, one not
introducing any overhead to the (compressed) PDCP SDU, others
introducing such overhead.

8.2 Formats
-----------

A PDCP PDU shall be a multiple of 8 bits, if the RLC entity is
configured for unacknowledged or acknowledged mode. Otherwise, if the
RLC entity is configured for transparent mode, it is bit-aligned. In
Tables 6, 7 and 8, bit strings are represented as follows: the first bit
is the leftmost one on the first line of the table, the last bit is the
rightmost on the last line of the table, and more generally the bit
string is to be read from left to right and then in the reading order of
the lines.

SDUs are bit strings, with any non-null length. If not compressed within
PDCP an SDU is included from first bit onward.

### 8.2.1 PDCP-No-Header PDU

The PDCP-No-Header PDU does not introduce any overhead to the PDCP SDU.
The use of the PDCP-No-Header PDU is configured by the upper layer.

The format of the PDCP-No-Header PDU is shown in Table 6.

### 8.2.4 PDCP AMR Data PDU

The PDCP AMR Data PDU is used to convey:

\- a PDCP SDU containing AMR or AMR WB frame

The format of the PDCP AMR Data PDU is shown in Table 9.

The PDCP PDU is octet aligned but the actual PDCP SDU carrying the AMR
or AMR WB frame may not be octet aligned. The data field contains the
\"AMR Core Frame\" of AMR IF1 as defined in \[11\] or \"AMR-WB Core
Frame\" of AMR-WB IF1 as defined in \[12\]. The AMR classes are always
encoded in the order of class A, B and C, where d(0) of the \"AMR Core
Frame\" or \"AMR-WB Core Frame\" is carried in the first bit of data
field. Any padding for octet alignment is inserted at the end of the
data field.

8.3 Parameters
--------------

If not otherwise mentioned in the definition of each field then the bits
in the parameters shall be interpreted as follows: the left most bit
string is the first and most significant and the right most bit is the
last and least significant bit.

Unless otherwise mentioned, integers are encoded in standard binary
encoding for unsigned integers. In all cases the bits appear ordered
from MSB to LSB when read in the PDU.

### 8.3.1 PDU Type

Length: 3 bits.

The PDU type field indicates the PDCP Data PDU type.

  --------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Bit       PDU Type
  000       PDCP Data PDU (Table 7)
  001       PDCP SeqNum PDU (Table 8)

  ------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The PID field value indicates the used header compression protocol type
and packet type. A specific header compression protocol may utilize a
certain range of consecutive values from the PID field value space for
different packet types. The Receiving PDCP entity performs the necessary
operation (e.g. header decompression) according to the PID field value.

9 Handling of unknown, unforeseen and erroneous protocol data
=============================================================

9.1 Invalid PDU type
--------------------

If a PDCP entity receives a PDCP PDU with a PDU Type set to Reserved
(see subclause 8.3.1), it shall:

\- discard the PDCP PDU.

If a PDCP entity is not configured for lossless SRNS Relocation or
lossless DL RLC PDU size change and receives a PDCP SeqNum PDU, it
shall:

\- discard the PDCP SeqNum PDU.

9.2 Invalid PID value
---------------------

If a PDCP entity receives a PDCP PDU with a PID value that is not mapped
with a valid packet type (see subclause 5.1.1), it shall:

9.3 PDCP Unrecoverable Error Detection
--------------------------------------

For each radio bearer that is configured to perform PDCP Unrecoverable
Error Detection:

\- if the PDCP entity receives 2 or 3 consecutive PDCP PDUs with an
unexpected or invalid PDU Type or PID value:

\- the UE PDCP entity may indicate PDCP Unrecoverable Error to upper
layer \[2\].

\- if the PDCP entity receives 4 consecutive PDCP PDUs with an
unexpected or invalid PDU Type or PID value:

\- the UE PDCP entity shall indicate PDCP Unrecoverable Error to upper
layer \[2\].

NOTE1: Until the UE receives 4 consecutive PDCP PDUs with an unexpected
or invalid PDU Type or PID value, the UE may apply a self-recovery
mechanism. For example, the UE PDCP entity may indicate to RLC layer
that HFN can be incremented.

NOTE2: The PDCP unrecoverable error detection is performed before the
invalid PDU type check specified in subclause 9.1.

NOTE3: PDCP unrecoverable error detectionÂ in the UE can only detect the
problem in the downlink.

######## Annex A (normative): ROHC performance testing

A.1 Introduction {#a.1-introduction .Style-Heading-2}
----------------

This subclause defines performance test cases for ROHC. The ROHC profile
within scope is profile 0x0001 for compression of RTP/UDP/IP headers
only. This subclause is not meant to bring incoherent limitations to
implementations, and is not meant to create a sub-specification of
\[8\], \[10\] either, as a consequence of the requirements on
performance that it defines.

### A.1.1 Purpose of the performance testing

The purpose of the test cases is to ensure that ROHC implementations
meet minimal requirements that can fairly be expected when subjected to
an input sequence that includes frequently occurring and commonly
observed changes in the values of header fields. The metrics used
correspond to:

\- the average compressed header size for an entire test sequence, to
assess an implementation's efficiency in terms of its overall
compression ratio, and

\- the average compressed header size for different sub-sequences within
each test case, to assess an implementation's ability to minimize the
variance in compressed header size with respect to the selection of the
packet format used for individual packets.

The latter is to avoid a less desirable behaviour where a compressor
would consistently and exclusively use two types of compressed header
formats; one format that offers no compression but that completely
updates and/or repairs the context e.g. when the patterns of the header
fields to be compressed do not allow optimal compression, and another
format that provides the most efficient compression ratio otherwise.
While it is noted that the use of larger headers is perfectly acceptable
protocol-wise \[8\], the tests herein are meant to encourage compressor
implementations to actively and efficiently implement compression.

These metrics are defined so that they are not impacted by an
implementation's specific robustness algorithm(s) as well as to allow a
wide range of compression strategies.

Compressor implementations are expected to implement robustness
algorithms according to the optimistic approach for the U/O-modes of
operation. The optimistic approach is the part of the selection of the
packet format where a format that contains the necessary information to
update a field is used a number N time, starting from the packet for
which a new value has to be established in the decompressor context.
While N is an implementation parameter, the metrics for each sequence in
U/O-mode is expressed in terms of this parameter. Implementation should
use the value N as an input parameter for the testing, to adapt to the
expected robustness level required for the testing. The value of the
parameter N is defined in test case definition separately (informative
value is given in Annex B.2.3.). Similarly, R-mode operation requires
that an update be conveyed to the decompressor until it gets
acknowledged; however for R-mode, relevant test cases provide explicit
feedback messages when necessary.

The performance tests for ROHC as described in this subclause are
carried out by providing a sequence of uncompressed IP/UDP/RTP packets
to the ROHC RTP compressor, together with artificially generated
feedback messages that are synchronized with the packet sequence. All
packets in these sequences are built on the same base structure, with
most field values being constant. The performance test cases define
different change patterns for three specific fields: the IPv4 IP ID, the
RTP SN, and the RTP TS.

### A.1.2 Input sequence for uncompressed headers

The structure of the IPv4/UDP/RTP header and IPv6/UDP/RTP header is
outlined in annex A.3, along with tables of the values to be used for
each field. Fields with values marked ANY can have any value;, these are
the addressing fields that uniquely identify the flow of packets being
compressed and their respective value does not otherwise affect the
expected compression ratio as they are either sent in uncompressed form
or completely omitted in compressed packets. The checksum values are
dependent on the entire content of the packet and are calculated
according to their respective protocol specifications, RFC 768 and RFC
791, which are referred to in the tables. For the input sequence, the
UDP checksum with IPv4 shall always be enabled and thus have a non-zero
value, i.e the two octets of the UDP checksum are always included as
part of the calculation of the compressed header size for both IPv4 and
IPv6. Each test sequence defines specific values to create varying
change patterns for the IPv4 IP ID, the RTP SN, and the RTP TS. A dummy
payload of an arbitrary non-zero value shall be appended at the end of
the header data, following the RTP header.

The outline of each test case follows the same format with respect to
the input sequences and the requirements. Test 1a and 1b are base tests
using a well-behaving flow of packets as one of the inputs. All
subsequent tests are based on test 1a or test 1b, each with specific
test events added to the packet flow of the base tests.

### A.1.3 Feedback format for the test cases

The feedback messages used in the test cases, when applicable, are
artificially generated and interspersed with the input sequence of
uncompressed packets. Feedback messages are generated according to the
following format:

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

\| 1 1 1 1 0 \| Code \| feedback type octet

+\-\--+\--e\| Mode \| SN \|

+\-\--+\-\--+\-\--+\-\--N \|

+\-\--+\-\--+\-\--+\-\--+\-\--+\-\--+ 0 1 \|

+\-\--+\-\--+\-\--+\-\--+\-\--+\-\--+\-\--+\-\--+

+\-\--+\-\--+\-\--+\-\--+\-\--+\-\--+\-\--+\-\--+

Where:

-eedback data above the type octet is 4 octets)

\- Acktype is set to 0x0 (means ACK)

\- Mode is set as defined by the test case

\- SN is set as defined by the test case

\- CRC is the 8-bit CRC computed over the entire feedback payload
including any CID fields but excluding the packet type, the \'Size\'
field and the \'Code\' octet, using the polynomial defined in \[8\],
\[10\].

NOTE: If compressor uses CID field in compressed packet, the CID field
should be included in the feedback packet and the Code and CID should be
set as defined in \[8\].

### A.1.4 Feedback generation for test cases (R-mode only)

This subclause defines a mechanism by which the test equipment shall
dynamically generate feedback messages for each test case, once a
transition to R-mode has been initiated and for the entire R-mode
operation thereafter. Test cases may define additional feedback messages
as input to the compressor.

The test equipment shall generate a feedback message when the ROHC
packet type octet of the received compressed header matches any of the
values as described in the table A.1.4. The compressed header type can
be identified by inspecting the packet type octet of the compressed
header, i.e. the first octet of the ROHC base header \[8\].

Table A.1.4: Bitmasks for feedback generation

  -------------------------------------- --------------- ---------------
  Compressed Header Type (binary mask)   Packet Type     Outcome
  01xxxxxx                               R-0-CRC         Send feedback
  110xxxxx                               UOR-2\*         Send feedback
  1111110x                               IR              Send feedback
  11111000                               IR-DYN          Send feedback
  Other values                           Other packets   No feedback
  -------------------------------------- --------------- ---------------

where \'x\' means \'any value\'.

The feedback message shall be of the format as described in subclause
A.1.3 using:

\- Mode is set to 0x3 (means R-mode)

\- SN is set to the RTP SN corresponding to the received compressed
header.

The test equipment shall index the input sequence of uncompressed
headers using the RTP Sequence Number, and it shall associate the
correct RTP SN to each compressed header that it receives back from the
compressor. The test equipment can derive the RTP SN by counting the
number of received compressed headers.

NOTE: The purpose of this mechanism is only to provide feedback to the
compressor when operating in R-mode; it is not meant to make further
verifications of any specific ROHC functionality and applies only to the
test cases defined in this annex.

### A.1.5 Calculation of compressed header size

The following fields shall be excluded from the calculation of the size
of the compressed header in evaluation of compression performance:

\- ROHC CID/add-CID octet(s);

\- ROHC padding octets;

\- ROHC segmentation octets;

\- ROHC feedback octets, either piggybacked on the behalf of an
associated decompressor or as feedback packets interspersed within the
flow of compressed packets.

A.2 Test outline -- RoHC RTP Profile 0x0001 {#a.2-test-outline-rohc-rtp-profile-0x0001 .Style-Heading-2}
-------------------------------------------

RoHC compression shall start in U-mode, in accordance with RFC3095.
Transition to other compression modes shall be initiated by the test
equipment sending a feedback packet of type 2, indicating the desired
mode transition.

### A.2.1 Test 1a - Base test of ROHC RTP O-mode compressor

#### A.2.1.1 Test purpose

The purpose of the base test case is to verify that the compressor
properly implements compression for a well-behaved IP/UDP/RTP packet
flow, i.e. that it makes use of efficient compressed packet formats
available to ROHC RTP \[8\] when operating in O-mode.

#### A.2.1.2 Sequence details

A sequence consisting of 70 packets in total is used, where all header
fields are set according to the basic test packet structure, as
described in subclause A.3, with addition of the following:

> 1\. The RTP Sequence Number is a linearly increasing counter with a
> packet-to-packet delta of 1, set to 0x0000 for the first packet and
> thus ending with 0x0045 (69) in the last packet of the sequence
>
> 2\. The RTP Time Stamp is a linearly increasing counter with a
> packet-to-packet delta of 160, set to 0x00000000 for the first packet
> and thus ending with 0x00002B20 (11040) in the last packet of the
> sequence.
>
> 3\. The IP Identification is set to the same value as the RTP Sequence
> Number; this means that for IPv4 the IP-ID behaviour is not random,
> thus value(RND)=0 defined in \[8\] for both IPv4 and IPv6.

Between the 6th and 7th packets (SN=5 and SN=6) of the sequence, a
R^OH^C feed^ba^ck packet of feedback type 2 is to be given to the ROHC
compressor to trigger an immediate transition to O-mode operation. The
format of that packet is as follows:

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

+\-\--+\-\--+\-\--+\-\--+\-\--+\-\--+\-\--+\-\--+

\| 1 1 1 1et

+\-\--+\-\--+\-\--+\-\--+\-\--+\-\--+\-\--+\-\--+

\|Acktype\| Mode \| S+\-\--+\-\--+

\| SN \|

\| 0 0 0 1 \| 0 0 0 1 \|

+\-\--+ CRC \|

+\-\--+\-\--+\-\--+- set to 0x4 (indicates that feedback data abovpe is
set to 0x0 (means ACK)

\- Mode is set to 0x2 (means O-mode)

\- SN is set to 0x000

\- CRC is the 8-bit CRC computed over the entire feedback payload
including any CID fields but excluding the packet type, the \'Size\'
field and the \'Code\' octet, using the polynomial defined in \[8\],
\[10\].

NOTE: If compressor uses CID field in compressed packet, the CID field
should be included in the feedback packet and the Code and CID should be
set as defined in \[8\].

### A.2.2 Test 1b - Base test of ROHC RTP R-mode compressor

#### A.2.2.1 Test purpose

The purpose of the base test case is to verify that the compressor
properly implements compression for a well-behaved IP/UDP/RTP packet
flow, i.e. that it makes use of efficient compressed packet formats
available to ROHC RTP \[8\] when operating in R-mode.

#### A.2.2.2 Sequence details

A sequence consisting of 70 packets in total is used where all header
fields are set according to the basic test packet structure, as
described in subclause A.3, with addition of the following:

> 1\. The RTP Sequence Number is a linearly increasing counter with a
> packet-to-packet delta of 1, set to 0x0000 for the first packet and
> thus ending with 0x0045 (69) in the last packet of the sequence

> sequence.
>
> 3\. The IP Identification is set to the same value as the RTP Sequence
> Number; this means that for IPv4 the IP-ID behaviour is not random,
> thus value(RND)=0 defined in \[8\] for both IPv4 and IPv6.

Between the 6th and 7th (SN=5 and SN=6) packets of the sequence, the
first ROHC feedback packet of feedback type 2 is to b^e^ given ^to^ the
ROHC compressor to initiate transition to R-mode operation. The format
of that packet is as follows:

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

+\-\--+\-\--+\-\--+\-\--+\-\--+\-\--+\-\--+\-\--+

\| 1 1 1 1 0 \| Code \| feedback type octet

\| +\-\--+\-\--+\-\--+\-\--+\-\--+\-\--+\-\--+

\| 0 0 0 \-\--+\-\--+\-\--+\-\--+\-\--+

\| CRC \--+\-\--+\-\--+

Where:

\- Code is set to 0x4 (indipe octet is 4 octets)

\- Acktype is set to 0x0 ns R-mode)

\- SN is set to 0x000

\- CRC is the 8-bit CRC computed over the entire feedback payload
including any CID fields but excluding the packet type, the \'Size\'
field and the \'Code\' octet, using the polynomial defined in \[8\],
\[10\].

The test equipment waits for a UOR-2, IR-DYN or IR packet from the RoHC
compressor with the mode transition parameter set to R. The value of x
is the RTP SN of this received packet for which the test equipment
generates the second feedback packet of type 2, as described in
subclause A.1.4.

that it use efficient header formats available to ROHC RTP \[8\] when
operating in O-mode.

#### A.2.5.2 Sequence details

The test sequence is the same as in subclause A.2.1, with the following
exception:

### A.2.6 Test 3b - Re-establishment of TS function after DTX in R-mode

#### A.2.6.1 Test purpose

The purpose of the TS re-establish test case is to verify that the
compressor re-establishes the proper TS value after a DTX period, i.e.
that it use the efficient header formats available to ROHC RTP \[8\]
when operating in R-mode.

#### A.2.6.2 Sequence details

The test sequence is the same as in subclause A.2.2, with the following
exception:

> 1\. The RTP Time Stamp is a linearly increasing counter with a
> packet-to-packet delta of 160, set to 0x00000000 for the first packet.
>
> 2\. For packet with SN = 20, TS is increased to represent a 32 (0.64
> seconds) packet skip (32x160) and is thus set to (20+32)x160=8320
> (0x00002080). Then TS continues to grow as stated in 1 above.
>
> 3\. For packet with SN = 30, TS is increased to represent a 128 (2.56
> seconds) packet skip (128x160) and is thus set to
> (30+32+128)x160=30400 (0x000076C0). Then TS continues to grow as
> stated in 1 above.
>
> 4\. For packet with SN = 40, TS is increased to represent a 2048
> (40.96 seconds) packet skip (2048x160) and is thus set to
> (40+32+128+2048)x160=359680 (0x00057D00). Then TS continues to grow as
> stated in 1 above.
>
> 5\. TS thus ends at 393120 (0x0005FFA0) in the last packet of the

### A.2.13 Test 7a -- SRNS relocation in O-mode

#### A.2.13.1 Test purpose

This test applies to UEs supporting header compression context
relocation from Rel-5 onwards.

The purpose of this test case is to verify that the compressor does not
interrupt efficient header compression upon reception of the indication
about SRNS relocation being performed, i.e. that it makes use of
efficient compressed packet formats available to ROHC RTP \[8\] when
operating in O-mode when data transmission is resumed after SRNS
relocation.

Continuation of efficient header compression upon reception of the
indication about SRNS relocation being performed is possible according
to subclause 5.4.2, i.e. the compressor shall compress and transmit
uplink data as specified in \[8\] using the assumption that all ROHC
uplink packets transmitted are likely to be lost.

#### A.2.13.2 Sequence details

The test sequence is the same as in subclause A.2.1, with the following
exception:

Packets with SN = 10 to SN = 59 are removed from the sequence.

SRNS relocation occurs between packet with SN = 9 and packet with SN =
60, thus simulating a 1s long SRNS relocation that affects compression
of the IP/UDP/RTP packet flow.

NOTE: The operation of the ROHC compressor is not affected by the time
interval between packets with SN = 9 and SN = 60 (timer-based
compression is not allowed because no appropriate feedback is provided).

######## Annex B (informative): Reference model for generating ROHC performance requirements

B.1 Introduction
----------------

ROHC compressor and de-compressor may use a set of parameters in order
to operate (e.g. L confidence parameter, dynamic FOtimer and static
IRtimer, K1 out of N1, K2 out of N2...) that may be optimised for a
given application (e.g. Voice over IP, Videotelephony over IP,
Interactive Gaming over IP...).

NOTE: L confidence parameter allows setting the number of times an IR or
IR-Dyn packet is transmitted and FOtimer and IRtimer are used in order
to determine when a transition to a lower compressor state is necessary:
The dynamic timer FOtimer triggers SO state to FO state transition and
the static IRtimer triggers SO/FO state to IR state transition.

B.2 For Voice over IP (VoIP) optimisation
-----------------------------------------

### B.2.1 ROHC parameters optimisations for VoIP

For the support of VoIP in UTRAN, ROHC compressor and de-compressor
parameter values (L confidence parameter, dynamic FOtimer and static
IRtimer, K1 out of N1, K2 out of N2) may be used. Values used in ROHC
reference model are given in annex B.2.2 for O-mode.

\- The initialisation phase duration;

\- The reaction delay to decompression failure;

\- The header compression ratio (compressed header size / uncompressed
header size);

\- The error rates (in UDP and PDCP layers);

The amount of transferred data (including ROHC compressed packets and
feedbacks);

\- The resource usage (transport block occupancy in the RLC layer).

### B.2.2 Parameter setting for ROHC reference model for VoIP

The following parameters setting is applied in the reference model for
ROHC performance tests of VoIP application:

Table B.2.2: ROHC parameters setting for VoIP

  ---------------- -------------
