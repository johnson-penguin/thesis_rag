The present document specifies the model for the functional division
between the NAS and AS in a UE.

The present document applies to all UEs that support at least UTRA,
including multi-RAT UEs as described in 3GPP specifications, in the
following cases:

\- When the UE is camped on a UTRA cell;

\- When the UE is searching for a cell to camp on;

NOTE: The details for those cases are described in the specifications of
the other RAT.

The present document presents also examples of inter-layer procedures
related to the idle mode processes and describes idle mode functionality
of a multi-RAT UTRA/GSM/E-UTRA UE.

either manually or automatically.

**Serving cell:** The cell on which the UE is camped.

**Strongest cell:** The cell on a particular carrier that is considered
strongest according to the layer 1 cell search procedure \[14\]\[15\].
As the details of the layer 1 cell search are implementation dependent,
the precise definition of \'strongest cell\' is also implementation
dependent.

**Suitable Cell:** This is a cell on which an UE may camp. For a UTRA
cell, the criteria are defined in subclause 4.3, for a GSM cell the

4 General description of Idle mode
==================================

4.1 Overview
------------

When a UE is switched on, a public land mobile network (PLMN) is
selected and the UE searches for a suitable cell of this PLMN to camp
on. Criteria for cell selection and cell re-selection between radio
access technologies (RATs) described in this document only consider
radio criteria. In addition to RAT, the PLMN type may differ as well. In
this specification, the term PLMN is used as a generic term covering
both GSM MAP and ANSI-41 type of PLMNs. According to the type of PLMN,
the way to identify it can be different. If the PLMN type is GSM, the
PLMN is identified by \'PLMN identity\' and if the PLMN type is ANSI-41,
the PLMN is identified by \'SID\'

The NAS shall provide a list of equivalent PLMNs, if available, that the
AS shall use for cell selection and cell reselection.

The UE searches for a suitable cell of the selected PLMN and chooses
that cell to provide available services, and tunes to its control
channel. This choosing is known as \"camping on the cell\". The UE will,
if necessary, then register its presence, by means of a NAS registration
procedure, in the registration area of the chosen cell and as outcome of
a successful Location Registration the selected PLMN becomes the
registered PLMN \[5\].

If the UE finds a more suitable cell, it reselects onto that cell and
camps on it. If the new cell is in a different registration area,
location registration is performed.

If necessary, the UE shall search for higher priority PLMNs at regular
time intervals as described in \[9\] and search for a suitable cell if
another PLMN has been selected by NAS.

NOTE: For RRC connected mode the requirements for the search for higher
priority PLMNs are defined in \[4\].

Search of available CSGs may be triggered by NAS to support manual CSG
selection.

If the UE loses coverage of the registered PLMN, either a new PLMN is
selected automatically (automatic mode), or an indication of which PLMNs
are available is given to the user, so that a manual selection can be
made (manual mode).

Registration is not performed by UEs only capable of services that need
no registration.

The purpose of camping on a cell in idle mode is fourfold:

a\) It enables the UE to receive system information from the PLMN.

b\) When registered and if the UE wishes to establish an RRC connection,
it can do this by initially accessing the network on the control channel
of the cell on which it is camped.

c\) If the PLMN receives a call for the registered UE, it knows (in most
cases) the registration area of the cell in which the UE is camped. It
can then send a \"paging\" message for the UE on control channels of all
the cells in the registration area. The UE will then receive the paging
message because it is tuned to the control channel of a cell in that
registration area and the UE can respond on that control channel.

d\) It enables the UE to receive cell broadcast services.

If the UE is unable to find a suitable cell to camp on, or the USIM is
not inserted, or if the location registration failed (except for LR
rejected with cause \#12, cause \#14, cause \#15 or cause \#25, see
\[5\] and \[16\]), it attempts to camp on a cell irrespective of the
PLMN identity, and enters a \"limited service\" state in which it can
only attempt to make emergency calls, receive ETWS, and receive CMAS.

The idle mode tasks can be subdivided into four processes:

\- PLMN selection;

\- Cell selection and reselection;

\- Location registration;

> \- Support for manual CSG selection.

The relationship between these processes is illustrated in Figure 1.

Figure 1: Overall Idle Mode process

When NAS indicates that PSM starts, the AS configuration (e.g.
priorities provided by dedicated signalling and logged measurements) is
kept, all running timers continue to run but the UE need not perform any
idle mode tasks. If a timer expires while the UE is in PSM it is up to
UE implementation whether it performs the corresponding action
immediately or the latest when PSM ends. When NAS indicates that PSM
ends, the UE shall perform all idle mode tasks.

When NAS indicates that extended DRX in Idle mode parameters have been
received, the AS configuration (e.g. priorities provided by dedicated
signalling and logged measurements) is kept, all running timers continue
to run but the UE need not perform any idle mode tasks. When NAS
indicates that extended DRX in Idle mode parameters have been received,
the AS starts a timer to indicate the start of the paging transmission
window.If a timer expires while the UE is in extended DRX it is up to UE
implementation whether it performs the corresponding action immediately
or the latest when the paging transmission window starts. When the timer
of the extended DRX expires, the AS re-starts the timer of the extended
DRX, the AS starts a timer to indicate the end of the paging
transmission window, and the UE shall perform all idle mode tasks until
the timer of the paging transmission window expires.

4.2 Functional division between AS and NAS in Idle mode
-------------------------------------------------------

Table 1 presents the functional division between UE non-access stratum
(NAS) and UE access stratum (AS) in idle mode. The NAS part is specified
in \[5\] and the AS part in the present document. Examples of different
idle mode procedures are presented in Clause 10.

+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+

4.3 Service type in Idle and Connected Mode
-------------------------------------------

This clause defines the level of service that may be provided by the
network to a UE in Idle mode and Connected Mode.

The action of camping on a cell is necessary to get access to some
services. Three levels of services are defined for UE:

\- Limited service (emergency calls, ETWS if supported, and CMAS if
supported on an acceptable cell)

\- Normal service (for public use on a suitable cell)

\- Operator service (for operators only on a reserved cell)

Furthermore, the cells are categorised according to which services they
offer:

[acceptable cell:]{.underline}

An \"acceptable cell\" is a cell on which the UE may camp to obtain
limited service (originate emergency calls, receive ETWS if supported,
and receive CMAS if supported). Such a cell shall fulfil the following
requirements, which is the minimum set of requirements to initiate an
emergency call and to receive ETWS primary notification and ETWS
secondary notification and to receive CMAS notification in a UTRAN
network:

\- The cell is not barred, see subclause 5.3.1.1;

\- The cell selection criteria are fulfilled, see subclause 5.2.3.1.2;

[suitable cell:]{.underline}

A \"suitable cell\" is a cell on which the UE may camp on to obtain
normal service. Such a cell shall fulfil all the following requirements.

\- The cell shall be part of either:

\- the selected PLMN, or:

\- the registered PLMN, or:

\- a PLMN of the Equivalent PLMN list

\- For a CSG cell, the cell is a CSG member cell for the UE;

> According to the latest information provided by the NAS.

\- The cell is not barred, see subclause 5.3.1.1;

\- The cell is part of at least one LA that is not part of the list of
\"forbidden LAs for roaming\" \[9\], which belongs to a PLMN that
fulfills the first bullet above;

\- The cell selection criteria are fulfilled, see subclause 5.2.3.1.2.

If the IE \"Multiple PLMN List\" \[4\] is broadcast in the cell, the
cell is considered to be part of all LAs with LAIs constructed from the
PLMN identities in the \"Multiple PLMN List\" and the LAC broadcast in
the cell.

[barred cell:]{.underline}

A cell is barred if it is so indicated in the system information \[4\].

[reserved cell:]{.underline}

A cell is reserved if it is so indicated in system information \[4\].

Following exceptions to these definitions are applicable for UEs:

\- camped on a cell that belongs to a LA that is forbidden for regional
provision of service, and during emergency calls.

\- as an outcome of the manual CSG selection procedure the UE is allowed
to access an acceptable cell which fulfils the cell selection criteria
and is not barred or reserved for operator use for UEs not belonging to
AC 11 or 15 and inform NAS that access is possible (for location
registration procedure).

NOTE: UE is not required to support manual search and selection of
CSG(s) while in RRC CONNECTED state.

A cell that belongs to a LA that is forbidden for regional provision
service (\[5\], \[16\]) is suitable but provides only limited service.

If a UE has an ongoing emergency call, all acceptable cells of that PLMN
are treated as suitable for cell reselection for the duration of the
emergency call.

[suitable MBSFN cluster:]{.underline}

A cell is part of an MBSFN cluster if it is indicated in system
information \[4\]. An MBSFN cluster provides exclusively MBMS services.
A [suitable MBSFN cluster]{.underline} shall fulfil all the following
requirements:

\- For FDD, 3.84 Mcps TDD IMB and 3.84/7.68 Mcps TDD the [MBSFN
cluster]{.underline} shall be part of either:

\- the registered PLMN, or:

\- a PLMN of the Equivalent PLMN list

The MBSFN cluster shall be indicated as:

\- providing MBSFN only service

For FDD, 3.84 Mcps TDD IMB and 3.84/7.68 Mcps TDD MBSFN cluster
selection/reselection process for MBSFN clusters operating on the same
frequency shall be based on reception quality. Details of the process
are not specified.

5 Process and procedure descriptions
====================================

5.1 PLMN selection
------------------

### 5.1.1 General

In the UE, the AS shall report available PLMNs to the NAS on request
from the NAS or autonomously.

UE shall maintain a list of allowed PLMN types. The allowed PLMN type
can be GSM-MAP only, ANSI-41 only or both. During PLMN selection, based
on the list of allowed PLMN types and a list of PLMN identities in
priority order, the particular PLMN may be selected either automatically
or manually. Each PLMN in the list of PLMN identities can be identified
by either \'PLMN identity\' (GSM-MAP) or \'SID\'. In the system
information on the broadcast channel, the UE can receive a \'PLMN
identity\' (GSM-MAP) or a \'SID\' or a \'PLMN identity\' (GSM-MAP) and a
\'SID\', in a given cell. For a given cell, the UE might receive several
\'PLMN identities\' from the system information on the broadcast
channel. The result of the PLMN selection is an identifier of the
selected PLMN, the choice being based on the allowed PLMN types, UE
capability or other factors. This identifier is one of either \'PLMN
identity\' for GSM-MAP type of PLMNs or \'SID\' for ANSI-41 type of
PLMNs.

In case that the list of allowed PLMN types includes GSM-MAP, the
non-access part of the PLMN selection process is specified in \[5\]. In
the case that list of allowed PLMN types includes ANSI-41, the
non-access stratum part of the PLMN selection is specified in
TIA/EIA/IS-2000.5 and TIA/EIA/IS-707.

### 5.1.2 Support for PLMN Selection

#### 5.1.2.1 General

On request of the NAS the AS should perform a search for available PLMNs
and report them to NAS.

#### 5.1.2.2 UTRA case

The UE shall scan all RF channels in the UTRA bands according to its
capabilities to find available PLMNs. On each carrier, the UE shall
search for the strongest cell and read its system information, in order
to find out which PLMN the cell belongs to. If the UE can read one or
several PLMN identities in the strongest cell, each found PLMN (see the
PLMN reading in \[4\]) shall be reported to the NAS as a high quality
PLMN (but without the RSCP value), provided that the following high
quality criterion is fulfilled:

1\. For an FDD cell, the measured primary CPICH RSCP value shall be
greater than or equal to -95 dBm.

2\. For a TDD cell, the measured P-CCPCH RSCP shall be greater than or
equal to -84 dBm.

Found PLMNs that do not satisfy the high quality criterion, but for
which the UE has been able to read the PLMN identities are reported to
the NAS together with the CPICH RSCP value for UTRA FDD cells and
P-CCPCH RSCP for UTRA TDD cells. The quality measure reported by the UE
to NAS shall be the same for each PLMN found in one cell.

The search for PLMNs on the rest of the carriers may be stopped on
request of the NAS. The UE may optimise this search by using stored
information of carrier frequencies and optionally also information on
cell parameters, e.g. scrambling codes, from previously received
measurement control information elements.

Once the UE has selected a PLMN, the cell selection procedure shall be
performed in order to select a suitable cell of that PLMN to camp on.

If a CSG ID is provided by NAS as part of PLMN selection, the UE shall
search for an acceptable or suitable cell belonging to the provided CSG
ID to camp on. When the UE is no longer camped on a cell with the
provided CSG ID, AS shall inform NAS.

#### 5.1.2.3 GSM case

Support for network selection in GSM is described in \[1\].

#### 5.1.2.4 E-UTRA case

Support for network selection in E-UTRA is described in \[18\].

5.2 Cell selection and reselection in idle mode
-----------------------------------------------

### 5.2.1 Introduction

As stated in clause 1, the present document applies to UEs that support
at least UTRA.

Different types of measurements are used in different RATs and modes for
the cell selection and reselection. The performance requirements for the
measurements are specified in \[10\] and \[11\].

The NAS can control the RAT(s) in which the cell selection should be
performed, for instance by indicating RAT(s) associated with the
selected PLMN, and by maintaining a list of forbidden registration
area(s) and a list of equivalent PLMNs. The UE shall select a suitable
cell and the radio access mode based on idle mode measurements and cell
selection criteria.

In order to speed up the cell selection process, stored information for
several RATs may be available in the UE.

When camped on a cell, the UE shall regularly search for a better cell
according to the cell reselection criteria. If a better cell is found,
that cell is selected. The change of cell may imply a change of RAT.
Details on performance requirements for cell reselection can be found in
\[10\] and \[11\].

The NAS is informed if the cell selection and reselection results in
changes in the received system information.

For normal service, the UE has to camp on a suitable cell, tune to that
cell\'s control channel(s) so that the UE can:

\- Receive system information from the PLMN;

\- Receive registration area information from the PLMN, e.g., location
area and routing area; and

\- Receive other AS and NAS Information;

\- If registered:

\- receive paging and notification messages from the PLMN; and

\- initiate call setup for outgoing calls or other actions from the UE.

### 5.2.2 States and state transitions in Idle Mode

Figure 2 shows the states and procedures in Idle Mode.

Figure 2: Idle Mode Cell Selection and Reselection\
In any state, a new PLMN selection causes an exit to number 1

#### 5.2.2.1 Cell Selection process overview

Whenever a PLMN has been selected by NAS, the UE shall attempt to find a
suitable cell to camp on.

The NAS may control the cell selection by:

\- providing information on RAT(s) associated with the selected PLMN;

\- maintaining lists of forbidden registration areas;

\- providing a list of equivalent PLMNs;

One or several RATs may be associated with the selected PLMN. In \[5\]
it is specified which RAT a UE shall select to search for a suitable
cell of the selected PLMN.

The AS shall attempt to find a suitable cell to camp on as specified in
clause 5.2.3.

When the MBMS frequency layer dispersion is triggered, the UE actions
are specified in \[4\].

If a suitable cell is found, the UE shall select this cell to camp on,
and report this event to NAS so that the necessary NAS registration
procedures can be performed. When the registration is successful, the UE
enters in state *Camped normally* in order to obtain normal service.

If the UE is unable to find any suitable cell of selected PLMN the UE
shall enter the *Any cell selection* state.

#### 5.2.2.2 Camped normally state overview

In this state, the UE obtains normal service and performs the tasks
specified in 5.2.5.

If after a *Cell reselection evaluation process* a better cell is found,
the *Cell reselection procedure* is performed. If no suitable cell is
found, the UE shall enter the state *Any cell selection*.

If a necessary NAS registration is rejected, the UE shall enter the *Any
cell selection* state, except if the LR is rejected with cause \#12,
cause \#14, cause \#15 or cause \#25. In this case the UE shall behave
as specified in \[5\] and \[16\].

When UE leaves idle mode in order to enter the state *Connected mode*,
the UE shall attempt to access the current serving cell. If the access
attempt to the serving cell fails, the UE shall use the *Cell
reselection* *evaluation* procedure.

#### 5.2.2.3 Connected mode State overview

The procedures in *Connected mode* state are specified in \[4\]

When returning to idle mode, the UE shall use the procedure *Cell
selection when leaving connected mode* in order to find a suitable cell
to camp on and enter state *Camped normally*. If a suitable cell is
found, then the AS reports this event to NAS to be capable to perform
necessary NAS registration procedures. If no suitable cell is found, the
*Stored information cell selection* procedure shall be used.

If no suitable cell is found in *cell reselection* *evaluation* process,
the UE enters the state *Any cell selection*.

#### 5.2.2.4 Any cell selection State overview

In this state the UE performs the tasks specified in subclause 5.2.8

The state *Any cell selection* is also entered if the NAS indicates that
a location registration is rejected except if the LR is rejected with
cause \#12, cause \#14, cause \#15 or cause \#25, see \[5\] and \[16\],
or if there is no USIM in the UE.

If the UE received an LR reject with cause \#12, cause \#14, cause \#15
or cause \#25, the UE shall behave as specified in \[5\] and \[16\].

If an acceptable cell is found, the UE shall inform the NAS and camp on
this cell and obtain limited service, state *Camped on any cell*. The
subsequent actions of the NAS regarding the PLMN selection are specified
in \[5\].

#### 5.2.2.5 Camped on any cell State overview

In this state the UE obtains limited service and shall behave as
specified in subclause 5.2.9. In this state if the UE supports CS voice
services, the UE shall avoid reselecting an acceptable cell of E-UTRA
regardless of priorities provided in system information of current cell.
The UE shall regularly attempt to find a suitable cell, trying all RATs
that are supported by the UE. If a suitable cell is found, this causes
an exit to number 2 in figure 2.

NOTE: The \'PLMN selection\' process may select a new PLMN at any time
in idle mode, which in Figure 2 causes an exit to number 1.

### 5.2.3 Cell Selection Process

#### 5.2.3.1 UTRA case

##### 5.2.3.1.1 Description

The UE shall use one of the following two search procedures:

a\) Initial Cell Selection

This procedure requires no prior knowledge of which RF channels are UTRA
carriers. The UE shall scan all RF channels in the UTRA bands according
to its capabilities to find a suitable cell. On each carrier, the UE
need only search for the strongest cell. Once a suitable cell is found
this cell shall be selected.

b\) Stored Information Cell Selection

This procedure requires stored information of carrier frequencies and
optionally also information on cell parameters, e.g. scrambling codes,
from previously received measurement control information elements. Once
the UE has found a suitable cell the UE shall select it. If no suitable
cell is found the Initial cell selection procedure shall be started.

##### 5.2.3.1.2 Criteria

The cell selection criterion S is fulfilled when:

Where:

Where:

the signalled values QqualminOffset and QrxlevminOffset are only applied
when a cell is evaluated for cell selection as a result of a periodic
search for a higher priority PLMN while camped normally in a VPLMN
\[5\]. During this periodic search for higher priority PLMN the UE may
check the S criteria of a cell using parameter values stored from a
different cell of this higher priority PLMN.

\- perform necessary measurements for the cell reselection evaluation
procedure;

\- execute the cell reselection evaluation process on the following
occasions/triggers:

1\) UE internal triggers, so as to meet performance as specified in

##### 5.2.6.1.0 Use of MBMS PL

In the cell reselection process, an MBMS PL shall only be applicable
while the UE is receiving an MBMS session from one or more of the
ongoing activated MBMS services for which this PL is indicated.

##### 5.2.6.1.1 Measurement rules for cell re-selection when HCS is not used

The measurement rules below apply in Idle, URA\_PCH, CELL\_PCH states.
For FDD, 3.84 Mcps TDD and 7.68 Mcps TDD, in CELL\_FACH state the
measurement rules below apply only if HS-DSCH discontinuous reception,
with or without second DRX cycle, is configured, as specified in \[4\]
and according to the requirements specified in \[10\]. Otherwise, the UE
is required to perform measurements on all intra-frequency,
inter-frequency and inter-RAT cells listed in system information
according to requirements specified in \[10\]. For 1.28 Mcps TDD, in
CELL\_FACH state the UE is required to perform measurements on all
intra-frequency, inter-frequency and inter-RAT cells listed in system
information according to requirements specified in \[11\]. In Idle,
URA\_PCH, CELL\_PCH and CELL\_FACH states the UE shall only consider
those cells the UE is mandated to measure according to the measurement
rules below as measured cells in the cell reselection criteria
(subclause 5.2.6.1.4).

If the system information broadcast in the serving cell indicates that
HCS is not used, then for intra-frequency and inter-frequency
measurements and inter-RAT measurements, the UE shall:

\- use Squal for FDD cells and Srxlev for TDD for Sx, and apply the
following rules.

1\. If Sx \> S~intrasearch~, UE may choose to not perform
intra-frequency measurements.\
If Sx \<= S~intrasearch,~ perform intra-frequency measurements.\
If S~intrasearch,~ is not sent for serving cell, perform intra-frequency
measurements.

If the system information broadcast in the serving cell indicates that
HCS is not used and absolute priorities for inter-frequency layers are
not provided, then for inter-frequency measurements the UE shall:

2\. If Sx \> S~intersearch~ and MBMS PL has not been indicated, and
Srxlev \> S~searchHCS~ if S~searchHCS~ is signalled, UE may choose to
not perform inter-frequency measurements.\
If Sx \> S~intersearch~and MBMS PL has been indicated and the serving
cell belongs to the MBMS PL, and Srxlev \> S~searchHCS~ if S~searchHCS~
is signalled, UE may choose to not perform inter-frequency
measurements.\
If Sx \> S~intersearch~, and MBMS PL has been indicated and the serving
cell does not belong to the MBMS PL, and Srxlev \> S~searchHCS~ if
S~searchHCS~ is signalled, UE shall at least perform inter-frequency
measurements on the MBMS PL.\
If Sx \<= S~intersearch~, or Srxlev \<= S~searchHCS~ if S~searchHCS~ is
signalled, perform inter-frequency measurements.\
If S~intersearch~, is not sent for serving cell, perform inter-frequency
measurements.\
If Dedicated CSG frequencies have been indicated by system information
the UE may choose not to perform inter-frequency measurments of these
frequencies.

If the system information broadcast in the serving cell indicates that
HCS is not used and absolute priorities for some inter-RAT layers are
not provided, then for inter-RAT measurements on RATs for which absolute
priority information is not provided the UE shall:

3\. If Sx \> Ssearch~RAT\ m~, and Srxlev \> S~HCS,RATm~ if S~HCS,RATm~
is signalled, UE may choose to not perform measurements on cells of RAT
\"m\".\
If Sx \<= Ssearch~RAT\ m~, or Srxlev \<= S~HCS,RATm~ if S~HCS,RATm~ is
signalled, perform measurements on cells of RAT \"m\".\
If Ssearch~RAT\ m~, is not sent for serving cell, perform measurements
on cells of RAT \"m\".

If HCS is not used and if S~limit,SearchRATm~ is sent for serving cell,
UE shall ignore it.

NOTE: The presence of S~searchHCS~ and S~HCS,RATm~ thresholds in system
information are used to avoid introducing new parameters to system
information and their presence does not imply that HCS is used.

##### 5.2.6.1.1a High-mobility state when HCS is not used

High-mobility state, as applied in HCS case, is also applicable in
non-HCS if the parameters non-HCS\_ T~CRmax~, non-HCS\_N~CR~ and
non-HCS\_T~CRmaxhyst~ are sent on the system information broadcast.

If in non-HCS environment the number of cell reselections during time
period non-HCS\_T~CRmax~ exceeds non-HCS\_N~CR~, or if the network (via
RRC signalling) has ordered the UE to consider itself to be in
high-mobility state, then high-mobility state has been detected.

When the number of cell reselections during time period
non-HCS\_T~CRmax~ no longer exceeds non-HCS\_N~CR~, the UE shall:

\- continue in high-mobility state.

\- if the criteria for entering high-mobility state is not detected
during time period non-HCS-T~CrmaxHyst~:

\- exit high-mobility state.

If the UE is in non-HCS environment and in high-mobility state, the UE
shall apply the speed dependent scaling rules as defined in subclause
5.2.6.1.4.

##### 5.2.6.1.2 Measurement rules for cell re-selection when HCS is used

The measurement rules below apply in Idle, URA\_PCH, CELL\_PCH states.
For FDD, 3.84 Mcps TDD and 7.68 Mcps TDD, in CELL\_FACH state the
measurement rules below apply only if HS-DSCH discontinuous reception,
with or without second DRX cycle, is configured, as specified in \[4\]
and according to the requirements specified in \[10\]. Otherwise, the UE
is required to perform measurements on all intra-frequency,
inter-frequency and inter-RAT cells listed in system information
according to requirements specified in \[10\]. For 1.28 Mcps TDD, in
CELL\_FACH state the UE is required to perform measurements on all
intra-frequency, inter-frequency and inter-RAT cells listed in system
information according to requirements specified in \[11\]. In Idle,
URA\_PCH, CELL\_PCH and CELL\_FACH states the UE shall only consider
those cells the UE is mandated to measure according to the measurement
rules below as measured cells in the cell reselection criteria
(subclause 5.2.6.1.4).

The UE shall not use HCS for inter-frequency reselection if absolute
priority based cell reselection (see subclause 5.2.6.1.4a) is used for
inter-frequency reselection. The UE shall not use HCS for inter-RAT
reselection if absolute priority based cell reselection (see subclause
5.2.6.1.4a) is used for that RAT.

Use Squal for FDD cells and Srxlev for TDD cells for Sx and apply the
following rules.

If the system information broadcast in the serving cell indicates that
HCS is used, then for intra-frequency and inter-frequency measurements,
the UE shall:

use HCS priority~1~ as the HCS priority broadcast in the system
information and apply the following rule:

IF an MBMS PL is used THEN

\- If the UE is not in high-mobility state, for serving cell and
neighbour cells belonging to the MBMS PL set the HCS priority = HCS
priority~1~ + HCS\_OFF~mbms~.

\- If the UE is in high-mobility state, for serving cell and neighbour
cells belonging to the MBMS PL set the HCS priority = HCS priority~1~.

\- for serving cell and neighbour cells not belonging to the MBMS PL,
set the HCS priority = HCS priority~1.~

IF an MBMS PL is not used THEN

For serving cell and all neighbour cells set HCS priority = HCS
priority~1~

Then apply this to the following:

1\. For intra-frequency and inter-frequency measurement rules for UEs
not in high-mobility state

IF (Srxlev~s~ \<= Ssearch~HCS~) or (if FDD and S~x~ \<= S~intersearch~)
THEN

measure on all intra-frequency and inter-frequency cells.

ELSE

IF (S~x~ \> S~intrasearch~) THEN

measure on all intra-frequency and inter-frequency cells, which have
higher HCS priority level than the serving cell

measure on all intra-frequency and inter-frequency cells, which have
equal or higher HCS priority level than the serving cell

measure on all intra-frequency cells. UEs in high-mobility state may
also use this rule.

> high-mobility state are triggered.

ENDIF

ENDIF

If HCS is used and if S~searchHCS~ or S~intersearch~ (in FDD) are not
sent for the serving cell, UE shall:

measure on all intra-frequency and inter-frequency cells.

2\. For intra-frequency and inter-frequency measurement rules for UE\'s
in high-mobility state:

If the number of cell reselections during time period T~CRmax~ exceeds
N~CR~, or if the network (via RRC signalling) has ordered the UE to
consider itself in high-mobility state, then high-mobility state has
been detected. In this high-mobility state, the UE shall

IF (Srxlev~s~ \<= Ssearch~HCS~) or (if FDD and S~x~ \<= S~intersearch~),
or S~searchHCS~ or S~intersearch~ (in FDD) are not sent for the serving
cell THEN

measure on all intra-frequency and inter-frequency cells.

ELSE

measure intra-frequency and inter-frequency neighbouring cells, which
have equal or lower HCS priority than serving cell.

ENDIF

When the number of cell reselections during time period T~CRmax~ no
longer exceeds N~CR~, UE shall

\- continue these measurements during time period T~CrmaxHyst~

\- if the criteria for entering high-mobility state is not detected
during time period T~CrmaxHyst~:

\- exit high-mobility state.

If Dedicated CSG frequencies have been indicated by System Information
the UE may choose not to perform inter-frequency measurements of these
frequencies.

When serving cell belongs to a hierarchical cell structure, the UE shall
follow these rules for Inter-RAT measurements:

1\. Inter-RAT threshold-based measurement rules for UEs not in
high-mobility state

IF (Srxlev~s~ \<= S~HCS,RATm~) or (if FDD and S~x~ \<= S~SearchRATm~)
THEN

UE shall measure on all inter-RATm cells.

ELSE

IF (S~x~ \> S~limit,SearchRATm~) THEN

UE may choose to not measure neighbouring cells in RAT \"m\".

ELSE

UE shall measure on all neighbouring cells in RAT \"m\", which have
equal or higher HCS priority level than the serving cell

ENDIF

ENDIF

If HCS is used and if S~HCS,RATm~ is not sent for the serving cell, UE
shall measure on all inter-RATm cells.

2\. Inter-RAT measurement rules for UEs in high-mobility state

\- If the number of cell reselections during time period T~CRmax~
exceeds N~CR~, or if the network (via RRC signalling) has ordered the UE
to consider itself in high-mobility state, then high-mobility state has
been detected. In this high-mobility state, the UE shall

\- IF (Srxlev~s~ \<= S~HCS,RATm~) or (if FDD and S~x~ \<=
S~SearchRATm~), or S~HCS,RATm~ or S~SearchRATm~ are not sent for the
serving cell THEN

> \- UE shall measure on all inter-RATm cells.

ELSE

\- measure the neighbouring cells in RAT \"m\", which have an equal or
lower HCS priority than the serving cell

\- ENDIF

When the number of cell reselections during time interval T~CRmax~ no
longer exceeds N~CR~, UE shall

\- continue these measurements during time period T~CrmaxHyst~

\- if the criteria for entering high-mobility state is not detected
during time period T~CrmaxHyst~

\- exit high-mobility state.

##### 5.2.6.1.2a Measurement rules for inter-frequency and inter-RAT cell reselection when absolute priorities are used

The measurement rules below apply in Idle, URA\_PCH, CELL\_PCH states.
In CELL\_FACH state, if (High Priority Layers is indicated in CELL\_FACH
Absolute Priority Measurement Indicator \[4\] and SrxlevServingCell \>
Sprioritysearch1 and SqualServingCell \> Sprioritysearch2) or (All
Layers is indicated in CELL\_FACH Absolute Priority Measurement
Indicator \[4\]) then the measurement rules below apply, otherwise the
measurement rules in 5.2.6.1.1 and 5.2.6.1.2 apply.

The UE is required to perform measurements of inter-frequency and
inter-RAT cells listed in system information according to Measurement
requirements are specified in \[10\]. UE specific priorities are not
applied in camped on any cell state.

If the UE has received absolute priority information for inter-frequency
layers, the UE shall follow these rules:

\- The UE shall perform measurements of inter-frequency layers with a
priority higher than the priority of the current serving layer.

NOTE: The rate of these measurements may vary depending on whether
Srxlev and Squal of the serving cell are above or below
S~prioritysearch1~ and S~prioritysearch2~. This is specified in \[10\].

\- When the UE in *camped normally* state, has only dedicated priorities
other than for the current frequency, the UE shall consider the current
frequency to be the lowest priority frequency (i.e. lower than any of
network configured values).

\- For inter-frequency layers with a priority equal or lower than the
priority of the current serving layer:

\- If Srxlev**~ServingCell~** \> S~prioritysearch1~ and
Squal**~ServingCell~** \> S~prioritysearch2~ the UE may choose not to
perform measurements of inter-frequency layers of equal or lower
priority.

\- If Srxlev**~ServingCell~** \<= S~prioritysearch1~ or
Squal**~ServingCell~** \<= S~prioritysearch2~ the UE shall perform
measurements of inter-frequency layers of equal or lower priority.

\- The UE may choose not to perform measurements of inter-frequency
layers for which the UE has no absolute priority.

If the UE has received absolute priority information for inter-RAT
layers, the UE shall follow these rules:

\- The UE shall perform measurements of inter-RAT layers with a priority
higher than the priority of the current serving cell.

NOTE: The rate of these measurements may vary depending on whether
Srxlev and Squal of the serving cell are above or below
S~prioritysearch1~ and S~prioritysearch2~. This is specified in \[10\].

\- For inter-RAT layers with a priority lower than the priority of the
current serving cell:

\- If Srxlev**~ServingCell~** \> S~prioritysearch1~ and
Squal**~ServingCell~** \> S~prioritysearch2~ the UE may choose not to
perform measurements of inter-RAT layers of lower priority.

\- If Srxlev**~ServingCell~** \<= S~prioritysearch1~ or
Squal**~ServingCell~** \<= S~prioritysearch2~ the UE shall perform
measurements of inter-RAT layers of lower priority.

> \- If absolute priority information is provided for any inter-RAT
> layers in a RAT, the UE may choose not to perform measurements on
> layers in that RAT for which the UE has no absolute priority.

\- The UE shall perform measurements according to subclause 5.2.6.1.1
for inter-RAT layers for which the UE has no absolute priority. For all
inter-RAT layers belonging to one RAT, either the rules above or the
rules in subclause 5.2.6.1.1 or 5.2.6.1.2 shall apply.

\- In CELL\_FACH state: If there are UTRAN inter-frequency, GERAN and
E-UTRAN neighbours configured and required to be measured according to
the measurement rules above, then the UE shall perform measurements on
UTRAN inter-frequency and E-UTRAN layers (i.e. the UE is not required to
measure GERAN, regardless of whether GERAN has absolute priorities
assigned).

##### 5.2.6.1.3 Highest ranked cells with cell reservations, access restrictions or unsuitable for normal camping

For the highest ranked cell (including serving cell) according to cell
reselection criteria specified in subclause 5.2.6.1.4, or for the best
cell according to absolute priority reselection criteria specified in
subclause 5.2.6.1.4a, the UE shall check if the access is restricted
according to the rules in subclause 5.3.1.1.

If that cell and other cells have to be excluded from the candidate
list, as stated in subclause 5.3.1.1, the UE shall not consider these as
candidates for cell reselection. This limitation is removed when the
highest ranked cell changes.

If the highest ranked cell or best cell according to absolute priority
reselection rules is an intra-frequency or inter-frequency cell which is
not suitable due to being part of the \"list of forbidden LAs for
roaming\" or belonging to a PLMN which is not indicated as being
equivalent to the registered PLMN, the UE shall not consider this cell
and other cells on the same frequency, as candidates for reselection for
a maximum of 300s. If the UE has to perform an *any cell selection*
procedure any limitation shall be removed. If the UE is redirected under
UTRAN control to a frequency for which the timer is running, any
limitation on that frequency shall be removed.

If the highest ranked cell or best cell according to absolute priority
reselection rules is an inter-RAT cell which is not suitable due to
being part of the \"list of forbidden LAs for roaming\" or belonging to
a PLMN which is not indicated as being equivalent to the registered
PLMN, the UE shall not consider this cell and other cells on the same
frequency as candidates for reselection for a maximum of 300s. If the UE
has to perform an *any cell selection* procedure any limitation shall be
removed. If the UE is redirected under UTRAN control to a frequency for
which the timer is running, any limitation on that frequency shall be
removed.

##### 5.2.6.1.4 Cell Reselection Criteria

The following cell re-selection criteria are used for intra-frequency
cells, inter-frequency cells if no absolute priority information for any
inter-frequency layer is available to the UE, and inter-RAT cells if no
absolute priority information for any inter-RAT layer is available to
the UE for that RAT. For inter-frequency and inter-RAT layers in a RAT
for which absolute priorities are defined, then the cell reselection
criteria in subclause 5.2.6.1.4a shall apply.

The quality level threshold criterion H for hierarchical cell structures
is used to determine whether prioritised ranking according to
hierarchical cell re-selection rules shall apply, and is defined by:

If it is indicated in system information that HCS is not used, the
quality level threshold criterion H is not applied.

The cell-ranking criterion R is defined by:

where:

\- the signalled value Qoffmbms is only applied to those cells (serving
or neighbouring) belonging to the MBMS PL

\- for a CSG cell not included in the neighbour cell list, then
Qoffsets,n and Qoffmbms have the value 0.

where:

TEMP\_OFFSET~n~ applies an offset to the H and R criteria for the
duration of PENALTY\_TIME~n~ after a timer T~n~ has started for that
neighbouring cell.

TEMP\_OFFSET~n~ and PENALTY\_TIME~n~ are only applicable if the usage of
HCS is indicated in system information.

For a CSG cell not included in the neighbour cell list, then
TEMP\_OFFSET~n~ has the value of 0.

The timer T~n~ is implemented for each neighbouring cell. T~n~ shall be
started from zero when one of the following conditions becomes true:

\- if HCS\_PRIO~n~ \<\> HCS\_PRIO~s~ and

Q~meas~,~n~ \>= Qhcs~n~

Or

\- if HCS\_PRIO~n~ = HCS\_PRIO~s~ and

\- for serving FDD and neighbour FDD cells if the quality measure for
cell selection and reselection is set to CPICH RSCP in the serving cell,
and:

Q~meas,n~ \> Q~meas~,~s~ + Qoffset1~s,n~

\- for serving FDD and neighbour FDD cells if the quality measure for
cell selection and reselection is set to CPICH Ec/No in the serving
cell, and:

Q~meas,n~ \> Q~meas~,~s~ + Qoffset2~s,n~

\- for all other serving and neighbour cells:

Q~meas,n~ \> Q~meas~,~s~ + Qoffset1~s,n~

T~n~ for the associated neighbour cell shall be stopped as soon as any
of the above conditions are no longer fulfilled. Any value calculated
for TO~n~ is valid only if the associated timer T~n~ is still running
else TO~n~ shall be set to zero.

At cell-reselection, a timer T~n~ is stopped only if the corresponding
cell is not a neighbour cell of the new serving cell, or if the criteria
given above for starting timer T~n~ for the corresponding cell is no
longer fulfilled with the parameters of the new serving cell. On cell
re-selection, timer T~n~ shall be continued to be run for the
corresponding cells but the criteria given above shall be evaluated with
parameters broadcast in the new serving cell if the corresponding cells
are neighbours of the new serving cell.

For a CSG cell not included in the neighbour cell list, the cell
specific parameter values to be used shall be the same as the serving
cell.

If HCS is not used in the serving cell the UE shall perform ranking of
all cells that fulfil the criterion S, among:

\- all measured cells (see subclause 5.2.6.1.1).

If HCS is used in the serving cell, then from the cells that fulfil the
criterion S, the UE shall perform ranking of all cells among

1\. when not in high-mobility state (see subclause 5.2.6.1.2),

> \- all measured cells, that have the highest HCS\_PRIO among those
> cells that fulfil the criterion H \>= 0.
>
> \- all measured cells, not considering HCS priority levels, if no cell
> fulfil the criterion H \>= 0.

2 when in high-mobility state (see subclause 5.2.6.1.2),

\- all measured cells, and among these cells:

\- if there are cells with a lower HCS priority than the serving cell
that fulfil the criterion H \>= 0:

\- from the cells that have a lower HCS priority than the serving cell,
all cells that have the highest HCS\_PRIO among those cells that fulfil
the criterion H \>=0;

\- else:

\- if there are cells that fulfil the criterion H \>= 0 with an HCS
priority higher or equal to the HCS priority of the serving cell:

\- from the cells that have an HCS priority higher or equal to the HCS
priority of the serving cell, all cells that have the lowest HCS\_PRIO
among those cells that fulfil the criterion H \>=0;

\- else

\- all cells not considering HCS priority levels.

The cells shall be ranked according to the R criteria specified above,
deriving Q~meas,n~ and Q~meas,s~ and calculating the R values using
CPICH RSCP, P-CCPCH RSCP and the averaged received signal level as
specified in \[10\] and \[11\] for FDD, TDD and GSM cells, respectively.

The offset Qoffset1~s,n~ is used for Qoffset~s,n~ to calculate R~n~, the
hysteresis Qhyst1~s~ is used for Qhyst~s~ to calculate R~s~. For UE in
RRC connected mode states CELL\_PCH or URA\_PCH the hysteresis Qhyst~s~
takes the value Qhyst1~s,PCH~ to calculate R~s~, if provided in SIB4
\[see 4\]. For UE in RRC connected mode state CELL\_FACH the hysteresis
Qhyst~s~ takes the value Qhyst1~s,FACH~ to calculate R~s~, if provided
in SIB4 \[see 4\].

If the usage of HCS is indicated in system information, TEMP\_OFFSET1~n~
is used for TEMP\_OFFSET~n~ to calculate TO~n~. If it is indicated in
system information that HCS is not used, TEMP\_OFFSET~n~ is not applied
when calculating R~n~. The best ranked cell is the cell with the highest
R value.

If a TDD or GSM cell is ranked as the best cell, then the UE shall
perform cell re-selection to that TDD or GSM cell.

If an FDD cell is ranked as the best cell and the quality measure for
cell selection and re-selection is set to CPICH RSCP, the UE shall
perform cell re-selection to that FDD cell. If this cell is found to be
not suitable, the UE shall behave according to subclause 5.2.6.1.3.

If an FDD cell is ranked as the best cell and the quality measure for
cell selection and re-selection is set to CPICH Ec/No, the UE shall
perform a second ranking of the FDD cells according to the R criteria
specified above, but using the measurement quantity CPICH Ec/No for
deriving the Q~meas,n~ and Q~meas,s~ and calculating the R values of the
FDD cells. The offset Qoffset2~s,n~ is used for Qoffset~s,n~ to
calculate R~n~, the hysteresis Qhyst2~s~ is used for Qhyst~s~ to
calculate R~s~. For UE in RRC connected mode states CELL\_PCH or
URA\_PCH the hysteresis Qhyst~s~ takes the value Qhyst2~s,PCH~ to
calculate R~s~, if provided in SIB4 \[see 4\]. For UE in RRC connected
mode state CELL\_FACH the hysteresis Qhyst~s~ takes the value
Qhyst2~s,FACH~ to calculate R~s~, if provided in SIB4 \[see 4\]. If the
usage of HCS is indicated in system information, TEMP\_OFFSET2~n~ is
used to calculate TO~n~. If it is indicated in system information that
HCS is not used, TEMP\_OFFSET~n~ is not applied when calculating R~n~.
Following this second ranking, the UE shall perform cell re-selection to
the best ranked FDD cell. If this cell is found to be not suitable, the
UE shall behave according to subclause 5.2.6.1.3.

In all cases, the UE shall reselect the new cell, only if the following
conditions are met:

\- the new cell is better ranked than the serving cell during the
preceding time interval Treselection. For UE in RRC connected mode
states CELL\_PCH or URA\_PCH the interval Treselection~s,PCH~ applies,
if provided in SIB4 \[see 4\], while for UE in RRC connected mode state
CELL\_FACH the interval Treselection~s,FACH~ applies, if provided in
SIB4 \[see 4\]. For hierarchical cell structures when high-mobility
state has not been detected, if according to the HCS rules the serving
cell is not ranked then all the ranked cells are considered to be better
ranked than the serving cell. In case the UE reselects to a cell on an
MBMS preferred frequency to receive an MBMS service not available on the
current frequency the UE may reduce interval Treselection~S~,
Treselection~S,\ PCH~ and Treselection~S,\ FACH~.

Additionally the UE shall apply the following scaling rules to
Treselection~s~ or Treselection~s,PCH~ or Treselection~s,FACH~:

\- For intra-frequency cells and high-mobility state not detected:

\- no scaling applied.

\- For intra-frequency cells and high-mobility state is detected:

\- multiply Treselection~s~ or Treselection~s,PCH~ or
Treselection~s,FACH~ by the IE \"Speed dependent ScalingFactor for
Treselection\" if sent on system information.

\- For inter-frequency cells and high-mobility state not detected:

\- multiply Treselection~s~ or Treselection~s,PCH~ or
Treselection~s,FACH~ by the IE \"Inter-frequency ScalingFactor for
Treselection\" if sent on system information.

\- For inter-frequency cells and high-mobility state is detected:

\- multiply Treselection~s~ or Treselection~s,PCH~ or
Treselection~s,FACH~ by both the IEs \"Speed dependent ScalingFactor for
Treselection\" if sent on system information and \"Inter-frequency
ScalingFactor for Treselection\" if sent on system information.

\- For inter-RAT cells and high-mobility state not detected:

\- multiply Treselection~s~ or Treselection~s,PCH~ or
Treselection~s,FACH~ by the IE \"Inter-RAT ScalingFactor for
Treselection\" if sent on system information.

\- For inter-RAT cells and high-mobility state is detected:

\- multiply Treselection~s~ or Treselection~s,PCH~ or
Treselection~s,FACH~ by both the IEs \"Speed dependent ScalingFactor for
Treselection\" if sent on system information and \"Inter-RAT
ScalingFactor for Treselection\" if sent on system information.

In case scaling is applied to Treselection~s~ or Treselection~s,PCH~,
the UE shall round up the result after all scalings to the nearest
second. In case scaling is applied to Treselection~s,FACH~, the UE shall
round up the result after all scalings to the nearest 0.2 seconds.

\- more than 1 second has elapsed since the UE camped on the current
serving cell.

\- For FDD the UE does not have an allocated common E-DCH resource.

\- For 1.28 Mcps TDD, the UE does not have CELL Reselection Indication
procedure ongoing.

For FDD the UE continues taking intra-frequency measurements and ranking
cells while it has an allocated common E-DCH resource. If supported by
the UE and configured to perform Cell Reselection Indication Reporting,
the UE shall inform the MAC layer that the cell reselection criteria are
met.

For 1.28 Mcps TDD, the UE continues taking measurements and ranking
cells while it has the CELL Reselection Indication procedure ongoing as
in \[19\].

##### 5.2.6.1.4a Absolute priority based criteria for inter-frequency and inter-RAT cell reselection

Absolute priorities of different absolute priority layers may be
provided to the UE. The following cell reselection criteria are used for
inter-frequency cells if absolute priority information for
inter-frequency is available to the UE, and inter-RAT cells if absolute
priority information for inter-RAT is available to the UE.

If System Information Block 18 with UTRAN information is provided then
the UE shall apply the inter-frequency priority rules below only to
UTRAN cells of the selected PLMN or equivalent PLMNs. If System
Information Block 18 is not provided, or is provided but contains no
information for UTRAN, then the rules below apply for the entire UTRAN
RAT.

If System Information Block 18 with GERAN information is provided then
the UE shall apply the GERAN RAT priority rules below only to GERAN
cells of the selected PLMN or equivalent PLMNs. If System Information
Block 18 is not provided, or is provided but contains no information for
GERAN, then the rules below apply for the entire GERAN RAT.

If priority information is provided for any inter-frequency layers,
cells belonging to inter-frequency layers for which no priority or no
threshold is assigned shall not be considered for reselection.

If priority information is provided for any inter-RAT layers in a RAT,
cells belonging to layers in that RAT for which no priority or no
threshold is assigned shall not be considered for reselection.

If none of the inter-frequency layers in UTRAN are provided with both
priority and threshold parameters, the cell reselection criteria in
subclause 5.2.6.1.4 shall apply for inter-frequency layers in UTRAN.

If none of the inter-RAT layers in a RAT are provided with both priority
and threshold parameters, the cell reselection criteria in subclause
5.2.6.1.4 shall apply for that RAT.

If both criteria in subclause 5.2.6.1.4 and criteria in subclause
5.2.6.1.4a are simultaneously fullfilled, the order in which the
reselection criteria are evaluated is left to UE implementation.

NOTE: In order not to apply absolute priority but the cell reselection
criteria in subclause 5.2.6.1.4 for inter-frequencies cell reselection
in UTRAN or for inter-RAT cell reselection, the network may choose to
configure no inter-frequency layers in UTRAN or no inter-RAT layers in a
RAT in SIB19 even though dedicated priorities are provided.

For all inter-frequency layers or all inter-RAT layers belonging to one
RAT, either the criteria below or the criteria in subclause 5.2.6.1.4
shall apply.

The UE may apply either priorities broadcast in system information or
priorities received through dedicated signalling. The rules regarding
which set of priorities shall apply are defined in \[4\]. UE specific
priorities shall be cleared when the validity time of the UE specific
priorities expires, or when a PLMN selection is performed on request by
NAS. UE specific priorities are not applied in camped on any cell state.

When the UE in *camped normally* state, has only dedicated priorities
other than for the current frequency, the UE shall consider the current
frequency to be the lowest priority frequency (i.e. lower than any of
network configured values).

The UE shall inherit the priorities provided by dedicated signalling and
the remaining validity time (i.e., T320 in E-UTRA, T322 in UTRA and
T3230 in GERAN), if configured, at inter-RAT cell (re)selection.

The following definitions apply for the layers for which Thresh~x,high2~
or Thresh~x,low2~ are not provided:

\- Criterion 1: the Srxlev~nonServingCell,x~ of a cell on an evaluated
higher absolute priority layer is greater than Thresh~x,high~ during a
time interval Treselection;

\- Criterion 2: (Srxlev~ServingCell~ \< Thresh~serving,low~ or
Squal~ServingCell~ \< = Thresh~serving,low2~) and the
Srxlev~nonServingCell,x~ of a inter-frequency cell on an evaluated equal
absolute priority layer is greater than Thresh~x,low~ during a time
interval Treselection;

\- Criterion 3: (Srxlev~ServingCell~ \< Thresh~serving,low~ or
Squal~ServingCell~ \<= Thresh~serving,low2~) and the
Srxlev~nonServingCell,x~ of a cell on an evaluated lower absolute
priority layer is greater than Thresh~x,low~ during a time interval
Treselection;

The following definitions apply for the layers for which both
Thresh~x,high2~ and Thresh~x,low2~ are provided:

\- Criterion 4: the Squal~nonServingCell,x~ of a cell on an evaluated
higher absolute priority layer is greater than Thresh~x,high2~ during a
time interval Treselection;

\- Criterion 5: for FDD, (Srxlev~ServingCell~ \< =Thresh~serving,low~ or
Squal~ServingCell~ \< Thresh~serving,low2~) and the
Squal~nonServingCell,x~ of a cell on an evaluated lower absolute
priority layer is greater than Thresh~x,low2~ during a time interval
Treselection; for 1.28 Mcps TDD, (Srxlev~ServingCell~ \<
Thresh~serving,low~) and the Squal~nonServingCell,x~ of a cell on an
evaluated lower absolute priority layer is greater than Thresh~x,low2~
during a time interval Treselection;

Cell reselection to a cell on a higher absolute priority layer than the
camped frequency shall be performed if criterion 1 or 4 is fulfilled.

Cell reselection to an inter-frequency cell on an equal absolute
priority layer to the camped frequency shall be performed if criterion 2
is fulfilled.

Cell reselection to a cell on a lower absolute priority layer than the
camped frequency shall be performed if criterion 3 or 5 is fulfilled.

If more than one cell meets the above criteria, the UE shall reselect
the cell with the highest Srxlev~nonServingCell,x~ among the cells
meeting the criteria on the highest absolute priority layer.

The UE shall not perform cell reselection to cells for which the cell
selection criterion S is not fulfilled.

The UE shall not perform cell reselection until more than 1 second has
elapsed since the UE camped on the current serving cell.

The UE shall not consider any black listed cells as candidate for cell
reselection to E-UTRA.

In CELL\_FACH state, the UE shall not perform cell reselection to E-UTRA
when E-UTRA measurement for CELL\_FACH is configured. Except in the case
that the cell reselection is to an E-UTRA CSG member cell, in this case
cell reselection is performed as defined in \[18\].

The UE should not perform cell reselection while the UE has an allocated
common E-DCH resource.

For UE in RRC connected mode states CELL\_PCH or URA\_PCH the interval
Treselection~s,PCH~ applies, if provided in SIB4 (see \[4\]), while for
UE in RRC connected mode state CELL\_FACH the interval
Treselection~s,FACH~ applies, if provided in SIB4 (see \[4\]).

In all the above criteria the values of Treselection~s~,
Treselection~s,PCH~ or Treselection~s,FACH~ apply for Treselection and
are scaled according to the UE mobility state, as specified in
5.2.6.1.1a. For UTRA cells apply the scaling rules in 5.2.6.1.4. For GSM
cells apply the scaling rules in 5.2.6.1.4 if \"GSM ScalingFactor for
Treselection\" is not sent on system information, else follow the rules
below for GSM. For EUTRA cells apply the scaling rules in 5.2.6.1.4 if
\"E-UTRA ScalingFactor for Treselection\" is not sent on system
information, else follow the rules below for EUTRA.

\- The UE shall apply the following scaling rules to Treselection~s~ or
Treselection~s,PCH~ or Treselection~s,FACH~:

\- For inter-RAT cells and high-mobility state not detected:

\- for GERAN cells multiply Treselection~s~ or Treselection~s,PCH~ or
Treselection~s,FACH~ by the IE \"GSM ScalingFactor for Treselection\" if
sent on system information.

\- for EUTRA cells multiply Treselection~s~ or Treselection~s,PCH~ or
Treselection~s,FACH~ by the IE \"E-UTRA ScalingFactor for Treselection\"
if sent on system information.

\- For inter-RAT cells and high-mobility state is detected:

\- for GERAN cells multiply Treselection~s~ or Treselection~s,PCH~ or
Treselection~s,FACH~ by both the IEs \"Speed dependent ScalingFactor for
Treselection\" if sent on system information and \"GSM ScalingFactor for
Treselection\" if sent on system information.

\- for EUTRA cells multiply Treselection~s~ or Treselection~s,PCH~ or
Treselection~s,FACH~ by both the IEs \"Speed dependent ScalingFactor for
Treselection\" if sent on system information and \"E-UTRA ScalingFactor
for Treselection\" if sent on system information.

In case scaling is applied to Treselection~s~ or Treselection~s,PCH~,
the UE shall round up the result after all scalings to the nearest
second. In case scaling is applied to Treselection~s,FACH~, the UE shall
round up the result after all scalings to the nearest 0.2 seconds.

Cell reselection from UTRAN to E-UTRAN, for which Squal (RSRQ) based
cell reselection parameters are broadcast in system information, shall
be performed based on the Squal criteria (criterion 4 or 5) if the UE
supports Squal based cell reselection from E-UTRAN to UTRAN. Otherwise,
cell reselection to E-UTRAN shall be performed based on Srxlev criteria.

**Dedicated CSG frequency**

This specifies a frequency which is used for CSG deployment only.

#### 5.2.6.2 GSM case

The cell reselection procedure in GSM, including reselection from GSM to
UTRA, is specified in \[1\].

#### 5.2.6.3 E-UTRA case

The cell reselection procedure in E-UTRA, including inter-RATs
reselection, is specified in \[18\].

#### 5.2.6.4 Cell reselection with CSG cells

##### 5.2.6.4.1 Cell reselection from a non-CSG cell to a CSG cell

In addition to normal cell reselection, the UE shall use an autonomous
search function to detect at least previously visited CSG member cells
on serving frequency, non serving frequencies and inter-RAT frequencies,
according to the performance requirements specified in \[10\], when at
least one CSG with associated PLMN identity ID is included in the UE\'s
CSG whitelist. The UE is required to perform autonomous search function
in Idle, Cell\_PCH, URA\_PCH and CELL\_FACH states. For CELL\_FACH, the
autonomous search function for reselection to non-serving frequencies
and inter-RAT frequencies needs only to be performed when second DRX is
used. The UE shall disable the autonomous search function for CSG cells
if the UE\'s CSG whitelist is empty. If \"Dedicated CSG frequency(ies)
\" IE is present, the UE may use the autonomous search function only on
these dedicated frequencies and on the other frequencies listed in the
system information.

NOTE: The UE autonomous search function, per UE implementation,
determines when and/or where to search for CSG member cells.

When the UE has no or an empty CSG whitelist, the UE may ignore cells
with PSC in the stored range \"CSG PSC Split Information\" \[4\]
reserved for CSG cells for intra-frequency and inter-frequency
measurements and cell re-selections.

If the UE detects a suitable CSG cell on the same frequency it shall
reselect this cell if the concerned CSG cell is the highest ranked cell,
according to 5.2.6.1.4.

If the UE detects a suitable CSG cell on a different frequency it shall
reselect this cell irrespective of the cell reselection rules applicable
for the cell the UE is currently camped on, if the detected suitable CSG
cell is the strongest cell on that frequency. If suitable CSG cells are
detected on different frequencies and these are the strongest cells on
their frequencies, then the UE shall reselect to any one of them.

If the UE detects one or more suitable CSG cell on another RAT, the UE
shall reselect to one of them according to \[18\].

##### 5.2.6.4.2 Cell reselection from a CSG cell to non-CSG cell

While camped on a suitable CSG cell, the UE shall consider the frequency
of the serving cell to be the highest priority frequency (i.e. higher
than any of network configured values or highest HCS priority) and shall
not reselect to non-CSG cell as long as the serving cell remains the
highest ranked cell on that frequency (This includes the case when the
UE has only dedicated priorities for other frequencies but not for the
current frequency, i.e. the UE does not consider the current frequency
to be the lowest priority frequency according to rules in 5.2.6.1.2a and
5.2.6.1.4a). Cell reselection rules as defined in section 5.2.6.1 are
applied for cell reselection from a CSG cell to non-CSG cell.

##### 5.2.6.4.3 Cell reselection from a CSG cell to a CSG cell

To search for CSG cells not listed in the system information of the
serving CSG cell, the UE may use the autonomous search function when at
least one CSG ID with associated PLMN identity is included in the UE\'s
CSG whitelist. The UE is required to perform autonomous search function
in Idle, Cell\_PCH, URA\_PCH and CELL\_FACH states. For CELL\_FACH, the
autonomous search function for reselection to non-serving frequencies
and inter-RAT frequencies needs only to be performed when second DRX is
used. If \"Dedicated CSG frequency(ies)\" IE is present, the UE may use
the autonomous search function only on dedicated frequencies and on
other frequencies listed in the system information.

If the UE detects a suitable CSG cell on the same frequency, it shall
reselect to this cell if the concerned CSG cell is the highest ranked
cell, according to 5.2.6.1.4.

While camped on a suitable CSG cell, the UE shall consider the frequency
of the serving cell to be the highest priority frequency (i.e. higher
than any of network configured values or highest HCS priority) as long
as the serving cell is the highest ranked cell on that frequency (This
includes the case when the UE has only dedicated priorities for other
frequencies but not for the current frequency, i.e. the UE does not
consider the current frequency to be the lowest priority frequency
according to rules in 5.2.6.1.2a and 5.2.6.1.4a).

If the UE detects one or more suitable CSG cell on another RAT, the UE
may reselect to one of them according to \[18\].

For reselection to neighbour CSG cells listed in the system information
of the serving CSG cell the UE shall apply cell measurement rules
according to 5.2.6. If the UE detects a suitable CSG cell that is listed
in the system information of the serving cell on other frequencies, and
the detected CSG cell is the strongest cell on that frequency, then the
UE shall consider these frequencies to have a priority equal to the
current frequency and shall follow cell reselection rules according to
5.2.6.1.4 and 5.2.6.1.4a.

#### 5.2.6.5 Cell Reselection with Hybrid Cells

In addition to normal cell reselection rules, the UE shall use an
autonomous search function to detect at least previously visited hybrid
cells whose CSG ID and associated PLMN identity is in the UE\'s CSG
whitelist according to the performance requirements specified in \[10\].
The UE shall treat detected hybrid cells as CSG cells if the CSG ID and
any of the broadcasted PLMN identity of the hybrid cell is in the UE\'s
CSG whitelist and as normal cells otherwise.

### 5.2.7 Cell Selection when leaving connected mode

#### 5.2.7.1 UTRA case

When returning to idle mode from connected mode, the UE shall select a
suitable cell to camp on. Candidate cells for this selection are the
cell(s) used immediately before leaving connected mode. If no suitable
cell is found, the UE shall use the Stored information cell selection
procedure in order to find a suitable cell to camp on.

When returning to idle mode after an emergency call on any PLMN, the UE
shall select an acceptable cell to camp on. Candidate cells for this
selection are the cell(s) used immediately before leaving connected
mode. If no acceptable cell is found, the UE shall continue to search
for an acceptable cell of any PLMN in state Any cell selection.

#### 5.2.7.2 GSM case

Cell selection when leaving connected mode in GSM is specified in \[1\].

#### 5.2.7.3 E-UTRA case

Cell selection when leaving connected mode in E-UTRA is specified in
\[18\].

### 5.2.8 Any Cell Selection state

In this state, the UE shall attempt to find an acceptable cell of an any
PLMN to camp on, trying all RATs that are supported by the UE and
searching first for a high quality cell, as defined in subclause
5.1.2.2.

The UE, which is not camped on any cell, shall stay in this state until
an acceptable cell is found.

### 5.2.9 Camped on Any Cell State

#### 5.2.9.1 UTRA case

In this state, the UE shall perform the following tasks:

\- select and monitor the indicated PICH and PCH of the cell as
specified in clause 8;

\- monitor relevant System Information; This is specified in \[4\];

\- perform necessary measurements for the cell reselection evaluation
procedure;

\- Execute the cell reselection evaluation process on the following
occasions/triggers:

1\) UE internal triggers, so as to meet performance as specified in
\[10\] and \[11\];

2\) When information on the BCCH used for the cell reselection
evaluation procedure has been modified;

\- regularly attempt to find a suitable cell trying all RATs that are
supported by the UE. If a suitable cell is found, this causes an exit to
number 2 in Figure 2.

In this state the UE is not permitted to receive any MBMS services.

#### 5.2.9.2 GSM case

The camped on any cell state in GSM is specified in \[1\].

#### 5.2.9.3 E-UTRA case

The camped on any cell state in E-UTRA is specified in \[18\].

5.3 Cell Reservations and Access Restrictions (cells not operating in MBSFN mode)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 5.3.1 UTRA cells

There are two mechanisms which allow an operator to impose cell
reservations or access restrictions. The first mechanism uses indication
of cell status and special reservations for control of cell selection
and re-selection procedures. The second mechanism, referred to as Access
Control, shall allow to prevent selected classes of users from sending
initial access messages for load control reasons. At subscription, one
or more Access Classes are allocated to the subscriber and stored in the
USIM \[9\], which are employed for this purpose.

#### 5.3.1.1 Cell status and cell reservations

Cell status and cell reservations are indicated with the *Cell Access
Restriction* Information Element in the System Information Message \[4\]
by means of four Information Elements:

\- Cell barred (IE type: \"barred\" or \"not barred\"),

\- Cell Reserved for operator use (IE type: \"reserved\" or \"not
reserved\"),

\- Cell reserved for future extension (IE type: \"reserved\" or \"not
reserved\").

\- Cell reserved for CSG (IE type: \"true\" or not present).

When cell status is indicated as \"not barred\", \"not reserved\" for
operator use and \"not reserved\" for future extension (Cell Reservation
Extension),

\- All UEs shall treat this cell as candidate during the cell selection
and cell re-selection procedures in Idle mode and in Connected mode.

When cell status is indicated as \"not barred\", \"not reserved\" for
operator use and \"reserved\" for future extension (Cell Reservation
Extension),

\- If Cell Reserved for CSG is indicated then CSG capable UEs shall
behave as if cell status is indicated as \"not reserved\" for future
extension (Cell Reservation Extension).

\- If Cell Reserved for CSG is not indicated then UEs shall behave as if
cell status \"barred\" is indicated using the value \"not allowed\" in
the IE \"Intra-frequency cell re-selection indicator\" and the maximum
value for T~barred~, see \[4\] (see also below).

When cell status is indicated as \"not barred\" and \"reserved\" for
operator use,

\- If the UE is assigned an Access Class 11 or 15 and if the cell
belongs to the home PLMN or to any EHPLMN:

\- the UE shall treat this cell as candidate during the cell selection
and cell re-selection procedures in Idle mode and in Connected mode.

\- else:

\- UEs shall behave as if cell status \"barred\" is indicated using the
value \"not allowed\" in the IE \"Intra-frequency cell re-selection
indicator\" and the maximum value for T~barred~, see \[4\] (see also
below).

When cell status \"barred\" is indicated,

\- The UE is not permitted to select/re-select this cell, not even for
emergency calls.

\- The UE shall ignore the \"Cell Reserved for future extension (Cell
Reservation Extension) use\" IE.

\- The UE is not permitted to receive any MBMS services.

\- The UE shall select another cell according to the following rule:

\- If the \"Intra-frequency cell re-selection indicator\" IE in Cell
Access Restriction IE is set to value \"allowed\", the UE may select
another cell on the same frequency if selection/re-selection criteria
are fulfilled.

\- If the UE is camping on another cell, the UE shall exclude the barred
cell from the neighbouring cell list until the expiry of a time interval
T~barred~. The time interval T~barred~ is sent via system information in
a barred cell together with Cell status information in the Cell Access
Restriction IE.

\- If the UE does not select another cell, and the barred cell remains
to be the \"best\" one, the UE shall after expiry of the time interval
T~barred~ again check whether the status of the barred cell has changed.

\- If the \"Intra-frequency cell re-selection indicator\" IE is set to
\"not allowed\" the UE shall not re-select a cell on the same frequency
as the barred cell. During an ongoing emergency call, the
Intra-frequency cell re-selection indicator IE\" shall be ignored, i.e.
even if it is set to \"not allowed\" the UE may select another
intra-frequency cell.

\- If the barred cell remains to be the \"best\" one, the UE shall after
expiry of the time interval T~barred~ again check whether the status of
the barred cell has changed.

If the \"Intra-frequency cell re-selection indicator\" IE has been read
from a CSG cell it shall be ignored by the UE and the UE is allowed to
reselect another cell on the same frequency if the cell reselection
criteria are fulfilled.

The reselection to another cell may also include a change of RAT.

#### 5.3.1.2 Access Control

Information on cell access restrictions associated with the Access
Classes and ACDC are broadcast as system information, \[4\].

The UE shall ignore Access Class related cell access restrictions when
selecting a cell to camp on, i.e. it shall not reject a cell for camping
on because access on that cell is not allowed for any of the Access
Classes of the UE. A change of the indicated access restriction shall
not trigger cell re-selection by the UE.

Access Class related cell access restrictions shall be checked by the UE
before sending an RRC connection request message when entering Connected
Mode from UTRAN Idle mode. Access Class related cell access
restrictions, if it is sent as a part of Domain Specific Access
Restriction parameters, shall also be checked by the UE before sending
INITIAL DIRECT TRANSFER message. Access Class related cell access
restrictions, if it is sent as a part of Paging Permission with Access
Control Parameters, shall be checked by the UE before sending a response
to Paging message or before initiating a Location/Registration
procedure. Access Class related cell access restrictions, if it is sent
as a part of Extended Access Barring parameters, shall be checked by the
UE before sending an RRC connection request message or INITIAL DIRECT
TRANSFER message subject to extended access barring as indicated by
higher layers. Otherwise, cell access restrictions associated with the
Access Classes shall not apply for a UE which already is in Connected
Mode.

For Access Class 0 to 9, ACDC related cell access restrictions, if it is
sent in ACDC Barring Information paramerers shall be checked by the UE
before sending an RRC connection request message when entering Connected
Mode from UTRAN Idle mode in PS domain.

#### 5.3.1.3 Emergency Call

A restriction on emergency calls, if needed, shall be indicated in the
\"Access class barred list\" IE \[4\]. If access class 10 is indicated
as barred in a cell, UEs with access class 0 to 9 or without an IMSI are
not allowed to initiate emergency calls in this cell. For UEs with
access classes 11 to 15, emergency calls are not allowed if both access
class 10 and the relevant access class (11 to 15) are barred. Otherwise,
emergency calls are allowed for those UEs.

Full details of operation under \"Access class barred list\" are
described in \[9\].

### 5.3.2 GSM cells

reserved\" for operator use and \"not reserved\" for future extension
(Cell Reservation Extension), and Cell Barred is set to \"barred\" or
\"not barred\",

\- All UEs shall treat this MBSFN cluster as a candidate during the
MBSFN cluster selection and MBSFN cluster re-selection procedures.

For an MBSFN cluster (see \[4\]) when cell status is indicated as \"not
reserved\" for operator use and \"reserved\" for future extension (Cell
Reservation Extension),

\- UEs shall not consider this MBSFN cluster as a candidate during the
MBSFN cluster selection and MBSFN cluster re-selection procedures. The
UE may choose to not recheck the status of this MBSFN cluster during the
time corresponding to the maximum value for T~barred~ (see \[4\]).

For an MBSFN cluster (see \[4\]) when cell status is indicated as
\"reserved\" for operator use,

\- if a UE is assigned to Access Class 11 or 15 and the MBSFN cluster
belongs to the home PLMN or to any EHPLMN:

\- the UE shall treat this MBSFN cluster as a candidate during the MBSFN
cluster selection and MBSFN cluster re-selection procedures.

\- else:

\- UEs shall not consider this MBSFN cluster as candidate during the
MBSFN cluster selection and MBSFN cluster re-selection procedures The UE
may choose to not recheck the status of this MBSFN cluster during the
time corresponding to the maximum value for T~barred~ (see \[4\]).

The *cell selection* process in Connected Mode is for \'out of service\'
conditions \[4\] is the same as the *cell selection process* used for
idle mode, described in subclause 5.2.3.

Selection of a suitable cell during a state transition or a change of
frequency in Connected Mode is the same as the selection of a suitable
UTRA cell used for idle mode, described in subclause 5.2.3.1. If the UE
is ordered to select a suitable UTRA cell on a given frequency, it shall
attempt to select a suitable cell on that frequency before considering
cells on other frequencies.

5.5 Location Registration
-------------------------

In the UE, the AS shall report registration area information to the NAS.

If the UE reads more than one PLMN identity in the current cell, the UE
shall report the found PLMN identities that make the cell suitable in
the registration area information to NAS.

The non-access part of the location registration process is specified in
\[5\].

Actions for the UE AS upon reception of Location Registration reject are
specified in \[9\] and \[16\].

5.6 Support for manual CSG Selection
------------------------------------

### 5.6.1 UTRA case

In the UE on request of NAS, the AS shall scan all RF channels in the
UTRA bands according to its capabilities to find available CSGs. On each
carrier, the UE shall at least search for the strongest cell, read its
system information and report available CSG ID(s) together with their
\"HNB name\" (if broadcast) and PLMN(s) to the NAS. The search for
available CSGs may be stopped on request of the NAS.

If NAS has selected a CSG and provided this selection to AS, the UE
shall search for an acceptable or suitable cell belonging to the
selected CSG to camp on.

### 5.6.2 E-UTRA case

Support for manual CSG selection in E-UTRA is described in \[18\].

5.7 Logged Measurements
-----------------------

The UE may be configured to perform logging of measurement results in
idle mode, CELL\_PCH, URA\_PCH states and CELL\_FACH state when second
DRX cycle is used with LOGGING MEASUREMENT CONFIGURATION message
specified in TS 25.331 \[4\]. This configuration is valid while the
logging duration timer is running.

If the configuration of logged measurements is valid, the UE shall
perform logging of measurement results if all of the following
conditions are met:

\- the UE is in *camped normally* state in idle mode, CELL\_PCH or
URA\_PCH states or CELL\_FACH state when second DRX cycle is used;

MEASUREMENT CONFIGURATION message reception;

\- the UE is camped on a cell belonging to Area Configuration (see TS
25.331 \[4\]), if configured;

\- the UE is camped on the RAT where the logged measurement
configuration was received.

Otherwise, the logging of measurement results shall be suspended.

NOTE: Even if logging of measurement results is suspended, the logging
duration timer and time stamp will continue, and the logged measurement
configuration and corresponding log are kept.

5.8 Logged UTRAN ANR
--------------------

### 5.8.1 General

The UE may be configured to perform UTRAN ANR measurement and logging in
IDLE mode, CELL\_PCH, URA\_PCH state and CELL\_FACH state when second

list and log corresponding information of the detected set cells as
specified in TS 25.331 \[4\].

#### 5.8.2.2 Inter-RAT ANR case

If configured to perform inter-RAT ANR via the Logging Measurement
Configuration message, the UE may perform inter-RAT ANR logging only
when:

\- after inter-RAT cell reselection from E-UTRAN or GSM to a normal
UTRAN cell belonging to the PLMN or the list of Equivalent PLMNs where
the Logging Measurement Configuration is received.

During the inter-RAT ANR process, the UE may log the corresponding
information of the previously camped E-UTRAN or GSM cell as specified in
TS 25.331 \[4\].

procedure fails as specified in TS 25.331 \[4\].

5.10 RAN-assisted WLAN interworking
-----------------------------------

The purpose of this procedure is to facilitate RAN-assisted WLAN
interworking.

### 5.10.1 RAN assistance parameter handling in Idle mode, CELL\_PCH, URA\_PCH and CELL\_FACH

UEs in idle mode or in CELL\_FACH, CELL\_PCH or URA\_PCH state shall
store and apply RAN assistance parameters for the rules in sub-clause
5.10.2 as defined in the following:

\- RAN assistance parameters received in System information block type
23 are used only if the UE is in camped *normally* state;

\- upon cell reselection, and cell selection to another cell than the
serving cell (or the best cell in case of UEs previously in CELL\_DCH
state and configured with DCHs only), the UE shall discard the RAN
assistance parameters received in the UTRAN MOBILITY INFORMATION message
or in the CELL UPDATE CONFIRM message and apply the RAN assistance
parameters received in System information block type 23.

### 5.10.2 Access network selection and traffic steering rules

The rules in this sub-clause are only applicable for WLANs for which
identifiers have been signaled to the UE by UTRAN and the UE is capable
of access network selection and traffic steering rules. Coexistence with
ANDSF based WLAN selection and traffic steering methods on the UE is
based on mechanism described in TS 23.402 \[23\]. The rules refer to the
following WLAN quantities:

  ------------------------ -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  ChannelUtilizationWLAN   WLAN channel utilization as defined in sub-clause 8.4.2.30 in \[24\].

The UE shall not consider the metrics for which a threshold has not been
provided. The UE shall evaluate the UTRAN conditions on the serving cell
in Idle mode, URA\_PCH, CELL\_PCH, CELL\_FACH and CELL\_DCH.

If the FDD UE is configured with DCH only, the reference cell to use,
for the rules defined in this sub-clause, is the best cell in active
set.

6 Broadcast information receiving
=================================

6.1 Reception of System Information
-----------------------------------

Requirements are specified in \[4\].

6.2 Cell Broadcast in Idle Mode, CELL\_PCH and URA\_PCH
-------------------------------------------------------

A UE supporting Cell Broadcast Service (CBS) shall be capable to receive
BMC messages in the Idle mode, in URA\_PCH and CELL\_PCH. When several
PCHs exist in the cell, the FACH which carries the CTCH may be mapped to
a different SCCPCH than the PCH selected by the UE for paging in Idle
mode (as specified in Sec. 8.1). In this case, UEs with basic service
capabilities shall be capable to change from the SCCPCH that carries the
PCH selected for paging to another SCCPCH which carries Cell Broadcast
messages (i.e. the CTCH mapped to an FACH) and receive BMC messages
during time intervals which do not conflict with the UE specific paging
occasions.

The second system information broadcast channel (BCH on SCCPCH) is
mapped on a separate SCCPCH, i.e. different from the SCCPCH which
carriers the FACH with CTCH. In case CTCH occasions collide with
transmissions of the second system information broadcast channel, the UE
supporting second system information broadcast channel may decide not to
receive the second broadcast channel.

NOTE: In case certain BMC messages conflict with the UE specific paging
occasions the reception of CBS cannot be guaranteed and depends on UE
capabilities.

6.3 MBMS Services
-----------------

If the UE has activated MBMS services and MBMS is available in the cell
(i.e., the MCCH information is provided on the BCCH) and the UE is
permitted to receive MBMS in the cell, the UE shall:

\- receive the MCCH as specified in clause 8.4 and in \[4\];

\- participate in MBMS counting as specified in \[4\];

\- receive each FACH on which the MTCH carrying an MBMS activated
service that does not require the establishment of an RRC connection is
mapped.

> The UE may:
>
> \- monitor the MICH as specified in clause 8a and in \[4\];

\- receive the MSCH.

### 6.3.1 MBSFN cluster selection and reselection 

#### 6.3.1.1 MBSFN cluster selection

MBSFN cluster selection/reselection process for MBSFN clusters operating
on the same frequency may be based on reception quality of the CPICH for
FDD and 3.84 Mcps TDD IMB or P-CCPCH for TDD. Details of the process are
not specified.

The UE shall search for MBSFN clusters if the frequencies on which MBSFN
clusters are available are not indicated in the cell that the UE is
camping on for normal service if the mobile is configured to receive
services via MBSFN mode. Details of the process are not specified.

For 1.28 Mcps TDD, the UE that needs receive MBMS services delivered in
an MBSFN cluster may at the first step select a non MBSFN cell (i.e. a
unicast cell), that the MBSFN cluster is associated with. The UE can get
synchronized to the MBSFN cluster with the help of the information
indicated in system information broadcast by the associated unicast
cell,and receive the system information and MCCH messages in the MBSFN
Special Timeslot. The details of the association between MBSFN clusters
and non MBSFN cells operating in a unicast carrier are not specified. In
case there are more than one MBSFN clusters indicated in system
information broadcast by a unicast cell, the process of which MBSFN
cluster should be selected for searching is not specified.

#### 6.3.1.2 Camped on MBSFN cluster 

When camped on a MBSFN cluster, the UE shall perform the following
tasks:

\- receive the MCCH as specified in clause 8.4 and in \[4\];

\- monitor the available MBMS services on the MBSFN cluster that the UE
is camping on

The UE may:

> \- monitor the MICH as specified in clause 8a and in \[4\];

\- receive the MSCH.

#### 6.3.1.3 MBSFN inter frequency neighbour information

Upon detection of one MBSFN cluster all other frequencies on which MBMS
service is provided in MBSFN mode for one of the PLMN assigned to the
MBSFN cluster are indicate as specified in \[4\].

The UE chooses the frequency for the MBSFN cluster to be received based
on the information on the services that are provided on the MBSFN
clusters of those frequencies.

In the case that the UE does not receive a service from the current
MBSFN cluster and the UE is configured to receive an MBMS service in
MBSFN mode it should attempt to receive information on ongoing services
as specified in \[4\].

======

8 Paging and SCCPCH selection and in FDD and 1.28 Mcps TDD the H-RNTI selection
===============================================================================

8.1 Paging Channel selection
----------------------------

System information block type 5 (SIB 5) and System information block
type 5bis (SIB 5bis)define common channels to be employed in Idle mode
\[4\]. In a cell, a single or several PCHs may be established. Each
Secondary Common Control Physical Channel (SCCPCH) indicated to the UE
in system information may carry up to one PCH. Thus, for each defined
PCH there is one uniquely associated PICH also indicated.

In case that more than a single PCH and associated PICH are defined in
SIB 5 or SIB 5bis, the UE shall perform a selection according to the
following rule:

\- The UE shall select a SCCPCH from the ones listed in SIB 5 or SIB
5bis based on IMSI as follows:

\"Index of selected SCCPCH\" = IMSI mod K,

where K is equal to the number of listed SCCPCHs which carry a PCH (i.e.
SCCPCHs carrying FACH only shall not be counted). These SCCPCHs shall be
indexed in the order of their occurrence in SIB 5 or SIB 5bis from 0 to
K-1.\
For GSM-MAP, i.e. \"IMSI (GSM-MAP)\" is given as sequence of digits of
type Integer(0..9), IMSI shall in the formula above be interpreted as a
decimal integer number, where the first digit given in the sequence
represents the highest order digit.\
For DS-41, i.e. \"IMSI (DS-41)\" is given as octet string, IMSI shall in
the formulae above correspond to the decoded decimal representation of
the IMSI-S part included in the octet string (see TIA/EIA/IS-2000-5).

> For example:

IMSI (GSM-MAP) = 12 (digit1=1, digit2=2)

In the calculations, this shall be interpreted as the decimal integer
\"12\", not \"1x16+2 = 18\".

\"Index of selected SCCPCH\" identifies the selected SCCPCH with the PCH
and the uniquely associated PICH to be used by the UE.

If the UE has no IMSI, for instance when making an emergency call
without USIM, the UE shall use as default number IMSI = 0.

8.2 SCCPCH selection when entering Connected mode
-------------------------------------------------

If HS-DSCH operation in CELL\_FACH state (FDD and 1.28 Mcps TDD) is not
configured to the cell, when entering Connected mode from Idle mode by
sending an RRC CONNECTION REQUEST message, the UE shall select the
S-CCPCH which carries an FACH to be used for reception of the RRC
CONNECTION SETUP message according to the following rule:

\- the UE shall select an SCCPCH from the SCCPCHs listed in System
Information Block type 5 (SIB 5) or System Information Block type 5bis
(SIB 5bis) based on \"Initial UE Identity\" as follows:

\"Index of selected SCCPCH\" = \"Initial UE Identity\" mod K,

where K is equal to the number of listed SCCPCHs which carry a FACH
(i.e. SCCPCHs carrying PCH only shall not be counted). These SCCPCHs
shall be indexed from 0 to K-1 in the order of their occurrence in SIB 5
or SIB 5bis, and \"Index of selected SCCPCH\" identifies the selected
SCCPCH. \"Initial UE Identity\" refers to the Information Element
included by the UE into the RRC CONNECTION REQUEST message. In the above
formula, the parameter \"Initial UE Identity\" shall be interpreted as
follows, depending on the choice of UE-Id type of the respective IE:

For UE-Id type \"IMSI (GSM-MAP)\", i.e. the IE is given as sequence of
digits of type Integer(0..9), \"Initial UE Identity\" shall be
interpreted as an integer number, where the first digit given in the
sequence represents the highest order digit.

For UE-Id types \"TMSI and LAI (GSM-MAP)\" or \"P-TMSI and RAI
(GSM-MAP)\", only the TMSI or P-TMSI parts given as Bitstring(32) shall
be used, and \"Initial UE Identity\" shall be interpreted as a binary
representation of an integer number, where the first bit in the
Bitstring represents the highest order bit.

> For UE-Id type \"IMEI\", i.e. the IE is given as sequence of
> hexadecimal digits of type Integer(0..15), \"Initial UE Identity\"
> shall be interpreted as a hexadecimal representation of an integer
> number, where the first digit given in the sequence represents the
> highest order digit.

For UE-Id type \"IMSI (DS-41)\", i.e. the IE is given as octet string,
\"Initial UE Identity\" shall correspond to the decoded decimal
representation of the IMSI-S part included in the octet string (see
TIA/EIA/IS-2000-5).

For UE-Id types \"ESN (DS-41)\" or \"TMSI (DS-41)\", i.e. the IE is
given as Bitstring(32), \"Initial UE Identity\" shall be interpreted as
a binary representation of an integer number, where the first bit in the
Bitstring represents the highest order bit.

> For UE-Id type \"IMSI and ESN (DS-41)\" only the ESN part shall be
> used as \"Initial UE Identity\", as defined above.

8.2b H-RNTI selection when entering Connected mode (FDD and 1.28 Mcps TDD)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

If HS-DSCH operation in CELL\_FACH state is configured to the cell in
System Information Block type 5 (SIB 5) or System Information Block type
5bis, when entering Connected mode from Idle mode by sending an RRC
CONNECTION REQUEST message, the UE shall start listening to the HS-SCCH
indicated in System Information Block type 5 (SIB 5) or in System
Information Block type 5bis (SIB 5bis).

The detection of HS-SCCH is based on Common H-RNTI listed in System
Information Block type 5 (SIB 5) or System Information Block type 5bis
(SIB 5bis). The UE shall select the Common H-RNTI to be used for
reception of the RRC CONNECTION SETUP message according to the following
rule:

\- the UE shall select a Common H-RNTI from the Common H-RNTIs listed in
System Information Block type 5 (SIB 5) or System Information Block type
5bis (SIB 5bis) based on \"Initial UE Identity\" as follows:

\"Index of selected Common H-RNTI\" = \"Initial UE Identity\" mod K,

\- where K is equal to the number of listed Common H-RNTI. These Common
H-RNTIs shall be indexed from 0 to K-1 in the order of their occurrence
in SIB 5 or SIB 5bis, and \"Index of selected Common H-RNTI\" identifies
the selected Common H-RNTI. \"Initial UE Identity\" refers to the
Information Element included by the UE into the RRC CONNECTION REQUEST
message. In the above formula, the parameter \"Initial UE Identity\"
shall be interpreted as follows, depending on the choice of UE-Id type
of the respective IE:

For UE-Id type \"IMSI (GSM-MAP)\", i.e. the IE is given as sequence of
digits of type Integer(0..9), \"Initial UE Identity\" shall be
interpreted as an integer number, where the first digit given in the
sequence represents the highest order digit.

For UE-Id types \"TMSI and LAI (GSM-MAP)\" or \"P-TMSI and RAI
(GSM-MAP)\", only the TMSI or P-TMSI parts given as Bitstring(32) shall
be used, and \"Initial UE Identity\" shall be interpreted as a binary
representation of an integer number, where the first bit in the
Bitstring represents the highest order bit.

> For UE-Id type \"IMEI\", i.e. the IE is given as sequence of
> hexadecimal digits of type Integer(0..15), \"Initial UE Identity\"
> shall be interpreted as a hexadecimal representation of an integer
> number, where the first digit given in the sequence represents the
> highest order digit.

For UE-Id type \"IMSI (DS-41)\", i.e. the IE is given as octet string,
\"Initial UE Identity\" shall correspond to the decoded decimal
representation of the IMSI-S part included in the octet string (see
TIA/EIA/IS-2000-5).

For UE-Id types \"ESN (DS-41)\" or \"TMSI (DS-41)\", i.e. the IE is
given as Bitstring(32), \"Initial UE Identity\" shall be interpreted as
a binary representation of an integer number, where the first bit in the
Bitstring represents the highest order bit.

> For UE-Id type \"IMSI and ESN (DS-41)\" only the ESN part shall be
> used as \"Initial UE Identity\", as defined above.

After detecting the HS-SCCH with Common H-RNTI, the UE start reception
of the corresponding HS-PDSCH(s) TTI.

8.3 Discontinuous Reception for Paging
--------------------------------------

The UE may use Discontinuous Reception (DRX) in idle mode in order to
reduce power consumption. When DRX is used the UE needs only to monitor
one Page Indicator, PI, (see definition in \[7\] and \[8\]) in one
Paging Occasion per DRX cycle.

The DRX cycle length shall be MAX(2^k^, PBP) frames, where k is an
integer and PBP is the Paging Block Periodicity. PBP is only applicable
for TDD and is equal to the PICH repetition period that is broadcast in
system information. For FDD, PBP=1.

The UE may be attached to different CN domains with different CN domain
specific DRX cycle lengths. The UE shall store each CN domain specific
DRX cycle length for each CN domain the UE is attached to and use the
shortest of those DRX cycle lengths. The CS CN specific DRX cycle length
coefficient shall be updated locally in the UE using information given
in system information. On the other hand, the PS CN specific DRX cycle
length coefficient shall be updated after the negotiation between the UE
and PS CN by NAS procedure. If no specific value \"k\" is negotiated in
NAS procedure, the UE and PS CN shall use the DRX cycle length given for
PS CN domain in system information.

The DRX cycle lengths to use for UTRAN connected mode is the shortest of
the following:

\- UTRAN DRX cycle length;

\- any of the stored CN domain specific DRX cycle length for the CN
domains the UE is only attached to with no signalling connection
established.

For TDD, and for FDD in IDLE mode as well as in RRC Connected mode, if
HS-DSCH operation in CELL\_PCH and URA\_PCH state is not configured to
the cell, or for 1.28 Mcps TDD if both HS-DSCH operation in CELL\_PCH
and URA\_PCH state and legacy PCH are configured to the cell but no
dedicated H-RNTI is allocated to the UE, the UE shall use the IMSI, the
number of available SCCPCH which carry a PCH (K) as derived according to
subclause 8.1,the Cell System Frame Number (SFN), Np (for FDD, Np is the
number of page indicators within a frame; for TDD, Np is the number of
page indicators within a paging block), Frame offset (For FDD, Frame
offset = 0; for TDD, PICH frame offset values are given in system
information), PBP and the DRX cycle length to determine the Paging
Occasions.

For FDD, if HS-DSCH operation in CELL\_PCH and URA\_PCH state is
configured to the cell, the UE in RRC Conneced mode shall use the IMSI,
the number of indexed PICH for HSDPA supported paging (K) as derived
from System Information Block Type 5 or System Information Block Type
5bis, the Cell System Frame Number (SFN), Np (Np is the number of page
indicators within a frame), Frame offset (Frame offset = 0), PBP and the
DRX cycle length to determine the Paging Occasions.

For 1.28 Mcps TDD, if HS-DSCH operation in CELL\_PCH and URA\_PCH state
is configured to the cell and no legacy PCH is configured in the cell,
or if both HS-DSCH operation in CELL\_PCH and URA\_PCH state and legacy
PCH are configured to the cell and the dedicated H-RNTI is allocated to
the UE, the UE in RRC Conneced mode shall use the IMSI, the number of
indexed PICH for HSDPA supported paging (K) as derived from System
Information Block Type 5 or System Information Block Type 5bis, the Cell
System Frame Number (SFN), Np (Np is the number of page indicators
within a frame), Frame offset, PBP and the DRX cycle length to determine
the Paging Occasions.

In FDD the UE shall monitor its paging indicator in the PICH frame with
SFN given by the Paging Occasion

In TDD the UE shall monitor its paging indicator in the paging block
given by the Paging Occasion. The Paging Occasion gives the SFN of the
first frame of the paging block.

The value of the Paging Occasion is determined as follows:

Paging Occasion= {(IMSI div K) mod (DRX cycle length div PBP)} \* PBP +
n \* DRX cycle length + Frame Offset

Where n = 0,1,2... as long as SFN is below its maximum value.

The actual Page Indicator within a Paging Occasion that the UE shall
read is similarly determined based on IMSI.

The Page Indicator to use is calculated by using the following formula:

PI = DRX Index mod Np

where DRX Index = IMSI div 8192

In FDD mode, Np = (18,36,72,144) is the number of Page Indicators per
frame, and is given in IE \"Number of PI per frame\", part of system
information in FDD mode. In TDD mode, Np is the number of Page
Indicators per paging block and is calculated by the Paging Indicator
Length L~PI,~ the Burst Type (long or short midamble for 3.84/7.68 Mcps
TDD) and the PICH repetition length, which are given in system
information.

If the UE has no IMSI, for instance when making an emergency call
without USIM, the UE shall use as default numbers, IMSI = 0 and DRX
cycle length = 256 (2.56 s), in the formulas above.

For FDD, see \[7\] for details about the timing between a PICH frame and
when the paging message is transmitted on the PCH in the associated
S-CCPCH frame.

In TDD mode, in case of PCCH mapping on PCH, the Paging Message
Receiving Occasion is calculated using the following formula:

Paging Message Receiving Occasion = Paging Occasion + N~PICH~ + N~GAP~ +
{(DRX Index mod Np) mod N~PCH~ } \*2

For 1.28 Mcps TDD, in case of PCCH on HS-DSCH, the Paging Message
Receiving Occasion is calculated using the following formula:

Paging Message Receiving Occasion = Paging Occasion + N~PICH~ + N~GAP~ +
{(DRX Index mod Np) mod N~HS-PCH~ } \*m

Where N~HS-PCH~ is the number of Paging sub-channels for PCCH on HS-DSCH
and m is the length of each sub-channel in Radio Frame. The timing of
PICH and Paging Message on HS-DSCH as well as the transmission pattern
of PCCH on HS-DSCH is defined in \[8\].

The value N~PICH~ is the number of frames for PICH transmission and is
equal to the PICH repetition length given in system information. The
value N~GAP~ is the number of frames between the last frame carrying
PICH for this Paging Occasion and the first frame carrying paging
messages for this Paging Occasion. The value N~PCH~ is the number of
Paging Groups. N~PCH~ and N~GAP~ are given in system information.

For GSM-MAP, i.e. \"IMSI (GSM-MAP)\" is given as sequence of digits of
type Integer(0..9), IMSI shall in the formulae above be interpreted as a
decimal integer number, where the first digit given in the sequence
represents the highest order digit.

For DS-41, i.e. \"IMSI (DS-41)\" is given as octet string, IMSI shall in
the formulae above correspond to the decoded decimal representation of
the IMSI-S part included in the octet string (see TIA/EIA/IS-2000-5).

For example:

IMSI (GSM-MAP) = 12 (digit1=1, digit2=2)

In the calculations, this shall be interpreted as the decimal integer
\"12\", not \"1x16+2 = 18\".

8.4 Discontinuous Reception for MBMS
------------------------------------

The UE may use discontinuous reception (DRX) on MBMS channels (MCCH,
MSCH, MTCH) to reduce power consumption while subscribed to MBMS
services.

### 8.4.1 Discontinuous Reception for MCCH

The UE may operate DRX on the MCCH either by monitoring the MICH to
determine when it needs to receive the MCCH or by using the MODIFIED
SERVICES INFORMATION message on the MCCH to determine that it does not
need to acquire the remainder of the MCCH information.

The timing of the MCCH information transmission and the need to receive
the MCCH are described in detail in \[4\].

#### 8.4.1.1 Discontinuous Reception via MICH

When the UE operates DRX on the MCCH through monitoring the MICH, the UE
needs to monitor one Notification Indicator (NI), as defined in \[7\],
\[8\], for each MBMS service it is subscribed to. For each service, a
corresponding NI will be set continuously through the entire length of
the modification period preceding a change in the associated MCCH
information. The modification period should be long enough that a UE
that only receives the MICH during its paging occasions can still
reliably detect a notification.

For each service, the 16 bit Notification Indicator to use is calculated
as a function of the TMGI:

> $\text{NI} = \left( \text{TMGI} + \left\lfloor \frac{\text{TMGI}}{G} \right\rfloor \right)\text{mod}G$,
> where *G* = 2^16^.

A UE with one or more activated MBMS services may monitor the MICH. The
exact timing with which the UE reads the MICH within a given
modification period is left to the UE implementation, with the proviso
that the UE needs to be able to detect notifications reliably for its
activated MBMS service(s).

The TMGI is structured as follows \[16\]:

+---------------+-------------+---------+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| 8             | 7           | 6       | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 |   |
+---------------+-------------+---------+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| Temporary     | Octet 1     |         |   |   |   |   |   |   |
| Mobile Group  |             |         |   |   |   |   |   |   |
| Identity IEI  |             |         |   |   |   |   |   |   |
+---------------+-------------+---------+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| Length of     | Octet 2     |         |   |   |   |   |   |   |
| Temporary     |             |         |   |   |   |   |   |   |
| Mobile Group  |             |         |   |   |   |   |   |   |
| Identity      |             |         |   |   |   |   |   |   |
| contents      |             |         |   |   |   |   |   |   |
+---------------+-------------+---------+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| MBMS Service  | Octet 3     |         |   |   |   |   |   |   |
| ID            |             |         |   |   |   |   |   |   |
|               | Octet 4     |         |   |   |   |   |   |   |
+---------------+-------------+---------+---+---+---+---+---+---+
|               | Octet 5     |         |   |   |   |   |   |   |
+---------------+-------------+---------+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| MCC digit 2   | MCC digit 1 | Octet 6 |   |   |   |   |   |   |
+---------------+-------------+---------+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| MNC digit 3   | MCC digit 3 | Octet 7 |   |   |   |   |   |   |
+---------------+-------------+---------+---+---+---+---+---+---+
| MNC digit 2   | MNC digit 1 | Octet 8 |   |   |   |   |   |   |
+---------------+-------------+---------+---+---+---+---+---+---+

NOTE: The MBMS Service identity, which is signalled in \[4\] (see
subclause 10.3.9a.8), concerns a signalling optimisation of the TMGI.

For the calculation of the NI, the TMGI shall be interpreted as a binary
representation of an integer number, represented by the bitstring formed
by the exclusive OR operation of the MBMS Service ID (octets 3 to 5 of
the TMGI) and the PLMN identity (octets 6 to 8 of the TMGI) with the
first/ leftmost/ most significant bit corresponding with b8 of the first
octet.

#### 8.4.1.2 Discontinuous Reception via MODIFIED SERVICES INFORMATION

If the UE receives the MODIFIED SERVICES INFORMATION message on the MCCH
and determines from its contents that no service whose information the
UE needs to acquire has been modified, the UE may refrain from receiving
the MCCH for the remainder of the modification period.

### 8.4.2 Discontinuous Reception for MTCH {#discontinuous-reception-for-mtch .list-paragraph}

If the UE operates DRX on the MTCH, the UE shall receive the MSCH as
described in \[4\] to obtain scheduling information for the MTCH.

The reception intervals for MBMS services are given by the IE \"Service
transmissions list\" in the MBMS SCHEDULING INFORMATION message on the
MSCH.

8a MBMS Notification
====================

The structure of the MICH is described in \[7\] and \[14\].

The RRC-layer behaviour of a UE receiving an MBMS notification indicator
is specified in \[4\].
