3.3 Definitions
---------------

**Assisting secondary serving HS-DSCH Cell: In addition to the serving
HS-DSCH cell, a cell in the secondary downlink frequency, where the UE
is configured to simultaneously monitor a HS-SCCH set and receive
HS-DSCH if it is scheduled in that cell.**

**Assisting serving HS-DSCH Cell: In addition to the serving HS-DSCH
cell, a cell in the same frequency, where the UE is configured to
simultaneously monitor a HS-SCCH set and receive HS-DSCH if it is
scheduled in that cell.**

**DL FET:** DL FET refers to early termination of DL DPCH transmission
upon receiving an acknowledgement message. In this context, a DL FET
ACK/NACK message represents an acknowledge message sent on UL DPCCH for
DL FET.

**DL\_DCH\_FET\_Config**: Higher layers signal this configuration
parameter to indicate enhanced DCH physical layer configuration. The
possible values are 0 and 1. The value 0 indicates Mode 0 configuration
where DL transport channels concatenation and DL FET ACK/NACK signalling
on UL are not configured. The value 1 indicates Mode 1 where DL
transport channel concatenation and DL FET ACK/NACK signalling on UL are
configured.

**HS-DSCH cell set:** A set of cells that can be configured together as
the serving and secondary serving HS-DSCH cells for a UE. This term is
applicable also to non-serving cells in an active set.

**MIMO mode:** This term refers to the downlink MIMO configuration with
two transmit antennas

**MIMO mode with four transmit antennas:** This term refers to the
downlink MIMO configuration with four transmit antennas

**Multiflow mode:** The UE is configured in Multiflow mode when it is
configured with an assisting serving HS-DSCH cell.

**Non-time reference cell:** An HS-DSCH cell configured for a UE in
Multiflow mode that has a different timing than the time reference cell.
If the time reference cell is the Assisting Serving HS-DSCH cell then
the non-time reference cell is the Serving HS-DSCH cell. If the time
reference cell is the Serving HS-DSCH Cell, then the non-time reference
cell is the Assisting Serving HS-DSCH cell.

**Time reference cell:** The (Serving or Assisting Serving, but not
Secondary Serving or Assisting Secondary Serving) HS-DSCH cell acting as
the time reference for the uplink HS-DPCCH when the UE is configured in
Multiflow mode. There is only one Time reference cell.

**UL DPCH 10ms Mode**: When configured by higher layers for the TTI to
be transmitted \[18\], UL DPCH follows physical channel procedures
specific to this mode. UL DPCH 10ms Mode can only happen when
DL\_DCH\_FET\_Config is configured.

**UL 20ms Compression Interval (CI):** A time interval of 20ms duration
aligned to a 20ms TTI defined for UL DPCH physical layer procedures when
DL\_DCH\_FET\_Config is configured by higher layers.

4 Services offered to higher layers
===================================

4.1 Transport channels
----------------------

Transport channels are services offered by Layer 1 to the higher layers.
General concepts about transport channels are described in \[12\].

A transport channel is defined by how and with what characteristics data
is transferred over the air interface. A general classification of
transport channels is into two groups:

\- Dedicated channels, using inherent addressing of UE;

\- Common channels, using explicit addressing of UE if addressing is
needed.

### 4.1.1 Dedicated transport channels

There exists two types of dedicated transport channel, the Dedicated
Channel (DCH) and the Enhanced Dedicated Channel (E-DCH).

#### 4.1.1.1 DCH - Dedicated Channel

The Dedicated Channel (DCH) is a downlink or uplink transport channel.
The DCH is transmitted over the entire cell or over only a part of the
cell using e.g. beam-forming antennas.

#### 4.1.1.2 E-DCH -- Enhanced Dedicated Channel

The Enhanced Dedicated Channel (E-DCH) is an uplink transport channel in
CELL DCH.

### 4.1.2 Common transport channels

There are six types of common transport channels: BCH, FACH, PCH, RACH,
HS-DSCH and E-DCH.

#### 4.1.2.1 BCH - Broadcast Channel

The Broadcast Channel (BCH) is a downlink transport channel that is used
to broadcast system- and cell-specific information. The BCH is always
transmitted over the entire cell and has a single non-zero transport
format. In cells configured with broadcast distribution, a first BCH
mapped to P-CCPCH is always present and one additional BCH mapped to
S-CCPCH can be configured.

#### 4.1.2.2 FACH - Forward Access Channel

The Forward Access Channel (FACH) is a downlink transport channel. The
FACH is transmitted over the entire cell. The FACH can be transmitted
using power setting described in \[16\].

#### 4.1.2.3 PCH - Paging Channel

The Paging Channel (PCH) is a downlink transport channel. The PCH is
always transmitted over the entire cell. The transmission of the PCH is
associated with the transmission of physical-layer generated Paging
Indicators, to support efficient sleep-mode procedures.

#### 4.1.2.4 RACH - Random Access Channel

The Random Access Channel (RACH) is an uplink transport channel. The
RACH is always received from the entire cell. The RACH is characterized
by a collision risk and by being transmitted using open loop power
control.

#### 4.1.2.5 Void

#### 4.1.2.6 Void

#### 4.1.2.7 HS-DSCH -- High Speed Downlink Shared Channel

The High Speed Downlink Shared Channel is a downlink transport channel
shared by several UEs. The HS-DSCH can be associated with one downlink
DPCH or F-DPCH, and one or several Shared Control Channels (HS-SCCH).
The HS-DSCH is transmitted over the entire cell or over only part of the
cell using e.g. beam-forming antennas.

#### 4.1.2.7A E-DCH - Enhanced Dedicated Channel

The Enhanced Dedicated Channel (E-DCH) is an uplink transport channel in
CELL\_FACH state and IDLE mode.

4.2 Indicators
--------------

Indicators are means of fast low-level signalling entities which are
transmitted without using information blocks sent over transport
channels. The meaning of indicators is specific to the type of
indicator.

The indicators defined in the current version of the specifications are:
Acquisition Indicator (AI), Page Indicator (PI) and MBMS Notification
Indicator (NI).

Indicators may be either boolean (two-valued) or three-valued. Their
mapping to indicator channels is channel specific.

Indicators are transmitted on those physical channels that are indicator
channels (ICH).

5 Physical channels and physical signals
========================================

Physical channels are defined by a specific carrier frequency,
scrambling code, channelization code (optional), time start & stop
(giving a duration) and, on the uplink, relative phase (0 or π/2). The
downlink E-HICH and E-RGCH are each further defined by a specific
orthogonal signature sequence. Scrambling and channelization codes are
specified in \[4\]. Time durations are defined by start and stop
instants, measured in integer multiples of chips. Suitable multiples of
chips also used in specification are:

> Radio frame: A radio frame is a processing duration which consists of
> 15 slots. The length of a radio frame corresponds to 38400 chips.
>
> Slot: A slot is a duration which consists of fields containing bits.
> The length of a slot corresponds to 2560 chips.
>
> Sub-frame: A sub-frame is the basic time interval for E-DCH and
> HS-DSCH transmission and E-DCH and HS-DSCH-related signalling at the
> physical layer. The length of a sub-frame corresponds to 3 slots (7680
> chips).

The default time duration for a physical channel is continuous from the
instant when it is started to the instant when it is stopped. Physical
channels that are not continuous will be explicitly described.

Transport channels are described (in more abstract higher layer models
of the physical layer) as being capable of being mapped to physical
channels. Within the physical layer itself the exact mapping is from a
composite coded transport channel (CCTrCH) to the data part of a
physical channel. In addition to data parts there also exist channel
control parts and physical signals.

5.1 Physical signals
--------------------

Physical signals are entities with the same basic on-air attributes as
physical channels but do not have transport channels or indicators
mapped to them. Physical signals may be associated with physical
channels in order to support the function of physical channels.

5.2 Uplink physical channels
----------------------------

### 5.2.1 Dedicated uplink physical channels

There are seven types of uplink dedicated physical channels, the uplink
Dedicated Physical Data Channel (uplink DPDCH), the uplink Dedicated
Physical Control Channel (uplink DPCCH), the uplink Secondary Dedicated
Physical Control Channel (uplink S-DPCCH), the uplink Dedicated Physical
Control Channel 2 (uplink DPCCH2), the uplink E-DCH Dedicated Physical
Data Channel (uplink E-DPDCH), the uplink E-DCH Dedicated Physical
Control Channel (uplink E-DPCCH) and the uplink Dedicated Control
Channel associated with HS-DSCH transmission (uplink HS-DPCCH).

The DPDCH, the DPCCH, the DPCCH2, the S-DPCCH, the E-DPDCH, the E-DPCCH
and the HS-DPCCH are I/Q code multiplexed (see \[4\]).

#### 5.2.1.1 DPCCH, DPCCH2, S-DPCCH and DPDCH

The uplink DPDCH is used to carry the DCH transport channel. There may
be zero, one, or several uplink DPDCHs on each radio link.

The uplink DPCCH is used to carry control information generated at Layer
1. The Layer 1 control information consists of known pilot bits to
support channel estimation for coherent detection, transmit
power-control (TPC) commands, feedback information (FBI), and an
optional transport-format combination indicator (TFCI). The
transport-format combination indicator informs the receiver about the
instantaneous transport format combination of the transport channels
mapped to the simultaneously transmitted uplink DPDCH radio frame. There
is one and only one uplink DPCCH on each radio link. The uplink DPCCH
may also carry DL FET ACK/NACK signalling information for DL FET
operation when DL\_DCH\_FET\_Config = 1.

The uplink DPCCH2 is used to carry control information generated at
Layer 1. The Layer 1 control information consists of known pilot bits to
support channel estimation for coherent detection, and transmit
power-control (TPC) commands. When DPCCH2 is configured there is one and
only one uplink DPCCH2 for all radio links. When DPCCH2 is configured,
the UE shall transmit DPCCH2 only in the slots in which DPCCH is
transmitted.

The uplink S-DPCCH is used to carry control information generated at
Layer 1. The Layer 1 control information consists of known pilot bits to
support channel sounding and channel estimation for coherent detection.
There is up to one uplink S-DPCCH on each radio link in the case that
UL\_CLTD\_Enabled as defined in \[5\] is TRUE. Figure 1 shows the frame
structure of the uplink DPDCH, the uplink DPCCH, the uplink DPCCH2 and
the uplink S-DPCCH. Each radio frame of length 10 ms is split into 5
subframes, each of 3 slots, each of length T~slot~ = 2560 chips,
corresponding to one power-control period. The DPDCH, DPCCH, S-DPCCH and
DPCCH2 are always frame aligned with each other.

Figure 1: Frame structure for uplink DPDCH/DPCCH/S-DPCCH/DPCCH2

The parameter k in figure 1 determines the number of bits per uplink
DPDCH slot. It is related to the spreading factor SF of the DPDCH as SF
= 256/2^k^. The DPDCH spreading factor may range from 256 down to 4. The
spreading factor of the uplink DPCCH, the uplink DPCCH2 and the uplink
S-DPCCH is always equal to 256, i.e. there are 10 bits per uplink
DPCCH/S-DPCCH/DPCCH2 slot.

The exact number of bits of the uplink DPDCH and the different uplink
DPCCH fields (N~pilot~, N~TFCI~, N~FBI~, and N~TPC~) is given by table 1
and table 2. What slot format to use is configured by higher layers and
can also be reconfigured by higher layers. The exact number of bits of
the uplink S-DPCCH is given by table 2A.

The uplink DPCCH2 reuses slot format \#1 of DPCCH, and the exact number
of bits is given in table 2.

The channel bit and symbol rates given in table 1, table 2 and table 2A
are the rates immediately before spreading. The pilot patterns are given
in table 3 and table 4, the TPC bit pattern is given in table 5.

The FBI bits are used to support techniques requiring feedback from the
UE to the UTRAN Access Point for operation of closed loop mode transmit
diversity. The use of the FBI bits is described in detail in \[5\].

There are two types of uplink dedicated physical channels; those that
include TFCI (e.g. for several simultaneous services) and those that do
not include TFCI (e.g. for fixed-rate services). These types are
reflected by the duplicated rows of table 2. It is the UTRAN that
determines if a TFCI should be transmitted and it is mandatory for all
UEs to support the use of TFCI in the uplink. The mapping of TFCI bits
onto slots is described in \[3\].

DPCCH slot format 5 is used when DL\_DCH\_FET\_Config is configured by
higher layers. In this case, over a 20ms Compression Interval (CI)
consisting of 30 slots, the bits in the TFCI field carry TFCI
information in the first 10 slots, and may carry an ACK/NACK indicator
for DL FET in the remaining 20 slots. The ACK/NACK for DL FET is sent
when DL\_DCH\_FET\_Config = 1.

In compressed mode, DPCCH slot formats with TFCI fields are changed.
There are two possible compressed slot formats for normal slot formats 0
and 2. They are labelled A and B and the selection between them is
dependent on the number of slots that are transmitted in each frame in
compressed mode. When DL\_DCH\_FET\_Config is configured by higher
layers, UL DPCCH slot format 5 is used in compressed mode. In compressed
mode when UL\_DCH\_FET\_Config is configured by higher layers, TFCI bits
represent TFCI information in the first 10 slots that are not in
compressed-mode gaps in a 20ms CI. The TFCI bits in subsequent slots
that are not in the compressed mode gaps represent ACK/NACK indication
for DL FET when DL\_DCH\_FET\_Config = 1.

If UL\_DTX\_Active is TRUE (see \[5\]), the number of transmitted slots
per radio frame may be less than the number shown in Table 2 and Table
2A.

^\*^ NOTE: In a 20ms CI of 30 slots, TFCI bits represent TFCI
information in the first 10 slots and may represent DL FET ACK/NACK
indication for DL FET in the remaining slots. Slot format 5 is also used
in compressed mode for UL DPCCH.

The pilot bit pattern for S-DPCCH is the same as that for uplink DPCCH
with N~pilot~ = 8. The N~fixed~ bits in the S-DPCCH are fixed to \"10\".

The pilot bit pattern for DPCCH2 is the same as that for uplink DPCCH
with N~pilot~ = 8.

The pilot bit patterns are described in table 3 and table 4. The
shadowed column part of pilot bit pattern is defined as FSW and FSWs can
be used to confirm frame synchronization. (The value of the pilot bit
pattern other than FSWs shall be \"1\".)

The relationship between the TPC bit pattern and transmitter power
control command is presented in table 5.

Table 5: TPC Bit Pattern

+-----------------+-----------------------------------+---+
| TPC Bit Pattern | Transmitter power control command |   |

Multi-code operation is possible for the uplink dedicated physical
channels. When multi-code transmission is used, several parallel DPDCH
are transmitted using different channelization codes, see \[4\].
However, there is only one DPCCH per radio link, one DPCCH2 if DPCCH2 is
configured and up to one S-DPCCH in the case that UL\_CLTD\_Enable is
TRUE.

A period of uplink DPCCH transmission prior to the start of the uplink
DPDCH transmission (uplink DPCCH power control preamble) shall be used
for initialisation of a DCH. The length of the power control preamble is
a higher layer parameter, N~pcp~ , signalled by the network \[5\]. The
UL DPCCH shall take the same slot format in the power control preamble
as afterwards, as given in table 2. When N~pcp~ \> 0 the pilot patterns
of table 3 and table 4 shall be used. The timing of the power control
preamble is described in \[5\], subclause 4.3.2.3. The TFCI field is
filled with \"0\" bits.

#### 5.2.1.2 HS-DPCCH

Figure 2A illustrates the frame structure of the HS-DPCCH. The HS-DPCCH
carries uplink feedback signalling related to downlink HS-DSCH
transmission and to HS-SCCH orders according to subclause 6A.1.1 in
\[5\]. The feedback signalling consists of Hybrid-ARQ Acknowledgement
(HARQ-ACK) and Channel-Quality Indication (CQI), in case the UE is
configured in MIMO mode or in MIMO mode with four transmit antennas
Precoding Control Indication (PCI) as well and in case the UE is
configured in MIMO mode with four transmit antennas the number of
transport blocks preferred (NTBP) as well \[*3*\]. Each sub frame of
length 2 ms (3\*2560 chips) consists of 3 slots, each of length 2560
chips. The HARQ-ACK is carried in the first slot of the HS-DPCCH
sub-frame. The CQI, in case the UE is configured in MIMO mode also the
PCI, and in case the UE is configured in MIMO mode with four transmit
antennas also the PCI and the number of UE preferred transport blocks
are carried in the second and third slot of a HS-DPCCH sub-frame. There
is at most one HS-DPCCH on each radio link if Secondary\_Cell\_Enabled
as defined in \[5\] is less than 4 in case the UE is not configured in
MIMO mode with four transmit antennas, 2 in case the UE is configured in
MIMO mode with four transmit antennas and at most two HS-DPCCHs
otherwise. If DPCCH2 is not configured, the HS-DPCCH(s) can only exist
together with an uplink DPCCH. If DPCCH2 is configured, the HS-DPCCH(s)
can only exist together with an uplink DPCCH2. The timing of the
HS-DPCCH relative to the uplink DPCCH is shown in section 7.7 for the
case where one HS-DPCCH exists. In the case where two HS-DPCCH exist,
both HS-DPCCHs have identical timing.

The slot formats for uplink HS-DPCCH are defined in Table 5A.

#### 5.2.1.3 E-DPCCH and E-DPDCH

The E-DPDCH is used to carry the E-DCH transport channel. There may be
zero, one, or several E-DPDCH on each radio link.

The E-DPCCH is a physical channel used to transmit control information
associated with the E-DCH. There is at most one E-DPCCH on each radio
link.

E-DPDCH and E-DPCCH are always transmitted simultaneously, except for
the following cases when E-DPCCH is transmitted without E-DPDCH:

\- when E-DPDCH but not E-DPCCH is DTXed due to power scaling as
described in \[5\] section 5.1.2.6, or

\- during the *n~dtx~* E‑DPDCH idle slots if *n~max~*\>*n~tx1~* as
described in \[3\] section 4.4.5.2.

E-DPCCH shall not be transmitted in a slot unless DPCCH is also
transmitted in the same slot.

Figure 2B shows the E-DPDCH and E-DPCCH (sub)frame structure. Each radio
frame is divided in 5 subframes, each of length 2 ms; the first subframe
starts at the start of each radio frame and the 5^th^ subframe ends at
the end of each radio frame.

An E-DPDCH may use BPSK, 4PAM or 8PAM modulation symbols. In figure 2B,
M is the number of bits per modulation symbol i.e. M=1 for BPSK, M=2 for
4PAM and M=3 for 8PAM.

The E-DPDCH slot formats, corresponding rates and number of bits are
specified in Table 5B. The E-DPCCH slot format is listed in Table 5C.

#### 5.2.1.3A S-E-DPCCH and S-E-DPDCH

The S-E-DPDCH is used to carry the E-DCH transport channel. When
UL\_MIMO\_Enabled is set to TRUE and rank-2 transmission takes place on
a radio link, the number of S-E-DPDCH channels on that radio link is 4,
otherwise, it is zero.

The S-E-DPCCH is a physical channel used to transmit control information
associated with the S-E-DPDCH. There is at most one S-E-DPCCH on each
radio link.

S-E-DPDCH and S-E-DPCCH are always transmitted simultaneously.

S-E-DPCCH shall not be transmitted in a slot unless DPCCH and S-DPCCH is
also transmitted in the same slot.

The S-E-DPDCH frame structure is the same as the E-DPDCH frame
structure. The S-E-DPCCH frame structure is the same as the E-DPCCH
frame structure.

An S-E-DPDCH may use BPSK, 4PAM or 8PAM modulation symbols.

The S-E-DPDCH slot formats, corresponding rates and number of bits are
as specified for slot formats 6-11 in table 5B for E­-DPDCH. Slot
formats 0-5 are not applicable for S-E-DPDCH.

The S-E-DPCCH slot format is as specified for E-DPCCH in Table 5C.

### 5.2.2 Common uplink physical channels

#### 5.2.2.1 Physical Random Access Channel (PRACH)

The Physical Random Access Channel (PRACH) is used to carry the RACH.

##### 5.2.2.1.1 Overall structure of random-access transmission 

The random-access transmission is based on a Slotted ALOHA approach with
fast acquisition indication. The UE can start the random-access
transmission at the beginning of a number of well-defined time
intervals, denoted *access slots.* There are 15 access slots per two
frames and they are spaced 5120 chips apart, see figure 3. The timing of
the access slots and the acquisition indication is described in
subclause 7.3. Information on what access slots are available for
random-access transmission is given by higher layers.

height="2.908333333333333in"}

Figure 3: RACH access slot numbers and their spacing

The structure of the random-access transmission is shown in figure 4.
The random-access transmission consists of one or several *preambles* of
length 4096 chips and a *message* of length 10 ms or 20 ms.

height="1.6368055555555556in"}

Figure 4: Structure of the random-access transmission

##### 5.2.2.1.2 RACH preamble part

Each preamble is of length 4096 chips and consists of 256 repetitions of
a signature of length 16 chips. There are a maximum of 16 available
signatures, see \[4\] for more details.

##### 5.2.2.1.3 RACH message part

Figure 5 shows the structure of the random-access message part radio
frame. The 10 ms message part radio frame is split into 15 slots, each
of length T~slot~ = 2560 chips. Each slot consists of two parts, a data
part to which the RACH transport channel is mapped and a control part
that carries Layer 1 control information. The data and control parts are
transmitted in parallel. A 10 ms message part consists of one message
part radio frame, while a 20 ms message part consists of two consecutive
10 ms message part radio frames. The message part length is equal to the
Transmission Time Interval of the RACH Transport channel in use. This
TTI length is configured by higher layers.

The data part consists of 10\*2^k^ bits, where k=0,1,2,3. This
corresponds to a spreading factor of 256, 128, 64, and 32 respectively
for the message data part.

The control part consists of 8 known pilot bits to support channel
estimation for coherent detection and 2 TFCI bits. This corresponds to a
spreading factor of 256 for the message control part. The pilot bit
pattern is described in table 8. The total number of TFCI bits in the
random-access message is 15\*2 = 30. The TFCI of a radio frame indicates
the transport format of the RACH transport channel mapped to the
simultaneously transmitted message part radio frame. In case of a 20 ms
PRACH message part, the TFCI is repeated in the second radio frame.

5.3 Downlink physical channels
------------------------------

### 5.3.1 Downlink transmit diversity

Table 10 summarises the possible application of open and closed loop
transmit diversity modes on different downlink physical channel types.
Simultaneous use of STTD and closed loop modes on the same physical
channel is not allowed. In addition, if Tx diversity is applied on any
of the downlink physical channels allocated to a UE(s) that is
configured to use P-CPICH as a phase reference on both antennas, then Tx
diversity shall also be applied on P-CCPCH and SCH. If Tx diversity is
applied on SCH it shall also be applied on P-CCPCH and vice versa.
Regarding CPICH transmission in case of transmit diversity used on SCH
and P-CCPCH, see subclause 5.3.3.1. An S-CCPCH carrying BCH shall be
transmitted with the same diversity mode as P-CCPCH.

With respect to the usage of Tx diversity for DPCH or F-DPCH on
different radio links within an active set, the following rules apply:

\- Different Tx diversity modes (STTD and closed loop) shall not be used
on the radio links within one active set.

\- No Tx diversity on one or more radio links shall not prevent UTRAN to
use Tx diversity on other radio links within the same active set.

\- If STTD is activated on one or several radio links in the active set,
the UE shall operate STTD on only those radio links where STTD has been
activated. Higher layers inform the UE about the usage of STTD on the
individual radio links in the active set.

\- Regarding the usage of Tx diversity for DPCH on different radio links
within an active set, if closed loop TX diversity is activated on one or
several radio links in the active set, the UE shall operate closed loop
TX diversity on only those radio links where closed loop TX diversity
has been activated. Higher layers inform the UE about the usage of
closed loop TX diversity on the individual radio links in the active
set.

Furthermore, if the UE is not configured in MIMO mode and in MIMO mode
with four transmit antennas in a cell the following restrictions apply
in this cell:

\- If a DPCH is associated with an HS-PDSCH subframe in the same cell,
the transmit diversity mode used for the HS-PDSCH subframe shall be the
same as the transmit diversity mode used for the DPCH associated with
this HS-PDSCH subframe.

\- If an F-DPCH is associated with an HS-PDSCH subframe in the same
cell, the transmit diversity mode used for the HS-PDSCH subframe shall
be the same as the transmit diversity mode signalled for the F-DPCH
associated with this HS-PDSCH subframe.

\- If neither DPCH nor F-DPCH is associated with an HS-PDSCH subframe
the transmit diversity mode used for the HS-PDSCH subframe shall be the
STTD if the P-CCPCH in the cell is using transmit diversity. Otherwise,
no transmit diversity is used for the HS-PDSCH subframe.

\- If the UE is configured with a secondary serving HS-DSCH cell not
associated with either DPCH or F-DPCH in the same cell, the diversity
mode used for the HS-PDSCH subframe of that cell is configured by higher
layers and independent from that used in the serving HS-DSCH cell.

If the UE is configured in MIMO mode in a cell then a DPCH or F-DPCH
associated with an HS-PDSCH subframe can be either in transmit diversity
mode or in no transmit diversity mode in this cell.

Regardless of whether or not the UE is configured in MIMO mode or in
MIMO mode with four transmit antennas in a cell,

\- If the DPCH associated with an HS-SCCH subframe in the same cell is
using either open or closed loop transmit diversity on the radio link
transmitted from the HS-DSCH serving cell, the HS-SCCH subframe from
this cell shall be transmitted using STTD, otherwise no transmit
diversity shall be used for this HS-SCCH subframe.

\- If an F-DPCH for which STTD is signalled is associated with an
HS-SCCH subframe in the same cell, the HS-SCCH subframe shall be
transmitted using STTD, otherwise no transmit diversity shall be used
for this HS-SCCH subframe.

\- If neither DPCH nor F-DPCH is associated with an HS-SCCH subframe the
transmit diversity mode used for the HS-SCCH subframe shall be the STTD
if the P-CCPCH in the cell is using transmit diversity. Otherwise, no
transmit diversity is used for the HS-SCCH subframe.

\- If the UE is configured with a secondary serving HS-DSCH cell not
associated with either DPCH or F-DPCH in the same cell, the diversity
mode used for the HS-SCCH subframe of that cell is configured by higher
layers and independent from that used in the serving HS-DSCH cell.

\- If DPCCH2 is configured and if more than one F-DPCH is transmitted in
the same cell, then the transmit diversity mode is the same for all the
F-DPCHs. If DPCCH2 is configured and if both DPCH and F-DPCH are
transmitted in the same cell, then the transmit diversity modes for the
DPCH and F-DPCH can be configured independently.

The transmit diversity mode on the associated DPCH or F-DPCH may not
change during a HS-SCCH and or HS-PDSCH subframe and within the slot
prior to the HS-SCCH subframe. This includes any change between no Tx
diversity and either open loop or closed loop mode.

If the UE is receiving a DPCH on which transmit diversity is used from a
cell, or if the UE is receiving an F-DPCH for which STTD is signalled
from a cell, the UE shall assume that the E-AGCH, E-ROCH, E-RGCH,
E-HICH, and F-TPICH from the same cell are transmitted using STTD.

If DPCCH2 is configured and if the UE is receiving both DPCH and F-DPCH
from a cell, then the UE shall assume that the E-AGCH, E-ROCH, E-RGCH,
E-HICH, and F-TPICH from the same cell are transmitted using the
transmit diversity mode signalled for the F-DPCH.

#### 5.3.1.1 Open loop transmit diversity

##### 5.3.1.1.1 Space time block coding based transmit antenna diversity (STTD)

The open loop downlink transmit diversity employs a space time block
coding based transmit diversity (STTD).

The STTD encoding is optional in UTRAN. STTD support is mandatory at the
UE.

A block diagram of a generic STTD encoder is shown in the figure 8,
figure 8A and figure 8B below. Channel coding, rate matching and
interleaving are done as in the non-diversity mode. For QPSK, the STTD
encoder operates on 4 symbols *b~0~*, *b~1~*, *b~2~*, *b~3~* as shown in
figure 8. For AICH, E-RGCH, E-HICH the $b_{i}$ are real valued signals,
and $\overline{b_{i}}$is defined as $- b_{i}$. For channels other than
AICH, E-RGCH, E-HICH the $b_{i}$ are 3-valued digits, taking the values
0, 1, \"DTX\", and $\overline{b_{i}}$is defined as follows: if $b_{i}$ =
0 then $\overline{b_{i}}$= 1, if $b_{i}$ = 1 then $\overline{b_{i}}$= 0,
otherwise $\overline{b_{i}}$ = $b_{i}$.

Figure 8: Generic block diagram of the STTD encoder for QPSK

For 16QAM, STTD operates on blocks of 8 consecutive symbols b~0~, b~1~,
b~2~, b~3~, b~4~, b~5~, b~6~, b~7~ as shown in figure 8A below.

Figure 8A: Generic block diagram of the STTD encoder for 16QAM

For 64QAM, STTD operates on blocks of 12 consecutive symbols b~0~, b~1~,
b~2~, b~3~, b~4~, b~5~, b~6~, b~7~, b~8~, b~9~, b~10~, b~11~ as shown in
figure 8B below.

##### 5.3.1.1.2 Time Switched Transmit Diversity for SCH (TSTD)

Transmit diversity, in the form of Time Switched Transmit Diversity
(TSTD), can be applied to the SCH. TSTD for the SCH is optional in
UTRAN, while TSTD support is mandatory in the UE. TSTD for the SCH is
described in subclause 5.3.3.5.1.

#### 5.3.1.2 Closed loop transmit diversity

Closed loop transmit diversity is described in \[5\]. Closed loop
transmit diversity mode 1 shall be supported at the UE and may be
supported in the UTRAN.

### 5.3.2 Dedicated downlink physical channels

There are five types of downlink dedicated physical channels, the
Downlink Dedicated Physical Channel (downlink DPCH), the Fractional
Dedicated Physical Channel (F-DPCH), the E-DCH Relative Grant Channel
(E-RGCH), the E-DCH Hybrid ARQ Indicator Channel (E-HICH), and the
Fractional Transmitted Precoding Indicator Channel (F-TPICH).

The F-DPCH is described in subclause 5.3.2.6.

Within one downlink DPCH, dedicated data generated at Layer 2 and above,
i.e. the dedicated transport channel (DCH), is transmitted in
time-multiplex with control information generated at Layer 1 (known
pilot bits, TPC commands, and an optional TFCI). The downlink DPCH can
thus be seen as a time multiplex of a downlink DPDCH and a downlink
DPCCH, compare subclause 5.2.1.

Figure 9 shows the frame structure of the downlink DPCH. Each frame of
length 10 ms is split into 15 slots, each of length T~slot~ = 2560
chips, corresponding to one power-control period.

![](media/image11.wmf){width="5.072916666666667in"
height="2.1569444444444446in"}

Figure 9: Frame structure for downlink DPCH

The parameter k in figure 9 determines the total number of bits per
downlink DPCH slot. It is related to the spreading factor SF of the
physical channel as SF = 512/2^k^. The spreading factor may thus range
from 512 down to 4.

The exact number of bits of the different downlink DPCH fields
(N~pilot~, N~TPC~, N~TFCI~, N~data1~ and N~data2~) is given in table 11.
What slot format to use is configured by higher layers and can also be
reconfigured by higher layers.

There are basically two types of downlink Dedicated Physical Channels;
those that include TFCI (e.g. for several simultaneous services) and
those that do not include TFCI (e.g. for fixed-rate services). These
types are reflected by the duplicated rows of table 11. It is the UTRAN
that determines if a TFCI should be transmitted and it is mandatory for
all UEs to support the use of TFCI in the downlink. The mapping of TFCI
bits onto slots is described in \[3\].

In compressed frames, a different slot format is used compared to normal
mode. There are two possible compressed slot formats that are labelled A
and B. Slot format B shall be used in frames compressed by spreading
factor reduction and slot format A shall be used in frames compressed by
higher layer scheduling. The channel bit and symbol rates given in table
11 are the rates immediately before spreading.

\* If TFCI bits are not used, then DTX shall be used in TFCI field.

NOTE 1: Compressed mode is only supported through spreading factor
reduction for SF=512 with TFCI.

NOTE 2: Compressed mode by spreading factor reduction is not supported
for SF=4.

NOTE 3: If the Node B receives an invalid combination of data frames for
downlink transmission, the procedure specified in \[15\], sub-clause
5.1.2, may require the use of DTX in both the DPDCH and the TFCI field
of the DPCCH.

NOTE 4: Slot formats 17 and 18 are only used when DL\_DCH\_FET\_Config
is configured by higher layers.

The pilot bit patterns are described in table 12. The shadowed column
part of pilot bit pattern is defined as FSW and FSWs can be used to
confirm frame synchronization. (The value of the pilot bit pattern other
than FSWs shall be \"11\".) In table 12, the transmission order is from
left to right.

In downlink compressed mode through spreading factor reduction, the
number of bits in the TPC and Pilot fields are doubled. Symbol
repetition is used to fill up the fields. Denote the bits in one of
these fields in normal mode by *x*~1~, *x*~2~, *x*~3~, ..., *x~X~*. In
compressed mode the following bit sequence is sent in corresponding
field: *x*~1~, *x*~2~, *x*~1~, *x*~2~, *x*~3~, *x*~4~, *x*~3~,
*x*~4~,..., *x~X,~*.

Multicode transmission may be employed in the downlink, i.e. the CCTrCH
(see \[3\]) is mapped onto several parallel downlink DPCHs using the
same spreading factor. In this case, the Layer 1 control information is
transmitted only on the first downlink DPCH. DTX bits are transmitted
during the corresponding time period for the additional downlink DPCHs,
see figure 10.

In case there are several CCTrCHs mapped to different DPCHs transmitted
to the same UE different spreading factors can be used on DPCHs to which
different CCTrCHs are mapped. Also in this case, Layer 1 control
information is only transmitted on the first DPCH while DTX bits are
transmitted during the corresponding time period for the additional
DPCHs.

Note : support of multiple CCTrChs of dedicated type is not part of the
current release.

#### 5.3.2.1 STTD for DPCH, F-DPCH and F-TPICH

The pilot bit pattern for the DPCH channel transmitted on antenna 2 is
given in table 14.

\- For N~pilot~ = 8, 16 the shadowed part indicates pilot bits that are
obtained by STTD encoding the corresponding (shadowed) bits in Table 12.
The non-shadowed pilot bit pattern is orthogonal to the corresponding
(non-shadowed) pilot bit pattern in table 12.

\- For N~pilot~ = 4, the diversity antenna pilot bit pattern is obtained
by STTD encoding both the shadowed and non-shadowed pilot bits in table
12.

\- For N~pilot~ = 2, the diversity antenna pilot pattern is obtained by
STTD encoding the two pilot bits in table 12 with the last two bits
(data or DTX) of the second data field (data2) of the slot. Thus for
N~pilot~ = 2 case, the last two bits of the second data field (data 2)
after STTD encoding, follow the diversity antenna pilot bits in Table
14.

\- For N~pilot~ = 0, transmit diversity is not used.

STTD encoding for the DPDCH, TPC, and TFCI fields is done as described
in subclause 5.3.1.1.1. For the SF=512 DPCH, the first two bits in each
slot, i.e. TPC bits, are not STTD encoded and the same bits are
transmitted with equal power from the two antennas. The remaining four
bits are STTD encoded.

For F-DPCH, the TPC bits are not STTD encoded and the same bits are
transmitted with equal power from the two antennas.

For F-TPICH, the TPI bits are not STTD encoded and the same bits are
transmitted with equal power from the two antennas.

For compressed mode through spreading factor reduction and for N~pilot~
\> 4, symbol repetition shall be applied to the pilot bit patterns of
table 14, in the same manner as described in 5.3.2. For slot formats 2B
and 3B, i.e. compressed mode through spreading factor reduction and
N~pilot~ = 4, the pilot bits transmitted on antenna 2 are STTD encoded,
and thus the pilot bit pattern is as shown in the most right set of
table 14.

#### 5.3.2.3 Void

#### 5.3.2.4 E-DCH Relative Grant Channel

An E-DCH Relative Grant Channel (E-RGCH) is a fixed rate (SF=128)
dedicated downlink physical channel carrying the uplink E-DCH relative
grants for one uplink E-DCH associated with the E-RGCH by higher layer
signalling. Figure 12A illustrates the structure of the E-RGCH. A
relative grant is transmitted using 3, 12 or 15 consecutive slots and in
each slot a sequence of 40 ternary values is transmitted. The 3 and 12
slot duration shall be used on an E-RGCH transmitted to UEs for which
the cell transmitting the E-RGCH is in the E-DCH serving radio link set
and for which the E-DCH TTI is respectively 2 and 10 ms. The 15 slot
duration shall be used on an E-RGCH transmitted to UEs for which the
cell transmitting the E-RGCH is not in the E-DCH serving radio link set.

The sequence b~i,0~, b~i,1~, ..., b~i,39~ transmitted in slot i in
Figure 12A is given by b~i,j~ = a C~ss,40,m(i),j~. In a serving E-DCH
radio link set, the relative grant a is set to +1, 0, or -1 and in a
radio link not belonging to the serving E-DCH radio link set, the
relative grant a is set to 0 or -1. The orthogonal signature sequences
C~ss,40,\ m(i)~ is given by Table 16A and the index m(i) in slot i is
given by Table 16B. The E-RGCH signature sequence index l in Table 16B
is given by higher layers.

In case STTD-based open loop transmit diversity is applied for E-RGCH,
STTD encoding according to subclause 5.3.1.1.1 is applied to the
sequence b~i,j~.

#### 5.3.2.5 E-DCH Hybrid ARQ Indicator Channel

An E-DCH Hybrid ARQ Indicator Channel (E-HICH) is a fixed rate (SF=128)
dedicated downlink physical channel carrying the uplink E-DCH hybrid ARQ
acknowledgement indicator for one uplink E-DCH.

The uplink E-DCH is associated with the E-HICH signature sequence(s)
provided by higher layer signalling. Figure 12A illustrates the
structure of the E-HICH. A hybrid ARQ acknowledgement indicator is
transmitted using 3 or 12 consecutive slots and in each slot a sequence
of 40 binary values is transmitted. The 3 and 12 slot duration shall be
used for UEs which E-DCH TTI is set to respectively 2 ms and 10 ms.

The sequence b~i,0~, b~i,1~, ..., b~i,39~ transmitted in slot i in
Figure 12A is given by b~i,j~ = a C~ss,40,\ m(i),j~. In a radio link set
containing the serving E-DCH radio link set, the hybrid ARQ
acknowledgement indicator a is set to +1 or --1, and in a radio link set
not containing the serving E-DCH radio link set the hybrid ARQ indicator
a is set to +1 or 0. The orthogonal signature sequences C~ss,40,m(i)~ is
given by Table 16A and the index m(i) in slot i is given by Table 16B.
The E-HICH signature sequence index l is given by higher layers.

In case STTD-based open loop transmit diversity is applied for E-HICH,
STTD encoding according to subclause 5.3.1.1.1 is applied to the
sequence b~i,j~

If UL\_MIMO\_Enabled is TRUE, the UE is configured with a second E-HICH
signature sequence associated with HARQ acknowledgments for the
transport block transmitted on S-E-DPDCHs.

#### 5.3.2.6 Fractional Dedicated Physical Channel (F-DPCH)

An F-DPCH carries control information generated at layer 1 (TPC
commands) for one uplink DPCCH associated with the F-DPCH by higher
layer signalling. It is a special case of downlink DPCCH.

If DPCCH2 is configured, an additional F-DPCH carries control
information generated at layer 1 (TPC commands) for one uplink DPCCH2
associated with the F-DPCH by higher layer signalling.

Figure 12B shows the frame structure of the F-DPCH. Each frame of length
10ms is split into 15 slots, each of length T~slot~ = 2560 chips,
corresponding to one power-control period.

Figure 12B: Frame structure for F-DPCH

The exact number of bits of the OFF periods and of the F-DPCH fields
(N~TPC~) is described in table 16C. Each slot format corresponds to a
different set of OFF periods within the F-DPCH slot.

If DPCCH2 is configured, the slot format of F-DPCH associated with the
DPCCH shall be different from the slot format of F-DPCH associated with
the DPCCH2.

In compressed frames, F-DPCH is not transmitted in downlink transmission
gaps given by transmission gap pattern sequences signalled by higher
layers.

The relationship between the TPC symbol and the transmitter power
control command is according to table 13.

#### 5.3.2.7 Fractional Transmitted Precoding Indicator Channel (F-TPICH)

An F-TPICH carries transmitted precoding indicator generated at layer 1
for uplink CLTD operation.

Figure 12C shows the frame structure of the F-TPICH. Each frame of
length 10ms is split into 15 slots, each of length T~slot~ = 2560 chips.
A TPI is transmitted using the first two consecutive slots within one
subframe, and in each slot one symbol is transmitted using the same slot
format.

Figure 12C: Frame structure for F-TPICH

The exact number of bits of the OFF periods and of the F-TPICH fields
(N~TPI~) is described in table 16D. Each slot format corresponds to a
different set of OFF periods within the F-TPICH slot.

The relationship between TPI and bit pattern on F-TPICH is defined in
\[5\].

*For a given UE, the TPI feedback bits are not transmitted on F-TPICH
bits that overlap with the TPC bits on the F-DPCH channel.*

In compressed frames, if one of the two slots corresponding to the TPI
indication overlaps with the downlink transmission gaps given by
transmission gap pattern sequences signalled by higher layers, neither
of the slots is transmitted.

### 5.3.3 Common downlink physical channels

#### 5.3.3.1 Common Pilot Channel (CPICH)

The CPICH is a fixed rate (30 kbps, SF=256) downlink physical channel
that carries a pre-defined bit sequence. Figure 13 shows the frame
structure of the CPICH.

Figure 13: Frame structure for Common Pilot Channel

In case transmit diversity is used on P-CCPCH and SCH, the CPICH shall
be transmitted from both antennas using the same channelization and
scrambling code. In this case, the pre-defined bit sequence of the CPICH
is different for Antenna 1 and Antenna 2, see figure 14. In case of no
transmit diversity, the bit sequence of Antenna 1 in figure 14 is used.

Figure 14: Modulation pattern for Common Pilot Channel

There are two types of Common pilot channels, the Primary and Secondary
CPICH. They differ in their use and the limitations placed on their
physical features.

##### 5.3.3.1.1 Primary Common Pilot Channel (P-CPICH)

The Primary Common Pilot Channel (P-CPICH) has the following
characteristics:

\- The same channelization code is always used for the P-CPICH, see
\[4\];

\- The P-CPICH is scrambled by the primary scrambling code, see \[4\];

\- There is one and only one P-CPICH per cell;

\- The P-CPICH is broadcast over the entire cell.

##### 5.3.3.1.2 Secondary Common Pilot Channel (S-CPICH)

A Secondary Common Pilot Channel (S-CPICH) has the following
characteristics:

\- An arbitrary channelization code of SF=256 is used for the S-CPICH,
see \[4\];

\- An S-CPICH is scrambled by either the primary or a secondary
scrambling code, see \[4\];

\- There may be zero, one, or several S-CPICH per cell;

\- An S-CPICH may be transmitted over the entire cell or only over a
part of the cell;

\- An S-CPICH that is intended to be used as phase reference for the
second, third or fourth transmit antenna by UEs configured in MIMO mode
or in MIMO mode with four transmit antennas shall be transmitted over
the entire cell using the primary scrambling code and the antenna 1
pattern.

##### 5.3.3.1.3 Demodulation Common Pilot Channel (D-CPICH)

A Demodulation Common Pilot Channel (D-CPICH) has the following
characteristics:

\- An arbitrary channelization code of SF=256 is used for the D-CPICH,
see \[4\];

\- A D-CPICH is scrambled by the primary scrambling code see \[4\];

\- There may be zero or two D-CPICH per cell;

\- A D-CPICH shall be transmitted over the entire cell;

\- Carries a pre defined bit sequence same as that of Antenna 1 in
Figure 14;

\- A D-CPICH is non precoded and is transmitted from third or fourth
transmit antenna;

\- The UE for which the two D-CPICH are activated may assume that the
D-CPICHs are present in the HS-DSCH TTIs in which the UE is scheduled to
receive HS-PDSCHs.

#### 5.3.3.2 Downlink phase reference

Table 17 specifies the channels which the UE may use as a phase
reference for each downlink physical channel type in a cell; it also
specifies whether the channels which the UE may use as a phase reference
for a channel of a particular type shall be assumed to be the same as
the ones which the UE may use as a phase reference for the associated
DPCH or F-DPCH in the same cell, if configured.

For the DPCH or F-DPCH and the associated downlink physical channels the
following always applies:

\- The UE may use the DPCH pilot bits as a phase reference.

\- In addition, the UE may use either the primary CPICH or a secondary
CPICH as a phase reference.

\- By default (i.e. without any indication by higher layers) the UE may
use the primary CPICH as a phase reference.

\- When a UE is not configured in MIMO mode and not in MIMO mode with
four transmit antennas in a cell: The UE is informed by higher layers
when it may use a secondary CPICH as a phase reference. In this case the
UE shall not use the primary CPICH as a phase reference. Indication that
a secondary CPICH may be a phase reference is also applicable when open
loop or closed loop TX diversity is enabled for a downlink physical
channel in which case Antenna 1 and Antenna 2 secondary CPICH shall be
used as phase references.

\- When the UE is configured in MIMO mode in a cell: The UE is informed
by higher layers when it may use a secondary CPICH as a phase reference
for a second transmit antenna in addition to the primary CPICH which
will be transmitted from the first antenna. In addition, if the UE
supports open loop Tx diversity on associated physical channels with the
combination of primary CPICH and secondary CPICH, this combination of
phase references can also be used as phase references for associated
physical channels configured with open loop Tx diversity. If the UE does
not support open loop Tx diversity on associated physical channels with
the combination of primary CPICH and secondary CPICH and if secondary
CPICH is used as a phase reference for second transmit antenna, UE may
assume that associated physical channels are not in Tx diversity mode.
If no secondary CPICH is signalled as phase reference, the UE may use
the Antenna 1 and Antenna 2 primary CPICH as phase references.

\- When the UE is configured in MIMO mode with four transmit antennas in
a cell: The UE is informed by higher layers when it should use any of
the secondary CPICH as a phase reference for a second, third or fourth
transmit antenna in addition to the primary CPICH which will be
transmitted from the first antenna. In addition, if the UE supports open
loop Tx diversity on associated physical channels with the combination
of primary CPICH and secondary CPICH on second transmit antenna, this
combination of phase references can also be used as phase references for
associated physical channels configured with open loop Tx diversity. If
the UE does not support open loop Tx diversity on associated physical
channels with the combination of primary CPICH and secondary CPICH, then
the UE may assume that associated physical channels are not in Tx
diversity mode.

Note \*: A secondary CPICH should not be configured as a phase reference
for DPCH or F-DPCH when a UE simultaneously receives S-CCPCHs on
different radio links and DPCH or F-DPCH. The UE behavior is undefined
if this configuration is used. The support for simultaneous reception of
S-CCPCHs on different radio links and DPCH or F-DPCH is optional in the
UE.

\*\*: When the UE is configured in MIMO mode with four transmit
antennas, Secondary CPICHs on Antennas 2, 3, and 4 and Demodulation
CPICHs on Antennas 3 and 4 are used as phase reference.

Dedicated pilot bits are never the sole phase reference for any physical
channel, but the UE may always use dedicated pilot bits as a phase
reference for DPCH.

Furthermore, during a DPCH or F-DPCH frame overlapping with any part of
an associated HS-DSCH or HS-SCCH subframe, the phase reference on this
DPCH or F-DPCH shall not change.

#### 5.3.3.3 Primary Common Control Physical Channel (P-CCPCH)

The Primary CCPCH is a fixed rate (30 kbps, SF=256) downlink physical
channels used to carry the BCH transport channel.

Figure 15 shows the frame structure of the Primary CCPCH. The frame
structure differs from the downlink DPCH in that no TPC commands, no
TFCI and no pilot bits are transmitted. The Primary CCPCH is not
transmitted during the first 256 chips of each slot. Instead, Primary
SCH and Secondary SCH are transmitted during this period (see
subclause 5.3.3.5).

##### 5.3.3.3.1 Primary CCPCH structure with STTD encoding

In case the diversity antenna is present in UTRAN and the P-CCPCH is to
be transmitted using open loop transmit diversity, the data bits of the
P-CCPCH are STTD encoded as given in subclause 5.3.1.1.1. The last two
data bits in even numbered slots are STTD encoded together with the
first two data bits in the following slot, except for slot \#14 where
the two last data bits are not STTD encoded and instead transmitted with
equal power from both the antennas, see figure 16. Higher layers signal
whether STTD encoding is used for the P-CCPCH or not. In addition the
presence/absence of STTD encoding on P-CCPCH is indicated by modulating
the SCH, see 5.3.3.4. During power on and hand over between cells the UE
can determine the presence of STTD encoding on the P-CCPCH, by either
receiving the higher layer message, by demodulating the SCH channel, or
by a combination of the above two schemes.

#### 5.3.3.4 Secondary Common Control Physical Channel (S-CCPCH)

The Secondary CCPCH is used to carry the FACH and PCH, and can also be
configured to carry a BCH. There are two types of Secondary CCPCH: those
that include TFCI and those that do not include TFCI. It is the UTRAN
that determines if a TFCI should be transmitted, hence making it
mandatory for all UEs to support the use of TFCI. The set of possible
rates for the Secondary CCPCH is the same as for the downlink DPCH, see
subclause 5.3.2. The frame structure of the Secondary CCPCH is shown in
figure 17.

height="1.9368055555555554in"}

Figure 17: Frame structure for Secondary Common Control Physical Channel

The parameter k in figure 17 determines the total number of bits per
downlink Secondary CCPCH slot. It is related to the spreading factor SF
of the physical channel as SF = 256/2^k^. The spreading factor range is
from 256 down to 4.

The values for the number of bits per field are given in Table 18. The
channel bit and symbol rates given in Table 18 are the rates immediately
before spreading. The slot formats applicable to QPSK with pilot bits
are not supported in this release. The pilot patterns for the slot
formats applicable to QPSK are given in Table 19. DTX shall be used in
the pilot field of the 16QAM slot formats, i.e. no pilot bits are used
in this release. A BCH mapped to Secondary CCPCH uses the specific fixed
Secondary CCPCH slot format in Table 18, and this slot format can only
be used for carrying BCH.

The FACH and PCH can be mapped to the same or to separate Secondary
CCPCHs. If FACH and PCH are mapped to the same Secondary CCPCH, they can
be mapped to the same frame. A BCH mapped to Secondary CCPCH can only be
mapped to a separate Secondary CCPCH without multiplexing with other
transport channels. The main difference between a CCPCH and a downlink
dedicated physical channel is that a CCPCH is not inner-loop power
controlled. The main difference between the Primary and Secondary CCPCH
is that the transport channel mapped to the Primary CCPCH (BCH) can only
have a fixed predefined transport format combination, while the
Secondary CCPCH supports multiple transport format combinations on the
transport channels mapped to it and offers the possibility of using
TFCI.

NOTE 1: The slot formats 18 to 23 in Table 18 are only applicable for
MBSFN operations with 16QAM.

NOTE 2: The modulation used in MBSFN operations is signalled by higher

The pilot symbol pattern described in Table 19 is not supported in this
release. The shadowed part can be used as frame synchronization words.
(The symbol pattern of pilot symbols other than the frame
synchronization word shall be \"11\"). In Table 19, the transmission
order is from left to right. (Each two-bit pair represents an I/Q pair
of QPSK modulation.)

For slot formats using TFCI, the TFCI value in each radio frame
corresponds to a certain transport format combination of the FACHs
and/or PCHs currently in use. This correspondence is (re-)negotiated at
each FACH/PCH addition / removal. The mapping of the TFCI bits onto
slots is described in \[3\].

##### 5.3.3.4.1 Secondary CCPCH structure with STTD encoding

In case the diversity antenna is present in UTRAN and the S-CCPCH does
not carry BCH and is to be transmitted using open loop transmit
diversity, the data and TFCI bits of the S-CCPCH are STTD encoded as
given in subclause 5.3.1.1.1. The pilot symbol pattern for antenna 2 for
the S-CCPCH given in Table 20 is not supported in this release. If
S-CCPCH carries BCH and open loop transmit diversity is to be applied,
the STTD encoding is done the same way as for P-CCPCH as described in
subclause 5.3.3.3.1.

#### 5.3.3.5 Synchronisation Channel (SCH)

The Synchronisation Channel (SCH) is a downlink signal used for cell
search. The SCH consists of two sub channels, the Primary and Secondary
SCH. The 10 ms radio frames of the Primary and Secondary SCH are divided
into 15 slots, each of length 2560 chips. Figure 18 illustrates the
structure of the SCH radio frame.

![](media/image22.wmf){width="6.0777777777777775in"
height="2.1972222222222224in"}

Figure 18: Structure of Synchronisation Channel (SCH)

The Primary SCH consists of a modulated code of length 256 chips, the
Primary Synchronisation Code (PSC) denoted c~p~ in figure 18,
transmitted once every slot. The PSC is the same for every cell in the
system.

The Secondary SCH consists of repeatedly transmitting a length 15
sequence of modulated codes of length 256 chips, the Secondary
Synchronisation Codes (SSC), transmitted in parallel with the Primary
SCH. The SSC is denoted c~s~^i,k^ in figure 18, where *i* = 0, 1, ...,
63 is the number of the scrambling code group, and *k* = 0, 1, ..., 14
is the slot number. Each SSC is chosen from a set of 16 different codes
of length 256. This sequence on the Secondary SCH indicates which of the
code groups the cell\'s downlink scrambling code belongs to.

The primary and secondary synchronization codes are modulated by the
symbol *a* shown in figure 18, which indicates the presence/ absence of
STTD encoding on the P-CCPCH and is given by the following table:

  -------------------------- --------
  P-CCPCH STTD encoded       a = +1
  P-CCPCH not STTD encoded   a = -1
  -------------------------- --------

##### 5.3.3.5.1 SCH transmitted by TSTD

Figure 19 illustrates the structure of the SCH transmitted by the TSTD
scheme. In even numbered slots both PSC and SSC are transmitted on
antenna 1, and in odd numbered slots both PSC and SSC are transmitted on
antenna 2.

#### 5.3.3.7 Acquisition Indicator Channel (AICH)

The Acquisition Indicator channel (AICH) is a fixed rate (SF=256)
physical channel used to carry Acquisition Indicators (AI) and Extended
Acquisition Indicators (EAI). Acquisition Indicator AI~s~ corresponds to
signature s on the PRACH. Extended Acquisition Indicators represent a
set of values corresponding to a set of E-DCH resource configurations.

Figure 21 illustrates the structure of the AICH. The AICH consists of a
repeated sequence of 15 consecutive *access slots* (AS), each of length
5120 chips. Each access slot consists of two parts, an
*Acquisition-Indicator* (AI) part consisting of 32 real-valued signals
a~0~, ..., a~31~ and a part of duration 1024 chips with no transmission
that is not formally part of the AICH. The part of the slot with no
transmission is reserved for possible future use by other physical
channels.

The spreading factor (SF) used for channelisation of the AICH is 256.

The phase reference for the AICH is the Primary CPICH.

Figure 21: Structure of Acquisition Indicator Channel (AICH)

The real-valued signals a~0~, a~1~, ..., a~31~ in figure 21 are given by

where AI~s~, taking the values +1, -1, and 0, is the acquisition
indicator corresponding to signature s and the sequence b~s,0~, ...,
b~s,31~ is given by Table 22, EAI~s\'~, taking the values +1, -1, and 0,
is the extended acquisition indicator corresponding to signature s\' and
the sequence c~s\',0~, ..., c~s\',31~ is given by Table 22B. The
EAI~s\'~ has the same relative transmit power as the AI~s~; the relative
transmit power is indicated by higher layers. If the signature s is not
a member of the set of available signatures for all the Access Service
Class (ASC) for the corresponding PRACH (cf \[5\]) then AI~s~ shall be
set to 0.

The use of acquisition indicators is described in \[5\]. The meaning of
acquisition indicators depends on whether a UE sends an access preamble
signature corresponding to a PRACH message or corresponding to an E-DCH
transmission. Furthermore, if a UE sends an access preamble signature
corresponding to an E-DCH transmission, the meaning of the acquisition
indicator depends on whether EAI is configured or not. The following
rules apply for one PRACH preamble scrambling code. If multiple PRACH
preamble scrambling codes are defined in a cell, then for each of them
the following rules are used independently.

\- If the UE sends an access preamble signature corresponding to a PRACH
message, then;

\- if an Acquisition Indicator is set to +1, it represents a positive
acknowledgement,

\- if an Acquisition Indicator is set to -1, it represents a negative
acknowledgement.

\- If the UE sends an access preamble signature corresponding to an
E-DCH transmission, then;

\- if the corresponding Acquisition Indicator is set to +1, it
represents a positive acknowledgement and the associated default E-DCH
resource configuration is allocated to the UE,

\- if the corresponding Acquisition Indicator is set to -1 and EAI is
not configured, then it represents a negative acknowledgement,

\- if the corresponding Acquisition Indicator is set to -1 and EAI is
configured, then the UE detects which one of the Extended Acquisition
Indicator signatures is present.

The association between the AI and the default E-DCH resource index is
such that, for 10 ms TTI length:

X = SigInd **mod** Y,

The association between the AI and the default E-DCH resource index is
such that, for 2 ms TTI length:

X = (SigInd **mod** (Y - Concurrent TTI partition Index)) + Concurrent
TTI partition Index,

where X is the Default E-DCH resource index, \"Concurrent TTI partition
Index\" is signalled by higher layers or otherwise is set to zero, Y is
the total number of E-DCH resources configured in the cell for Enhanced
Uplink in CELL\_FACH state and IDLE mode, and SigInd is the Nth PRACH
preamble signature corresponding to the AI that is configured available
in the cell and corresponding to E-DCH transmission for Enhanced Uplink
in CELL\_FACH state and IDLE mode. PRACH preamble signatures are
renumbered as specified in \[17\] subclause 8.6.6.29.

The use of Extended Acquisition Indicators is described in \[5\]. If
s\'=0 and an EAI~0~ is set to +1, it represents a negative
acknowledgement. The mapping between the non-zero EAI~s\'~ and the E-DCH
resource configuration index is presented in Table 22A where X is the
index of the default E-DCH resource as defined above and Y is the total
number of E-DCH resources configured in the cell.

The real-valued signals, a~j~, are spread and modulated in the same
fashion as bits when represented in {+1, -1 } form.

In case STTD-based open-loop transmit diversity is applied to AICH, STTD
encoding according to subclause 5.3.1.1.1 is applied to each sequence
b~s,0~, b~s,1~, \..., b~s,31~ separately and sequence c~s\',0~,
c~s\',1~, ..., c~s\',31~ before the sequences are combined into AICH
signals a~0~, ..., a~31~.

#### 5.3.3.10 Paging Indicator Channel (PICH)

The Paging Indicator Channel (PICH) is a fixed rate (SF=256) physical
channel used to carry the paging indicators. The PICH is associated
either with an S-CCPCH to which a PCH transport channel is mapped, or
with a HS-SCCH associated with the HS-PDSCH(s) to which a HS-DSCH
transport channel carrying paging messages is mapped.

Figure 24 illustrates the frame structure of the PICH. One PICH radio
frame of length 10 ms consists of 300 bits (b~0~, b~1~, ..., b~299~). Of
these, 288 bits (b~0~, b~1~, ..., b~287~) are used to carry paging
indicators. The remaining 12 bits are not formally part of the PICH and
shall not be transmitted (DTX). The part of the frame with no
transmission is reserved for possible future use.

![](media/image26.wmf){width="5.4375in" height="1.5625in"}

Figure 24: Structure of Paging Indicator Channel (PICH)

In each PICH frame, Np paging indicators {P~0~, ..., P~Np-1~} are
transmitted, where Np=18, 36, 72, or 144.

The PI calculated by higher layers for use for a certain UE, is
associated to the paging indicator P*~q~*, where *q* is computed as a
function of the PI computed by higher layers, the SFN of the P-CCPCH
radio frame during which the start of the PICH radio frame occurs, and
the number of paging indicators per frame (Np):

![](media/image27.wmf){width="5.819444444444445in" height="0.5in"}

Further, the PI calculated by higher layers is associated with the value
of the paging indicator P*~q~*. If a paging indicator in a certain frame
is set to \"1\" it is an indication that UEs associated with this paging
indicator and PI should read either the corresponding frame of the
associated S-CCPCH, or the corresponding subframes of the associated
HS-SCCH

The PI bitmap in the PCH data frames over Iub contains indication values
for all higher layer PI values possible. Each bit in the bitmap
indicates if the paging indicator associated with that particular PI
shall be set to 0 or 1. Hence, the calculation in the formula above is
to be performed in Node B to make the association between PI and P*~q~*.

The mapping from {P~0~, ..., P~Np-1~} to the PICH bits {b~0~, ...,
b~287~} are according to Table 24.

  Np=144                                       {b~2q~, b~2q+1~} = {1, 1}                  {b~2q~, b~2q+1~} = {0, 0}
  -------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------

When transmit diversity is employed for the PICH, STTD encoding is used
on the PICH bits as described in subclause 5.3.1.1.1.

#### 5.3.3.12 Shared Control Channel (HS-SCCH)

The HS-SCCH is a fixed rate (60 kbps, SF=128) downlink physical channel
used to carry downlink signalling related to HS-DSCH transmission.
Figure 26A illustrates the sub-frame structure of the HS-SCCH.

Figure 26A: Subframe structure for the HS-SCCH

#### 5.3.3.13 High Speed Physical Downlink Shared Channel (HS-PDSCH)

The High Speed Physical Downlink Shared Channel (HS- PDSCH) is used to
carry the High Speed Downlink Shared Channel (HS-DSCH).

A HS-PDSCH corresponds to one channelization code of fixed spreading
factor SF=16 from the set of channelization codes reserved for HS-DSCH
transmission. Multi-code transmission is allowed, which translates to UE
being assigned multiple channelisation codes in the same HS-PDSCH
subframe, depending on its UE capability.

The subframe and slot structure of HS-PDSCH are shown in figure 26B.

Figure 26B: Subframe structure for the HS-PDSCH

An HS-PDSCH may use QPSK, 16QAM or 64QAM modulation symbols. In figure
26B, M is the number of bits per modulation symbols i.e. M=2 for QPSK,
M=4 for 16QAM and M=6 for 64QAM. The slot formats are shown in table 26.

Table 26: HS-DSCH fields

  ----------------- ------------------------- ---------------------------- ---- ------------------------ ------------ -------

All relevant Layer 1 information is transmitted in the associated
HS-SCCH i.e. the HS-PDSCH does not carry any Layer 1 information.

#### 5.3.3.14 E--DCH Absolute Grant Channel (E-AGCH)

An E-DCH Absolute Grant Channel (E-AGCH) is a fixed rate (30 kbps,
SF=256) downlink physical channel carrying uplink E-DCH absolute grants
for uplink E-DCHs associated with the E-AGCH by higher layer signalling.
Figure 26C illustrates the frame and sub-frame structure of the E‑AGCH.

An E-DCH absolute grant shall be transmitted over one E-AGCH sub-frame
or one E-AGCH frame. The transmission over one E-AGCH sub-frame and over
one E-AGCH frame shall be used for UEs for which E-DCH TTI is set to
respectively 2 ms and 10 ms.

Figure 26C: Sub-frame structure for the E-AGCH

#### 5.3.3.14B E-DCH Rank and Offset Channel (E-ROCH)

An E-DCH Rank and Offset Channel (E-ROCH) has the same sub-frame
structure as the E-AGCH defined in section 5.3.3.14. The transmission
shall always take place over one E-ROCH sub-frame. The E-ROCH is only
transmitted to a UE for which the E-DCH TTI is set to 2 ms and the
UL\_MIMO\_Enabled is set to TRUE.

The E-ROCH and E-AGCH can only be transmitted simultaneously to a UE if
they are configured with different channelization codes.

#### 5.3.3.15 MBMS Indicator Channel (MICH)

The MBMS Indicator Channel (MICH) is a fixed rate (SF=256) physical
channel used to carry the MBMS notification indicators. The MICH is
always associated with an S-CCPCH to which a FACH transport channel is
mapped.

Figure 26D illustrates the frame structure of the MICH. One MICH radio
frame of length 10 ms consists of 300 bits (b~0~, b~1~, ..., b~299~). Of
these, 288 bits (b~0~, b~1~, ..., b~287~) are used to carry notification
indicators. The remaining 12 bits are not formally part of the MICH and
shall not be transmitted (DTX).

![](media/image31.wmf){width="5.311111111111111in"
height="1.4916666666666667in"}

Figure 26D: Structure of MBMS Indicator Channel (MICH)

In each MICH frame, Nn notification indicators {N~0~, ..., N~Nn-1~} are
transmitted, where Nn=18, 36, 72, or 144.

The NI calculated by higher layers is associated to the index q of the
notification indicator N*~q~*, where *q* is computed as a function of
the NI computed by higher layers, the SFN of the P-CCPCH radio frame
during which the start of the MICH radio frame occurs, and the number of
notification indicators per frame (Nn):

where G = 2^16^ , C = 25033 and NI is the 16 bit Notification Indicator
calculated by higher layers.

The set of NI signalled over Iub indicates all higher layer NI values
for which the associated notification indicator on MICH shall be set to
1 during the corresponding modification period. Hence, the calculation
in the formula above shall be performed in the Node B every MICH frame
for each NI signalled over Iub to make the association between NI and q
and set the related N*~q~* to 1. All other notification indicators on
MICH shall be set to 0.

The mapping from {N~0~, ..., N~Nn-1~} to the MICH bits {b~0~, ...,
b~287~} are according to table 27.

When transmit diversity is employed for the MICH, STTD encoding is used
on the MICH bits as described in subclause 5.3.1.1.1.

#### 5.3.3.16 Common E-DCH Relative Grant Channel

The Common E-RGCH is a downlink physical channel for UEs in CELL\_FACH
state as described in sub clause 6B.2 of \[5\]. There is no DPCH or
F-DPCH associated with the Common E-RGCH.

The structure, STTD encoding and timing relationship of the Common
E-RGCH follow the rules of the dedicated E‑RGCH for which the cell
transmitting the E-RGCH is not in the E-DCH serving radio link set (sub
clause 5.3.2.4 and 7.11).

6 Mapping and association of physical channels
==============================================

6.1 Mapping of transport channels onto physical channels
--------------------------------------------------------

Figure 27 summarises the mapping of transport channels onto physical
channels.

Figure 27: Transport-channel to physical-channel mapping

The DCHs are coded and multiplexed as described in \[3\], and the
resulting data stream is mapped sequentially (first-in-first-mapped)
directly to the physical channel(s). The mapping of BCH and FACH/PCH is
equally straightforward, where the data stream after coding and
interleaving is mapped sequentially to the CCPCHs. A BCH can be mapped
to either Primary CCPCH or Secondary CCPCH, while FACH/PCH is always
mapped to Secondary CCPCH. Also for the RACH, the coded and interleaved
bits are sequentially mapped to the physical channel, in this case the
message part of the PRACH. The E-DCH is coded as described in \[3\], and
the resulting data stream is mapped sequentially (first-in-first-mapped)
directly to the physical channel(s).

6.2 Association of physical channels and physical signals
---------------------------------------------------------

Figure 28 illustrates the association between physical channels and
physical signals.

Figure 28: Physical channel and physical signal association

7 Timing relationship between physical channels
===============================================

7.1 General
-----------

The P-CCPCH, on which the cell SFN is transmitted, is used as timing
reference for all the physical channels, directly for downlink and
indirectly for uplink.

Figure 29 describes the frame timing of some of the downlink physical
channels; the timing of the remaining downlink physical channels and of
the uplink physical channels is specified in the remaining subclauses.
For the AICH the access slot timing is included. Transmission timing for
uplink physical channels is given by the received timing of downlink
physical channels.

Figure 29: Radio frame timing and access slot timing of downlink
physical channels

The following applies:

\- SCH (primary and secondary), CPICH (primary and secondary and
demodulation CPICHs) and P-CCPCH have identical frame timings.

\- The S-CCPCH timing may be different for different S-CCPCHs, but the
offset from the P-CCPCH frame timing is a multiple of 256 chips, i.e.
τ~S-CCPCH,k~ = T~k~* *× 256 chip, T~k~ ∈ {0, 1, ..., 149}. For S-CCPCH
carrying BCH T~k~ = 0. For MBSFN operations using slot formats 21 to 23
in table 18, the offset shall be set in accordance with
τ~S-CCPCH,k~ = 256 + ** T~k~ */10*.* *× 2560 chip.

\- If the PICH is associated to the S-CCPCH, the PICH timing is τ~PICH~
= 7680 chips prior to its corresponding S-CCPCH frame timing, i.e. the
timing of the S-CCPCH carrying the PCH transport channel with the
corresponding paging information, see also subclause 7.2. If the PICH is
associated to the HS-SCCH, the PICH frame timing is the same as the
HS-SCCH frame timing.

\- AICH access slots \#0 starts the same time as P-CCPCH frames with
(SFN modulo 2) = 0. The AICH/PRACH timing is described in subclauses 7.3
and 7.4 respectively.

\- The DPCH timing may be different for different DPCHs, but the offset
from the P-CCPCH frame timing is a multiple of 256 chips, i.e.
τ~DPCH,n~ = T~n~* *× 256 chip, T~n~ ∈ {0, 1, ..., 149}. The DPCH
(DPCCH/DPDCH) timing relation with uplink DPCCH/DPDCHs is described in
subclause 7.6.

\- The F-DPCH timing may be different for different F-DPCHs, but the
offset from the P-CCPCH frame timing is a multiple of 256 chips, i.e.
τ~F-DPCH,p~ = T~p~* *× 256 chip, T~p~ ∈ {0, 1, ..., 149}. All F-DPCHs
transmitted to a UE from the same HS-DSCH cell set have the same timing.
The F-DPCH timing relation with uplink DPCCH/DPDCHs is described in
subclause 7.6.

\- In case dual-cell E-DCH is configured together with DPDCH, DPCH
(associated with the primary uplink) and F-DPCH (associated with the
secondary uplink) transmitted to a UE from the same HS-DSCH cell set
have the same timing.

\- In the case that DPCCH2 is configured, the F-DPCH associated with the
uplink DPCCH2 has the same timing as DPCH or F-DPCH associated with the
uplink DPCCH.

\- The start of HS-SCCH subframe \#0 is aligned with the start of the
P-CCPCH frames. The relative timing between a HS-PDSCH and the
corresponding HS-SCCH is described in subclause 7.8.

\- The E-HICH, E-RGCH, E-AGCH and E-ROCH downlink timing are
respectively specified in subclause 7.10, 7.11, 7.12 and 7.12A. The
E‑DPCCH and E‑DPDCH uplink timing are specified in subclause 7.13.

\- For a secondary serving HS-DSCH cell, the nominal radio frame timing
for CPICH and timing reference are the same as the radio frame timing
for CPICH and timing reference for the serving HS-DSCH cell.

\- The F-TPICH timing may be different for different F-TPICHs, but the
offset from the P-CCPCH frame timing is a multiple of 256 chips, i.e.
τ~F-TPICH,m~ = T~m~* *× 256 chip, T~m~ ∈ {0, 1, ..., 149}.

7.2 PICH/S-CCPCH timing relation
--------------------------------

Figure 30 illustrates the timing between a PICH frame and its associated
single S-CCPCH frame, i.e. the S-CCPCH frame that carries the paging
information related to the paging indicators in the PICH frame. A paging
indicator set in a PICH frame means that the paging message is
transmitted on the PCH in the S-CCPCH frame starting τ~PICH~ chips after
the transmitted PICH frame. τ~PICH~ is defined in subclause 7.1.

Figure 30: Timing relation between PICH frame and associated S-CCPCH
frame

7.2A PICH/HS-SCCH timing relation
---------------------------------

Figure 30a illustrates the timing between a PICH frame and its set of 5
associated HS-SCCH subframes. The first associated subframe of the
associated HS-SCCH starts one HS-SCCH sub-frame after the transmitted
PICH frame and is the HS-SCCH subframe number 1 as defined in subclause
7.1. A paging indicator set in a PICH frame means that one or more
HS-DSCH subframes may be transmitted to the UE on the HS-PDSCH(s)
associated with the HS-SCCH subframes associated with the PICH as
defined in \[5\].

Figure 30a: Timing relation between PICH frame and associated HS-SCCH
subframes

7.3 PRACH/AICH timing relation
------------------------------

The downlink AICH is divided into downlink access slots, each access
slot is of length 5120 chips. The downlink access slots are time aligned
with the P-CCPCH as described in subclause 7.1.

The uplink PRACH is divided into uplink access slots, each access slot
is of length 5120 chips. Uplink access slot number *n* is transmitted
from the UE τ~p-a~ chips prior to the reception of downlink access slot
number *n*, *n* = 0, 1, ..., 14.

Transmission of downlink acquisition indicators may only start at the
beginning of a downlink access slot. Similarly, transmission of uplink
RACH preambles and RACH message parts may only start at the beginning of
an uplink access slot.

The PRACH/AICH timing relation is shown in figure 31.

height="2.2152777777777777in"}

Figure 31: Timing relation between PRACH and AICH as seen at the UE

The preamble-to-preamble distance τ~p-p~ shall be larger than or equal
to the minimum preamble-to-preamble distance\
τ~p-p,min~, i.e. τ~p-p~ ≥ τ~p-p,min~.

In addition to τ~p-p,min~, the preamble-to-AI distance τ~p-a~ and
preamble-to-message distance τ~p-m~ are defined as follows:

\- when AICH\_Transmission\_Timing is set to 0, then

τ~p-p,min~ = 15360 chips (3 access slots)

τ~p-a~ = 7680 chips

τ~p-m~ = 15360 chips (3 access slots)

\- when AICH\_Transmission\_Timing is set to 1, then

τ~p-p,min~ = 20480 chips (4 access slots)

τ~p-a~ = 12800 chips

τ~p-m~ = 20480 chips (4 access slots)

The parameter AICH\_Transmission\_Timing is signalled by higher layers.

7.6 DPCCH/DPDCH timing relations
--------------------------------

### 7.6.1 Uplink

In uplink all the DPCCHs and all the DPDCHs transmitted from one UE have
the same frame timing.

### 7.6.2 Downlink

In downlink, the DPCCH and all the DPDCHs carrying CCTrCHs of dedicated
type to one UE have the same frame timing.

Note: support of multiple CCTrChs of dedicated type is not part of the
current release.

### 7.6.3 Uplink/downlink timing at UE

At the UE, the uplink DPCCH/DPDCH frame transmission takes place
approximately T~0~ chips after the reception of the first detected path
(in time) of the corresponding downlink DPCCH/DPDCH or F-DPCH frame.
T~0~ is a constant defined to be 1024 chips. The first detected path (in
time) is defined implicitly by the relevant tests in \[14\]. More
information about the uplink/downlink timing relation and meaning of
T~0~ can be found in \[5\].

7.7 Uplink DPCCH/HS-DPCCH/HS-PDSCH timing at the UE
---------------------------------------------------

### 7.7.1 Timing when Multiflow is not configured

Figure 34 shows the timing offset between the uplink DPCH, the HS-PDSCH
and the HS-DPCCH at the UE. An HS-DPCCH sub-frame starts
$m \times \text{256}$ chips after the start of an uplink DPCH frame that
corresponds to the DL DPCH or F-DPCH frame from the HS-DSCH serving cell
containing the beginning of the related HS-PDSCH subframe with *m*
calculated as

*m* = (T~TX\_diff~ /256 ) + 101

where T~TX\_diff~ is the difference in chips (T~TX\_diff~ =0, 256,
\....., 38144), between

\- the transmit timing of the start of the related HS-PDSCH subframe
(see sub-clauses 7.8 and 7.1)

and

\- the transmit timing of the start of the downlink DPCH or F-DPCH frame
from the HS-DSCH serving cell that contains the beginning of the
HS-PDSCH subframe (see sub-clause 7.1).

At any one time, *m* therefore takes one of a set of five possible
values according to the transmission timing of HS-DSCH sub-frame timings
relative to the DPCH or F-DPCH frame boundary. The UE and Node B shall
only update the set of values of *m* in connection to UTRAN
reconfiguration of downlink timing.

More information about uplink timing adjustments can be found in \[5\].

Figure 34: Timing structure at the UE for HS-DPCCH control signalling

### 7.7.2 Timing when Multiflow is configured

The uplink DPCH, the HS-PDSCH of the time reference cell, and uplink
HS-DPCCH follow the same time as defined for the non-Multiflow case in
section 7.7.1.

The timing relationship between the non-time reference cell\'s HS-PDSCH
subframe and the related HS-DPCCH subframe is derived from HS-PDSCH
frame timing difference τ~DIFF~ of the two cells, where -20 ≤ τ~DIFF~ ≤
3860 chips. The time reference cell for HS-DPCCH is indicated by higher
layers.

If τ~DIFF~ is not within the specified limits:

\- HARQ-ACK reporting for the time-reference cell and CQI reporting for
both cells are not interrupted.

\- The UE is not required to transmit a valid HARQ-ACK for the non-time
reference cell.

If the UE is not configured in MIMO mode in any cell, or it is
configured in MIMO mode in at least one cell and the UE indicated not
requiring a *Longer HARQ Processing Time* in higher layer capability
signalling, then:

Figure 34a shows the timing offset between the uplink DPCH, the
HS-PDSCHs and the HS-DPCCH at the UE when the UE is configured with
Multiflow. In this case τ~DIFF\ =~ τ~non-time\ reference\ cell~ -
τ~time\ reference\ cell~.

If the UE is configured in MIMO mode in at least one cell and the UE
indicated requiring a *Longer HARQ processing Time* in higher layer
capability signalling, then:

Figure 34b shows the timing offset between the uplink DPCH, the
HS-PDSCHs and the HS-DPCCH at the UE when the UE is configured with
Multiflow. In this case τ~DIFF\ =~ τ~time\ reference\ cell~ - τ
~non-time\ reference\ cell~.

τ~time\ reference\ cell~ and τ~non-time\ reference\ cell~ above refer to
the end times of the HS-PDSCH subframes of the time reference cell and
the non-time reference cell respectively, with the corresponding
HARQ-ACK fields in the same HS-DPCCH sub-frame.

T~TX\_diff1~ corresponds to the smallest T~TX\_diff~ value of the time
reference cell as configured by higher layers. One T~TX\_diff~ value of
the non-time reference cell shall be selected, denoted as
$T_{{\text{TX}_{\text{diff}}2}^{,}}$, where the associated HS-PDSCH
subframe of the time reference cell with T~TX\_diff1~ and the associated
HS-PDSCH subframe of the non-time reference cell with
$T_{{\text{TX}_{\text{diff}}2}^{,}}$, correspond to the same HARQ-ACK
field in the same HS-DPCCH sub-frame. T~TX\_diff2~ is defined as in
Table 28.

  **Condition:**                                                      ***T~TX\_diff2~* defined as:**
  When $T_{{\text{TX}_{\text{diff}}2}^{,}} < 2 \ast \text{7680}$      
  When $T_{{\text{TX}_{\text{diff}}2}^{,}} \geq 2 \ast \text{7680}$   
  ------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------

7.8 HS-SCCH/HS-PDSCH timing
---------------------------

Figure 35 shows the relative timing between the HS-SCCH and the
associated HS-PDSCH for one HS-DSCH sub-frame. The HS-PDSCH starts
τ~HS-PDSCH~ = 2×T~slot~ = 5120 chips after the start of the HS-SCCH.

Figure 35: Timing relation between the HS-SCCH and the associated
HS-PDSCH.

7.9 MICH/S-CCPCH timing relation
--------------------------------

Figure 36 illustrates the timing between the MICH frame boundaries and
the frame boundaries of the associated S‑CCPCH, i.e. the S-CCPCH that
carries the MBMS control information related to the notification
indicators in the MICH frame. The MICH transmission timing shall be such
that the end of radio frame boundary occurs τ~MICH~ chips before the
associated S-CCPCH start of radio frame boundary. τ~MICH~ is equal to
7680 chips.

The MICH frames during which the Node B shall set specific notification
indicators and the S‑CCPCH frames during which the Node B shall transmit
the corresponding MBMS control data is defined by higher layers.

frame

7.10 E-HICH/P-CCPCH/DPCH timing relation
----------------------------------------

The timing of the E-HICH relative to the P-CCPCH is illustrated in
figure 37.

When the E-DCH TTI is 10 ms the E-HICH frame offset relative to P‑CCPCH
shall be τ~E-HICH,n~ chips with

$\tau_{E - \text{HICH},n} = \text{5120} + \text{7680} \times \left\lfloor \frac{\left( \tau_{\text{DPCH},n}/\text{256} \right) - \text{70}}{\text{30}} \right\rfloor$

When the E-DCH TTI is 2 ms the E-HICH frame offset relative to P‑CCPCH
shall be τ~E-HICH,n~ chips with

$\tau_{E - \text{HICH},n} = \text{5120} + \text{7680} \times \left\lfloor \frac{\left( \tau_{\text{DPCH},n}/\text{256} \right) + \text{50}}{\text{30}} \right\rfloor$

When a downlink F-DPCH is configured,
$\tau_{\text{DPCH},n} = \tau_{F - \text{DPCH},n}$.

Figure 37: E-HICH timing

7.11 E-RGCH/P-CCPCH/DPCH timing relation
----------------------------------------

The timing of the E-RGCH relative to the P-CCPCH is illustrated in
figure 38.

When transmitted to a UE for which the cell transmitting the E-RGCH is
in the E-DCH serving radio link set, the E-RGCH frame offset shall be as
follows:

\- if the E-DCH TTI is 10 ms, the E-RGCH frame offset relative to
P‑CCPCH shall be τ~E-RGCH,n~ chips with

$\tau_{E - \text{RGCH},n} = \text{5120} + \text{7680} \times \left\lfloor \frac{\left( \tau_{\text{DPCH},n}/\text{256} \right) - \text{70}}{\text{30}} \right\rfloor$

\- if the E-DCH TTI is 2 ms the E-RGCH frame offset relative to P‑CCPCH
shall be τ~E-RGCH,n~ chips with

$\tau_{E - \text{RGCH},n} = \text{5120} + \text{7680} \times \left\lfloor \frac{\left( \tau_{\text{DPCH},n}/\text{256} \right) + \text{50}}{\text{30}} \right\rfloor$

When a downlink F-DPCH is configured,
$\tau_{\text{DPCH},n} = \tau_{F - \text{DPCH},n}$.

When transmitted to a UE for which the cell transmitting the E-RGCH is
not in the E-DCH serving radio link set, the E-RGCH frame offset
relative to P‑CCPCH shall be τ~E-RGCH~ = 5120 chips.

Figure 38: E-RGCH timing

7.12 E-AGCH/P-CCPCH timing relation
-----------------------------------

The E-AGCH frame offset relative to P‑CCPCH shall be τ~E-AGCH~ = 5120
chips as illustrated in figure 39.

Figure 39: E-AGCH timing

7.12A E-ROCH/P-CCPCH timing relation
------------------------------------

The E-ROCH frame offset relative to P‑CCPCH shall be τ~E-ROCH~ = 5120
chips as illustrated in figure 39A.

Figure 39A: E-ROCH timing

7.13 E-DPDCH/E-DPCCH/DPCCH timing relation
------------------------------------------

The frame timing of all the E-DPCCHs and all the E-DPDCHs transmitted
from one UE shall be the same as the uplink DPCCH frame timing.

7.14 S-DPCCH/DPCCH timing relation
----------------------------------

The frame timing of uplink S-DPCCH transmitted from one UE shall be the
same as the uplink DPCCH frame timing.

7.15 DPCH/F-DPCH/F-TPICH timing relations in softer handover
------------------------------------------------------------

When UE is in softer handover and F-TPICH is transmitted from multiple
radio links as defined in \[5\], the F-TPICH radio frame starts 512
chips after the start of the DPCH/F-DPCH radio frame that corresponds to
the same radio link.

7.16 S-E-DPDCH/S-E-DPCCH/DPCCH timing relation
----------------------------------------------

The frame timing of the S-E-DPCCH and all the S-E-DPDCHs transmitted
from one UE shall be the same as the uplink DPCCH frame timing.

7.17 DPCCH2/DPCCH timing relation
