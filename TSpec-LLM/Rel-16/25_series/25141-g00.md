3 Definitions and abbreviations
===============================

3.1 Definitions
---------------

For the purposes of the present document, the following terms and
definitions apply:

**Ancillary RF amplifier:** piece of equipment, which when connected by
RF coaxial cables to the BS, has the primary function to provide
amplification between the transmit and/or receive antenna connector of a
BS and an antenna without requiring any control signal to fulfil its
amplifying function.

**Bit Error Ratio:** ratio of the bits wrongly received to all data bits
sent.

NOTE: The bits are the data bits above the convolutional/turbo decoder.
The BER is the overall BER independent of frame erasures or when erased
frames are not defined.

**Block Error Ratio:** ratio of the number of erroneous blocks received
to the total number of blocks sent.

NOTE: An erroneous block is a Transport Block whose cyclic redundancy
check (CRC) is wrong.

**Mean power:** power (transmitted or received) in a bandwidth of at
least (1+ α) times the chip rate of the radio access mode.

NOTE1: α = 0,22 is the roll off factor of the WCDMA signal. The roll-off
factor α factor is defined in \[1\] section 6.8.1.

NOTE2: The period of measurement shall be at least one timeslot unless
otherwise stated.

**RRC filtered mean power:** mean power as measured through a root
raised cosine filter with roll-off factor α and a bandwidth equal to the
chip rate of the radio access mode.

NOTE 1: The RRC filtered mean power of a perfectly modulated W-CDMA
signal is 0,246 dB lower than the mean power of the same signal.

NOTE 2: The roll-off factor α factor is defined in \[1\] section 6.8.1.

**Code domain power:** part of the mean power which correlates with a
particular (OVSF) code channel.

NOTE: The sum of all powers in the code domain equals the mean power in
a bandwidth of (1+ α) times the chip rate of the radio access mode. See
Annex E.2.5.1.

**Output power:** mean power of one carrier of the base station,
delivered to a load with resistance equal to the nominal load impedance

same base station.

NOTE: There may be multiple instances of sub-blocks within an Base
Station RF Bandwidth.

**Sub-block bandwidth:** bandwidth of one sub-block.

within a Base Station RF Bandwidth, where the RF requirements in the gap
are based on co-existence for un-coordinated operation.

**Lower sub-block edge:** frequency at the lower edge of one sub-block.

NOTE: It is used as a frequency reference point for both transmitter and
receiver requirements.

**Upper sub-block edge:** frequency at the higher edge of one sub-block.

NOTE: It is used as a frequency reference point for both transmitter and
receiver requirements.

**Multi-band Base Station:** base station characterized by the ability
of its transmitter and/or receiver to process two or more carriers in
common active RF components simultaneously, where at least one carrier
is configured at a different operating band (which is not a sub-band or
superseding-band of another supported operating band) than the other
carrier(s).

**Inter-band gap**: The frequency gap between two supported consecutive
operating bands.

**Inter RF Bandwidth gap:** frequency gap between two consecutive Base
Station RF Bandwidths that are placed within two supported operating
**bands**.

b\) UTRA/FDD can support both fixed and variable transmit to receive
frequency separation.

c\) The use of other transmit to receive frequency separations in
existing or other frequency bands shall not be precluded.

d\) When configured to operate in DC-HSDPA with a single UL frequency,
the TX-RX frequency separation in Table 3.0A shall be applied for the
serving HS-DSCH cell. For bands XII, XIII and XIV, the TX-RX frequency
separation in Table 3.0A shall be the minimum spacing between the UL and
either of the DL carriers.

e\) When configured to operate on dual cells in both the DL and UL, the
TX-RX frequency separation in Table 3.0A shall be applied to the primary
UL frequency and DL frequency of the serving HS-DSCH cell, and to the
secondary UL frequency and the frequency of the secondary serving
HS-DSCH cell respectively.

f\) When configured to operate on single/dual band 4C-HSDPA or single
band 8C-HSDPA or single band NC-4C-HSDPA with a single UL frequency, the
TX-RX frequency separation in Table 3.0A shall be applied for the DL
frequency of the serving HS-DSCH cell. When configured to operate on
single/dual band 4C-HSDPA or single band 8C-HSDPA or single band
NC-4C-HSDPA with dual UL frequencies, the TX-RX frequency separation in
Table 3.0A shall be applied to the primary UL frequency and DL frequency
of the serving HS-DSCH cell, and to the secondary UL frequency and the
frequency of the 1st secondary serving HS-DSCH cell respectively.

g\) For bands XII, XIII and XIV, the requirements in TS 25.104 are
applicable only for a single uplink carrier frequency, however dual cell
uplink operation may be considered in future releases.

h\) When configured to operate on dual band dual cell HSDPA or dual band
4C-HSDPA with dual band UL frequencies, the TX-RX frequency separation
in Table 3.0A shall be applied to the primary UL frequency and DL
frequency of the serving HS-DSCH cell, and to the secondary UL frequency
and the frequency of the 1st secondary serving HS-DSCH cell
respectively.

3.5 Channel arrangement
-----------------------

### 3.5.1 Channel spacing

The nominal channel spacing is 5 MHz, but this can be adjusted to
optimise performance in a particular deployment scenario.

### 3.5.2 Channel raster

The channel raster is 200 kHz for all bands, which means that the centre
frequency must be an integer multiple of 200 kHz. In addition a number
of additional centre frequencies are specified according to table 3.2,
which means that the centre frequencies for these channels are shifted
100 kHz relative to the general raster.

### 3.5.3 Channel number

The carrier frequency is designated by the UTRA Absolute Radio Frequency
Channel Number (UARFCN). For each operating Band, the UARFCN values are
defined as follows.

Uplink: N~U~ = 5 \* (F~UL~ - F~UL\_Offset~), for the carrier frequency
range F~UL\_low~ ≤ F~UL~ ≤  F~UL\_high~

Downlink: N~D~ = 5 \* (F~DL~ - F~DL\_Offset~), for the carrier frequency
range F~DL\_low~ ≤ F~DL~ ≤  F~DL\_high~

For each operating Band, F~UL\_Offset~, F~UL\_low~, F~UL\_high~,
F~DL\_Offset~,, F~DL\_low~ and F~DL\_high~ are defined in Table 3.1 for
the general UARFCN. For the additional UARFCN, F~UL\_Offset~,

4 General test conditions and declarations
==========================================

Many of the tests in this specification measure a parameter relative to
a value that is not fully specified in the UTRA specifications. For
these tests, the Minimum Requirement is determined relative to a nominal
value specified by the manufacturer.

Certain functions of a BS are optional in the UTRA specifications. Some
requirements for the BS may be regional as listed in clause 4.7.

When specified in a test, the manufacturer shall declare the nominal
value of a parameter, or whether an option is supported. The
manufacturer declarations are listed in clauses 4.8 and 4.11.

4.1 Acceptable uncertainty of Test System
-----------------------------------------

The maximum acceptable uncertainty of the Test System is specified below
for each test, where appropriate. The Test System shall enable the
stimulus signals in the test case to be adjusted to within the specified
tolerance and the equipment under test to be measured with an
uncertainty not exceeding the specified values. All tolerances and
uncertainties are absolute values, and are valid for a confidence level
of 95 %, unless otherwise stated.

A confidence level of 95% is the measurement uncertainty tolerance
interval for a specific measurement that contains 95% of the performance
of a population of test equipment.

For RF tests, it should be noted that the uncertainties in clause 4.1
apply to the Test System operating into a nominal 50 ohm load and do not
include system effects due to mismatch between the DUT and the Test
System.

### 4.1.1 Measurement of test environments

The measurement accuracy of the BS test environments defined in Clause
4.4, Test environments shall be.

> Pressure: ±5 kPa.
>
> Temperature: ±2 degrees.
>
> Relative Humidity: ±5 %.
>
> DC Voltage: ±1,0 %.
>
> AC Voltage: ±1,5 %.
>
> Vibration: 10 %.
>
> Vibration frequency: 0,1 Hz.

The above values shall apply unless the test environment is otherwise
controlled and the specification for the control of the test environment
specifies the uncertainty for the parameter.

4.2 Test Tolerances (informative)
---------------------------------

The Test Tolerances defined in this clause have been used to relax the
Minimum Requirements in this specification to derive the Test
Requirements.

The Test Tolerances are derived from Test System uncertainties,
regulatory requirements and criticality to system performance. As a
result, the Test Tolerances may sometimes be set to zero.

The test tolerances should not be modified for any reason e.g. to take
account of commonly known test system errors (such as mismatch, cable
loss, etc.)

### 4.2.4 RRM measurements

The following tolerances refer to the requirements of 25.133.

tbd

4.3 Interpretation of measurement results
-----------------------------------------

The measurement results returned by the Test System are compared -
without any modification - against the Test Requirements as defined by
the shared risk principle.

The Shared Risk principle is defined in ITU-R M.1545 \[17\].

The actual measurement uncertainty of the Test System for the
measurement of each parameter shall be included in the test report.

The recorded value for the Test System uncertainty shall be, for each
measurement, equal to or lower than the appropriate figure in clause 4.1
of this specification.

If the Test System for a test is known to have a measurement uncertainty
greater than that specified in clause 4.1, it is still permitted to use
this apparatus provided that an adjustment is made as follows.

Any additional uncertainty in the Test System over and above that
specified in clause 4.1 shall be used to tighten the Test
Requirement-making the test harder to pass. (For some tests e.g.
receiver tests, this may require modification of stimulus signals). This
procedure (defined in Annex F) will ensure that a Test System not
compliant with clause 4.1does not increase the chance of passing a
device under test where that device would otherwise have failed the test
if a Test System compliant with clause 4.1 had been used.

4.3A Base station classes
-------------------------

The requirements in the present document apply to Wide Area Base
Stations, Medium Range Base Stations, Local Area Base Stations and Home
Base Stations unless otherwise stated.

Wide Area Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived from
Macro Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equal to
70 dB. The Wide Area Base Station class has the same requirements as the
base station for General Purpose application in Release 99, 4 and 5.

Medium Range Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived
from Micro Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equal to
53 dB.

Local Area Base Stations are **characterised by requirements derived
from Pico Cell** scenarios with **a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equal
to 45 dB**.

Home Base Stations are **characterised by requirements derived from
Femto Cell** scenarios.

The manufacturer shall declare the intended class of the BS under test.

4.4 Test environments
---------------------

For each test in the present document, the environmental conditions
under which the BS is to be tested are defined.

### 4.4.1 Normal test environment

When a normal test environment is specified for a test, the test should
be performed within the minimum and maximum limits of the conditions
stated in table 4.2.

Table 4.2: Limits of conditions for Normal Test Environment

  --------------------- ------------------------------------------ ---------
  Condition             Minimum                                    Maximum
  Barometric pressure   86 kPa                                     106 kPa
  Temperature           15°C                                       30°C
  Relative Humidity     20 %                                       85 %
  Power supply          Nominal, as declared by the manufacturer   
  Vibration             Negligible                                 
  --------------------- ------------------------------------------ ---------

The ranges of barometric pressure, temperature and humidity represent
the maximum variation expected in the uncontrolled environment of a test
laboratory. If it is not possible to maintain these parameters within
the specified limits, the actual values shall be recorded in the test
report.

NOTE: This may, for instance, be the case for measurements of radiated
emissions performed on an open field test site.

### 4.4.2 Extreme test environment

The manufacturer shall declare one of the following:

1\) the equipment class for the equipment under test, as defined in the
IEC 60 721-3-3 \[6\];

2\) the equipment class for the equipment under test, as defined in the
IEC 60 721-3-4 \[7\];

3\) the equipment that does not comply to the mentioned classes, the
relevant classes from IEC 60 721 documentation for Temperature, Humidity
and Vibration shall be declared.

NOTE: Reduced functionality for conditions that fall outside of the
standard operational conditions is not tested in the present document.
These may be stated and tested separately.

#### 4.4.2.1 Extreme temperature

When an extreme temperature test environment is specified for a test,
the test shall be performed at the standard minimum and maximum
operating temperatures defined by the manufacturer\'s declaration for
the equipment under test.

**Minimum temperature:**

The test shall be performed with the environment test equipment and
methods including the required environmental phenomena into the
equipment, conforming to the test procedure of IEC 60 068-2-1 \[8\].

**Maximum temperature:**

The test shall be performed with the environmental test equipment and
methods including the required environmental phenomena into the
equipment, conforming to the test procedure of IEC 60 068-2-2 \[9\].

NOTE: It is recommended that the equipment is made fully operational
prior to the equipment being taken to its lower operating temperature.

### 4.4.3 Vibration

When vibration conditions are specified for a test, the test shall be
performed while the equipment is subjected to a vibration sequence as
defined by the manufacturer's declaration for the equipment under test.
This shall use the environmental test equipment and methods of inducing
the required environmental phenomena in to the equipment, conforming to
the test procedure of IEC 60 068-2-6 \[10\]. Other environmental
conditions shall be within the ranges specified in clause 4.4.1.

NOTE: The higher levels of vibration may induce undue physical stress in
to equipment after a prolonged series of tests. The testing body should
only vibrate the equipment during the RF measurement process.

### 4.4.4 Power supply

When extreme power supply conditions are specified for a test, the test
shall be performed at the standard upper and lower limits of operating
voltage defined by manufacturer\'s declaration for the equipment under
test.

**Upper voltage limit:**

The equipment shall be supplied with a voltage equal to the upper limit
declared by the manufacturer (as measured at the input terminals to the
equipment). The tests shall be carried out at the steady state minimum
and maximum temperature limits declared by the manufacturer for the
equipment, to the methods described in IEC 60 068-2-1 \[8\] Test Ab/Ad
and IEC 60 068-2-2 \[9\] Test Bb/Bd: Dry Heat.

**Lower voltage limit:**

The equipment shall be supplied with a voltage equal to the lower limit
declared by the manufacturer (as measured at the input terminals to the
equipment). The tests shall be carried out at the steady state minimum
and maximum temperature limits declared by the manufacturer for the
equipment, to the methods described in IEC 60 068-2-1 \[8\] Test Ab/Ad
and IEC 60 068-2-2 \[9\] Test Bb/Bd: Dry Heat.

### 4.4.5 Definition of Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) Interferer

The minimum bandwidth of the AWGN interferer shall be 1.5 times chip
rate of the radio access mode. (e.g. 5.76 MHz for a chip rate of 3.84
Mcps). The flatness across this minimum bandwidth shall be less than
±0.5 dB and the peak to average ratio at a probability of 0.001% shall
exceed 10 dB.

4.5 Selection of configurations for testing
-------------------------------------------

Most tests in the present document are only performed for a subset of
the possible combinations of test conditions. For instance:

‑ not all transceivers in the configuration may be specified to be
tested;

‑ only one RF channel may be specified to be tested;

‑ only one timeslot may be specified to be tested.

When a test is performed by a test laboratory, the choice of which
combinations are to be tested shall be specified by the laboratory. The
laboratory may consult with operators, the manufacturer or other bodies.

When a test is performed by a manufacturer, the choice of which
combinations are to be tested may be specified by an operator.

4.6 BS Configurations
---------------------

### 4.6.1 Receiver diversity

For the tests in clause 7 of the present document, the requirement
applies at each receiver antenna connector for receivers with antenna
diversity.

Receiver requirements are tested at the antenna connector, with the
remaining receiver(s) disabled or their antenna connector(s) being
terminated. If the manufacturer has declared the receiver paths to be
equivalent, it is sufficient to apply the specified test signal at any
one of the receiver antenna connectors.

For a multi-band BS, multi-band tests for ACS, blocking and
intermodulation are performed with the interferer(s) applied to each
antenna connector mapped to the receiver for the wanted signal(s),
however only to one antenna at a time. Antenna connectors to which no
signals are applied are terminated.

### 4.6.2 Duplexers

The requirements of the present document shall be met with a duplexer
fitted, if a duplexer is supplied as part of the BS. If the duplexer is
supplied as an option by the manufacturer, sufficient tests should be
repeated with and without the duplexer fitted to verify that the BS
meets the requirements of the present document in both cases.

The following tests should be performed with the duplexer fitted, and
without it fitted if this is an option:

1\) clause 6.2.1, base station maximum output power, for the highest
static power step only, if this is measured at the antenna connector;

2\) clause 6.5, output RF spectrum emissions; outside the BS transmit
band;

3\) clause 6.5.3.4.3, protection of the BS receiver;

4\) clause 6.6, transmit intermodulation; for the testing of
conformance, the carrier frequencies should be selected to minimize
intermodulation products from the transmitters falling in receive
channels.

The remaining tests may be performed with or without the duplexer
fitted.

NOTE 1: When performing receiver tests with a duplexer fitted, it is
important to ensure that the output from the transmitters does not
affect the test apparatus. This can be achieved using a combination of
attenuators, isolators and filters.

NOTE 2: When duplexers are used, intermodulation products will be
generated, not only in the duplexer but also in the antenna system. The
intermodulation products generated in the antenna system are not
controlled by 3GPP specifications, and may degrade during operation
(e.g. due to moisture ingress). Therefore, to ensure continued
satisfactory operation of a BS, an operator will normally select ARFCNs
to minimize intermodulation products falling on receive channels. For
testing of complete conformance, an operator may specify the ARFCNs to
be used.

### 4.6.3 Power supply options

If the BS is supplied with a number of different power supply
configurations, it may not be necessary to test RF parameters for each
of the power supply options, provided that it can be demonstrated that
the range of conditions over which the equipment is tested is at least
as great as the range of conditions due to any of the power supply
configurations.

This applies particularly if a BS contains a DC rail which can be
supplied either externally or from an internal mains power supply. In
this case, the conditions of extreme power supply for the mains power
supply options can be tested by testing only the external DC supply
option. The range of DC input voltages for the test should be sufficient
to verify the performance with any of the power supplies, over its range
of operating conditions within the BS, including variation of mains
input voltage, temperature and output current.

### 4.6.4 Ancillary RF amplifiers

The requirements of the present document shall be met with the ancillary
RF amplifier fitted. At tests according to clauses 6 and 7 for TX and RX
respectively, the ancillary amplifier is connected to the BS by a
connecting network ( including any cable(s), attenuator(s), etc.) with
applicable loss to make sure the appropriate operating conditions of the
ancillary amplifier and the BS. The applicable connecting network loss
range is declared by the manufacturer. Other characteristics and the
temperature dependence of the attenuation of the connecting network are
neglected. The actual attenuation value of the connecting network is
chosen for each test as one of the applicable extreme values. The lowest
value is used unless otherwise stated.

Sufficient tests should be repeated with the ancillary amplifier fitted
and, if it is optional, without the ancillary RF amplifier to verify
that the BS meets the requirements of the present document in both
cases.

When testing, the following tests should be repeated with the optional
ancillary amplifier fitted according to the table below, where x denotes
that the test is applicable:

NOTE: Combining can be by duplex filters or any other network. The
amplifiers can either be in RX or TX branch or in both. Either one of
these amplifiers could be a passive network.

In test according to clauses 6.2 and 7.2 highest applicable attenuation
value is applied.

### 4.6.5 BS using antenna arrays

A BS may be configured with a multiple antenna port connection for some
or all of its transceivers or with an antenna array related to one cell
(not one array per transceiver). This clause applies to a BS which meets
at least one of the following conditions:

\- the transmitter output signals from one or more transceiver appear at
more than one antenna port; or

\- there is more than one receiver antenna port for a transceiver or per
cell and an input signal is required at more than one port for the
correct operation of the receiver thus the outputs from the transmitters
as well as the inputs to the receivers are directly connected to several
antennas (known as \"aircombining\"); or

\- transmitters and receivers are connected via duplexers to more than
one antenna.

In case of diversity or MIMO, multiple antennas are not considered as an
antenna array. If a BS is used, in normal operation, in conjunction with
an antenna system which contains filters or active elements which are
necessary to meet the UTRA requirements, the conformance tests may be
performed on a system comprising the BS together with these elements,
supplied separately for the purposes of testing. In this case, it must
be demonstrated that the performance of the configuration under test is
representative of the system in normal operation, and the conformance
assessment is only applicable when the BS is used with the antenna
system.

For conformance testing of such a BS, the following procedure may be
used.

#### 4.6.5.1 Receiver tests

For each test, the test signals applied to the receiver antenna
connectors shall be such that the sum of the powers of the signals
applied equals the power of the test signal(s) specified in the test.

An example of a suitable test set-up is shown in figure 4.1.

Figure 4.1: Receiver test set-up

For spurious emissions from the receiver antenna connector, the test may
be performed separately for each receiver antenna connector.

#### 4.6.5.2 Transmitter tests

For each test, the test signals applied to the transmitter antenna
connectors **(P~i~)** shall be such that the sum of the powers of the
signals applied equals the power of the test signal(s) **(P~s~)**
specified in the test. This may be assessed by separately measuring the
signals emitted by each antenna connector and summing the results, or by
combining the signals and performing a single measurement. The
characteristics (e.g. amplitude and phase) of the combining network
should be such that the power of the combined signal is maximised.

An example of a suitable test set-up is shown in figure 4.2.

Figure 4.2: Transmitter test set-up

For Intermodulation attenuation, the test may be performed separately
for each transmitter antenna connector.

### 4.6.6 Transmit diversity and MIMO transmission

Unless otherwise stated, for the tests in clause 6 of the present
document, the requirement applies for each transmitter antenna connector
in case of transmit diversity, DB-DC-HSDPA or MIMO transmission.

Transmitter requirements are tested at the antenna connector, with the
remaining antenna connector(s) being terminated. If the manufacturer has
declared the transmitter paths to be equivalent, it is sufficient to
measure the signal at any one of the transmitter antenna connectors.

### 4.6.7 BS with integrated Iuant BS modem

Unless otherwise stated, for the tests in the present document, the
integrated Iuant BS modem shall be switched off. Spurious emissions
according to clauses 6.5.3 and 7.7 shall be measured only for
frequencies above 20MHz with the integrated Iuant BS modem switched on.

### 4.6.8 BS with Virtual Antenna Mapping

A BS may be configured with virtual antenna mapping (VAM) as shown as
example in Figure 4.3 for MIMO mode with two transmit antennas. The
purpose of VAM is to achieve the goal of power balancing of physical
channels across the multiple physical antennas when MIMO mode with two
or four transmit antennas is is deployed in the downlink. Since the
non-MIMO channels are transmitted only via virtual antenna 1, the
transmission powers are not balanced at point a. The VAM function
transforms the input signals at point a to output signals at point b
such that the transmission powers are balanced.

In the following some characteristics of VAM are described in the
context of MIMO mode with two transmit antennas. Similar characteristics
apply also when VAM is implemented in the context of MIMO mode with four
transmit antennas.

Some characteristics of VAM are as follows:

\- The VAM can be represented by a unitary matrix

\- The same pair of weights (s~1~,s~2~) are applied to each physical
channel that appears at virtual antenna port 1

\- The same pair of weights (s~3~,s~4~) are applied to each physical
channel that appears at virtual antenna port 2

\- The VAM weights (s~1~,s~2~,s~3~,s~4~) should satisfy the following
condition for MIMO and non-MIMO channels :

\- Power balancing at the output of VAM is achieved by setting

\- The VAM function is implemented in the digital domain prior to
digital to analog conversion.

Figure 4.3: Example of VAM for MIMO mode with two transmit antennas.

If NodeB manufacturer declares the implementation of a Virtual Antenna
Mapping (VAM), then the S-CPICH power accuracy test in section 6.2.3
will not be performed.

4.12 Test configuration for multi-carrier operations
----------------------------------------------------

The test configurations shall be constructed using the methods defined
below, subject to the parameters declared by the manufacturer for the
supported RF configurations as listed in subclause 4.11.6. The test
configurations to use for conformance testing are defined for each
supported RF configuration in subclause 4.12.4

The applicable Test Models for generation of the carrier transmit test
signal are defined in subclause 6.1.1.

### 4.12.1 UTC1: Contiguous spectrum operation test configuration

The purpose of the UTC1 is to test both BS transmitter and receiver
requirements. UTC1 should be constructed using the following method:

\- The Base Station RF Bandwidth shall be the declared maximum Base
Station RF Bandwidth for contiguous operation.

\- Place one UTRA FDD carrier adjacent to the upper Base Station RF
Bandwidth edge and one UTRA FDD carrier adjacent to the lower Base
Station RF Bandwidth edge. The specified F~Offset~ shall apply.

\- For transmitter tests, alternately place a UTRA FDD carrier adjacent
to the already placed carriers at the low and high Base Station RF
Bandwidth edges until there is no more space to fit a carrier or the BS
does not support more carriers. The nominal carrier spacing defined in
subclause 3.5.1 shall apply.

\- The carrier(s) may be shifted maximum 100 kHz towards lower
frequencies for B~RFBW~ and M~RFBW~ and towards higher frequencies for
T~RFBW~ to align with the channel raster.

#### 4.12.1.1 UTC1 power allocation

Set the power of each carrier to the same level so that the sum of the
carrier powers equals the rated total output power (Prated,t) according
to the manufacturer's declaration in sub clause 4.11.6.

### 4.12.2 UTC2: Non-contiguous spectrum operation test configuration

The purpose of the UTC2 is to test both the BS transmitter and receiver
requirements. UTC2 should be constructed using the following method:

\- The Base Station RF Bandwidth shall be the maximum Base Station RF
Bandwidth for non-contiguous operation. The Base Station RF Bandwidth
consists of one sub-block gap and two sub-blocks located at the edges of
the declared maximum Base Station RF Bandwidth.

\- For transmitter tests, place one UTRA FDD carrier adjacent to the
upper Base Station RF Bandwidth edge and one UTRA FDD carrier adjacent
to the lower Base Station RF Bandwidth edge. The specified F~Offset~
shall apply.

\- For receiver tests, place one UTRA carrier adjacent to the upper Base
Station RF Bandwidth edge and one UTRA carrier adjacent to the lower
Base Station RF Bandwidth edge. If the supported maximum Base Station RF
Bandwidth is at least 35 MHz and the BS supports at least 4 UTRA FDD
carriers, place a UTRA FDD carrier adjacent to each already placed
carrier for each sub-block. The nominal carrier spacing defined in
subclause 3.5.1 shall apply.

\- The sub-block edges adjacent to the sub-block gap shall be determined
using the specified F~Offset~ for the carrier adjacent to the sub-block
gap.

\- The UTRA FDD carrier in the lower sub-block may be shifted maximum100
kHz towards lower frequencies and the UTRA FDD carrier in the upper
sub-block may be shifted maximum100 kHz towards higher frequencies to
align with the channel raster.

#### 4.12.2.1 UTC2 power allocation

Set the power of each carrier to the same power so that the sum of the
carrier powers equals the rated total output power (Prated,t) according
to the manufacturer's declaration in subclause 4.11.6.

### 4.12.3 Multi-band operation test configurations

#### 4.12.3.1 UTC3: Multi-band test configuration for full carrier allocation

The purpose of UTC3 is to test multi-band operation aspects considering
maximum supported number of carriers.

UTC3 is based on re-using the existing test configuration applicable per
band involved in multi-band operation. It is constructed using the
following method:

\- The Base Station RF Bandwidth of each supported operating band shall
be the declared maximum Base Station RF Bandwidth of each supported
operating band in multi-band operation.

\- The number of carriers of each supported operating band shall be the
declared maximum number of supported carriers in multi-band operation.
Carriers shall first be placed at the outermost edges of the declared
Maximum Radio Bandwidth. Additional carriers shall next be placed at the
edges of the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges, if possible.

\- The allocated Base Station RF Bandwidth of the outermost bands shall
be located at the outermost edges of the declared Maximum Radio
Bandwidth.

\- Each concerned band shall be considered as an independent band and
the carrier placement in each band shall be according to UTC1, where the
declared parameters for multi-band operation shall apply.

\- If a multi-band BS supports three carriers only, two carriers shall
be placed in one band according to UTC1 while the remaining carrier
shall be placed at the edge of the Maximum Radio Bandwidth in the other
band.

\- If the sum of the maximum Base Station RF Bandwidth of each supported
operating bands is larger than the declared Total RF Bandwidth BW~tot~
of transmitter and receiver for the declared band combinations of the
BS, repeat the steps above for test configurations where the Base
Station RF Bandwidth of one of the operating band shall be reduced so
that the Total RF Bandwidth BW~tot~ of transmitter and receiver is not
exceeded and vice versa.

\- If the sum of the maximum number of supported carrier of each
supported operating bands in multi-band operation is larger than the
declared total number of supported carriers for the declared band
combinations of the BS, repeat the steps above for test configurations
where in each test configuration the number of carriers of one of the
operating band shall be reduced so that the total number of supported
carriers is not exceeded and vice versa.

##### 4.12.3.1.1 UTC3 power allocation

Unless otherwise stated, set the power of each carrier in all supported
operating bands to the same power so that the sum of the carrier powers
equals the total output power, according to the manufacturer's
declaration.

If the allocated power of a supported operating band(s) exceeds the
declared Prated,t of the operating band(s) in multi-band operation, the
exceeded part shall, if possible, be reallocated into the other band(s).
If the power allocated for a carrier exceeds the declared Prated,c for
that carrier, the exceeded power shall, if possible, be reallocated into
the other carriers.

#### 4.12.3.2 UTC4: Multi-band test configuration with high PSD per carrier

The purpose of UTC4 is to test multi-band operation aspects considering
higher PSD cases with reduced number of carriers and non-contiguous
operation (if supported) in multi-band mode.

ETC4 is based on re-using the existing test configuration applicable per
band involved in multi-band operation. It is constructed using the
following method:

\- The Base Station RF Bandwidth of each supported operating band shall
be the declared maximum Base Station RF Bandwidth in multi-band
operation.

\- The allocated Base Station RF Bandwidth of the outermost bands shall
be located at the outermost edges of the declared Maximum Radio
Bandwidth.

\- The maximum number of carriers is limited to two per band. Carriers
shall first be placed at the outermost edges of the declared Maximum
Radio Bandwidth. Additional carriers shall next be placed at the Base
Station RF Bandwidth edges, if possible.

\- Each concerned band shall be considered as an independent band and
the carrier placement in each band shall be according to UTC2, where the
declared parameters for multi-band operation shall apply.

\- If a multi-band BS supports three carriers only, two carriers shall
be placed in one band according to UTC2 while the remaining carrier
shall be placed at the edge of the Maximum Radio Bandwidth in the other
band.

\- If the sum of the maximum Base Station RF Bandwidth of each supported
operating bands is larger than the declared Total RF Bandwidth BW~tot~
of transmitter and receiver for the declared band combinations of the
BS, repeat the steps above for test configurations where the Base
Station RF Bandwidth of one of the operating band shall be reduced so
that the Total RF Bandwidth BW~tot~ of transmitter and receiver is not
exceeded and vice versa.

##### 4.12.3.2.1 UTC4 power allocation

Unless otherwise stated, set the power of each carrier in all supported
operating bands to the same power so that the sum of the carrier powers
equals the total output power, according to manufacturer's declaration.

If the allocated power of a supported operating band(s) exceeds the
declared Prated,t of the operating band(s) in multi-band operation, the
exceeded part shall, if possible, be reallocated into the other band(s).
If the power allocated for a carrier exceeds the declared Prated,c for
that carrier, the exceeded power shall, if possible, be reallocated into
the other carriers.

### 4.12.4 Applicability of test configurations

The present subclause defines for each RF test requirement the set of
mandatory test configurations which shall be used for demonstrating
conformance. The applicable test configurations are specified in the
tables below for each the supported RF configuration, which shall be
declared according to subclause 4.11.6. The generation and power
allocation for each test configuration is defined in subclauses 4.12.1
to 4.12.3.

For a BS declared to be capable of single carrier operation only, a
single carrier (SC) shall be used for testing.

For a BS declared to be capable of multi-carrier operation in contiguous
spectrum operation in single band only, the test configurations in
Table 4.6 shall be used for testing.

4.13 Requirements for BS capable of multi-band operation
--------------------------------------------------------

For BS capable of multi-band operation, the RF requirements in clause 6
and 7 apply for each supported operating band unless otherwise stated.
For some requirements it is explicitly stated that specific additions or
exclusions to the requirement apply for BS capable of multi-band
operation.

For BS capable of multi-band operation, various structures in terms of
combinations of different transmitter and receiver implementations
(multi-band or single band) with mapping of transceivers to one or more
antenna port(s) in different ways are possible. In the case where
multiple bands are mapped on separate antenna connectors, the following
applies:

\- Single-band transmitter spurious emissions, spectrum emission mask,
ACLR, transmitter intermodulation and receiver spurious emissions
requirements apply to each antenna connector.

\- If the BS is configured for single-band operation, single-band
requirements shall apply to the antenna connector configured for
single-band operation and no exclusions or provisions for multi-band
capable BS are applicable. Single-band requirements are tested
separately at the antenna connector configured for single-band
operation, with all other antenna connectors terminated.

5 Format and interpretation of tests
====================================

Each test in the following clauses has a standard format:

**X Title**

All tests are applicable to all equipment within the scope of the
present document, unless otherwise stated.

**X.1 Definition and applicability**

This clause gives the general definition of the parameter under
consideration and specifies whether the test is applicable to all
equipment or only to a certain subset.

**X.2 Minimum Requirement**

This clause contains the reference to the clause to the 3GPP reference
(or core) specification which defines the Minimum Requirement.

**X.3 Test purpose**

This clause defines the purpose of the test.

**X.4 Method of test**

> **X.4.1 Initial conditions**

This clause defines the initial conditions for each test, including the
test environment, the RF channels to be tested and the basic measurement
set-up.

> **X.4.2 Procedure**

This clause describes the steps necessary to perform the test and
provides further details of the test definition like point of access
(e.g. antenna port), domain (e.g. frequency-span), range, weighting
(e.g. bandwidth), and algorithms (e.g. averaging).

**X.5 Test Requirement**

This clause defines the pass/fail criteria for the equipment under test.
See clause 4.3 Interpretation of measurement results.

6 Transmitter
=============

6.1 General
-----------

Unless otherwise stated, the requirements in clause 6 are expressed for
a single transmitter antenna connector. In case of transmit diversity,
DB-DC-HSDPA or MIMO transmission, the requirements apply for each
transmitter antenna connector.

A BS supporting DC-HSDPA and DB-DC-HSDPA transmits two cells
simultaneously. A BS supporting DC-HSDPA transmits two cells
simultaneously on adjacent carrier frequencies.

Unless otherwise stated, all tests in this clause shall be performed at
the BS antenna connector (test port A) with a full complement of
transceivers for the configuration in normal operating conditions. If
any external apparatus such as a TX amplifier, a filter or the
combination of such devices is used, the tests according to clauses
4.6.2 and/or 4.6.4, depending on the device added, shall be performed to
ensure that the requirements are met at test port B.

Figure 6.1: Transmitter test ports

Power levels are expressed in dBm.

### 6.1.1 Test Models

The set-up of physical channels for transmitter tests shall be according
to one of the Test Models below. A reference to the applicable table is
made with each test.

For Tx diversity transmission, the same Test Model shall be used for
both antennas. No diversity coding of the Test Models is required.

A code \"level setting\" of -X dB is the setting that according to the
base station manufacturer will result in a code domain power of
nominally X dB below the maximum output power. The relative accuracy of
the code domain power to the maximum output power shall have tolerance
of ±1 dB.

#### 6.1.1.1 Test Model 1 -- TM1

This model shall be used for tests on:

\- occupied bandwidth;

\- spectrum emission mask;

\- ACLR;

\- spurious emissions;

\- transmit intermodulation;

\- base station maximum output power.

\- Total power dynamic range (at Pmax,c)

\- Home base station output power for adjacent channel protection

\- Frequency error (at Pmax,c)

\- IPDL time mask

Due to the amplitude statistics of TM1 \[2\], it is sufficient to test
all requirements above with TM1 regardless of the modulation schemes
supported by the Node-B.

In addition, the test model is used for Error Vector Magnitude using
QPSK modulation (at Pmax,c).

64 DPCHs at 30 ksps (SF=128) are distributed randomly across the code
space, at random power levels and random timing offsets are defined so
as to simulate a realistic traffic scenario which may have high PAR
(Peak to Average Ratio).

Considering that not every base station implementation will support 64
DPCH, variants of this test model containing 32 and 16 DPCH are also
specified. For Home base station, additional options of this test model
containing 8 and 4 DPCH are also specified. The conformance test shall
be performed using the largest of these options that can be supported by
the equipment under test.

\"Fraction of power\" is relative to the maximum output power on the TX
antenna interface under test.

As with TM1, not every base station implementation will support 32 DPCH,
a variant of this test model containing 16 DPCH are also specified. For
Home base station, additional options of this test model containing 8
and 4 DPCH are also specified. The conformance test shall be performed
using the larger of these options that can be supported by the equipment
under test.

#### 6.1.1.4A Test Model 5 -- TM5

This model shall be used for tests on:

\- EVM for base stations supporting HS-PDSCH transmission using 16QAM
modulation (at Pmax,c)

Considering that not every base station implementation will support 8
HS-PDSCH + 30 DPCH, variants of this test model containing 4 HS-PDSCH +
14 DPCH and 2 HS-PDSCH + 6 DPCH are also specified. For Home base
station, an additional option of this test model containing 4 HS-PDSCH +
4 DPCH is also specified. The conformance test shall be performed using
the largest of these options that can be supported by the equipment
under test, where the largest is firstly determined by the number of
HS-PDSCH and then by the number of DPCH.

Each HS-PDSCH is modulated by 16QAM.

#### 6.1.1.4B Test Model 6 -- TM6

This model shall be used for tests on:

\- Relative CDE for base stations supporting HS-PDSCH transmission using
64QAM modulation

For Home base station, an additional option of this test model
containing 4 HS-PDSCH + 4 DPCH is also specified. The conformance test
shall be performed using the larger option that can be supported by the
Home base station under test.

Each HS-PDSCH is modulated by 64QAM.

#### 6.1.1.5 DPCH Structure of the Downlink Test Models

For the above test models the following structure is adopted for the
DPCH. The DPDCH and DPCCH have the same power level. The timeslot
structure should be as described by TS 25.211-slot format 10 and 6 that
are reproduced in table 6.7.

over 15 timeslots according to the relevant columns of TS 25.211, which
are reproduced in table 6.8.

The TPC bits alternate 00 / 11 starting with 00 in timeslot 0.

The aggregate 15 x 30 = 450 DPDCH bits per frame are filled with a PN9
sequence generated using the primitive trinomial . In case there are
less data bits/frame needed then the first bits of the aggregate shall
be selected. To ensure non-correlation of the PN9 sequences, each DPDCH
shall use its channelization code as the seed for the PN sequence at the
start of each frame, according to its timing offset.

The sequence shall be generated in a nine-stage shift register whose
5^th^ and 9^th^ stage outputs are added in a modulo‑two addition stage,
and the result is fed back to the input of the first stage. The
generator shall be seeded so that the sequence begins with the
channelization code starting from the LSB, and followed by 2 consecutive
ONEs for SF=128 and 1 consecutive ONE for SF=256.

Figure 6.2

#### 6.1.1.6 Common channel Structure of the Downlink Test Models

##### 6.1.1.6.1 P-CCPCH

The aggregate 15 x 18 = 270 P-CCPCH bits per frame are filled with a PN9
sequence generated using the primitive trinomial . Channelization code
of the P-CCPCH is used as the seed for the PN sequence at the start of
each frame.

The generator shall be seeded so that the sequence begins with the 8 bit
channelization code starting from the LSB, and followed by a ONE.

##### 6.1.1.6.2 PICH

PICH carries 18 Paging Indicators (Pq) sent in the following sequence
from left to right \[1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0\]. This defines
the 288 first bits of the PICH. No power is transmitted for the 12
remaining unused bits.

##### 6.1.1.6.3 Primary scrambling code and SCH

The scrambling code should be 0.

Where multiple repetitions of the Test Model signals are being used to
simulate a multi-carrier signal the scrambling code for the lower
frequency is 0. Carriers added at successively higher frequencies use
codes 1, 2,\... and their frame structures are time offset by 1/5,
2/5\... of a time slot duration.

The scrambling code defines the SSC sequence of the secondary SCH. In
their active part, primary and secondary SCH share equally the power
level defined for \"PCCPCH+SCH\".

##### 6.1.1.6.4 S-CCPCH containing PCH

The aggregate 15 x 20 = 300 S-CCPCH bits per frame are used. Data bits
are filled with a PN9 sequence generated using the primitive trinomial .
In case there are less data bits/frame needed then the first bits of the
aggregate shall be selected.. Channelization code of the S-CCPCH is used
as the seed for the PN sequence at the start of each frame. For test
purposes, any one of the four possible slot formats 0,1, 2 and 3 can be
supported. The support for all four slot formats is not needed..

The generator shall be seeded so that the sequence begins with the 8 bit
channelization code starting from the LSB, and followed by a ONE. The
test on S-CCPCH has a frame structure so that the pilot bits are defined
over 15 timeslots to the relevant columns of TS 25.211. The TFCI bits
are filled with ONEs whenever needed.

#### 6.1.1.7 HS-PDSCH Structure of the Downlink TM5

There are 640 bits per slot in a 16QAM-modulated HS-PDSCH. The aggregate
15 x 640 = 9600 bits per frame are filled with repetitions of a PN9
sequence generated using the primitive trinomial . To ensure
non-correlation of the PN9 sequences, each HS-PDSCH shall use its
channelization code multiplied by 23 as the seed for the PN sequence at
the start of each frame.

The generator shall be seeded so that the sequence begins with the
channelization code multiplied by 23 starting from the LSB.

Figure 6.2

#### 6.1.1.8 HS-SCCH Structure of the Downlink Test Models 5 and 6

There are 40 bits per time slot in a HS-SCCH. The aggregate 15 x 40 =
600 bits per frame are filled with repetitions of a PN9 sequence
generated using the primitive trinomial . Channelization code of the
HS-SCCH is used as the seed for the PN sequence at the start of each
frame. The generator shall be seeded so that the sequence begins with
the channelization code starting from the LSB, and followed by 2
consecutive ONEs.

#### 6.1.1.9 HS-PDSCH Structure of the Downlink TM6

There are 960 bits per slot in a 64QAM-modulated HS-PDSCH. The aggregate
15 x 960 = 14400 bits per frame are filled with repetitions of a PN9
sequence generated using the primitive trinomial . To ensure
non-correlation of the PN9 sequences, each HS-PDSCH shall use its
channelization code multiplied by 23 as the seed for the PN sequence at
the start of each frame.

The generator shall be seeded so that the sequence begins with the
channelization code multiplied by 23 starting from the LSB.

### 6.4.6 Home base station output power for adjacent channel protection

#### 6.4.6.1 Definition and applicability

The Home BS shall be capable of adjusting the transmitter output power
to minimize the interference level on the adjacent channels licensed to
other operators in the same geographical area while optimize the Home BS
coverage. These requirements are only applicable to Home BS. The
requirements in this clause are applicable for AWGN radio propagation
conditions.

The output power, Pout, of the Home BS shall be as specified in Table
6.13A under the following input conditions:

\- CPICH Êc, measured in dBm, is the code power of the Primary CPICH on
one of the adjacent channels presented at the Home BS antenna connector
for the CPICH received on the adjacent channels. If Tx diversity is
applied on the Primary CPICH, CPICH Êc shall be the sum in \[W\] of the
code powers of the Primary CPICH transmitted from each antenna.

\- Ioh, measured in dBm, is the total received power density, including
signals and interference but excluding the own Home BS signal, presented
at the Home BS antenna connector on the Home BS operating channel.

In case that both adjacent channels are licensed to other operators, the
most stringent requirement shall apply for Pout. In case the Home BS's
operating channel and both adjacent channels are licensed to the same
operator, the requirements of this clause do not apply.

The input conditions defined for the requirements in this section are
specified at the antenna connector of the Home BS. For Home BS receivers
with diversity, the requirements apply to each antenna connector
separately, with the other one(s) terminated or disabled .The
requirements are otherwise unchanged. For Home BS(s) without measurement
capability, a reference antenna with a gain of 0 dBi is assumed for
converting these power levels into field strength requirements.

given in Annex F.

6.5 Output RF spectrum emissions
--------------------------------

The physical channels for the following test(s) shall be set-up
according to clause 6.1.1.1.

### 6.5.1 Occupied bandwidth

#### 6.5.1.1 Definition and applicability

The occupied bandwidth is the width of a frequency band such that, below
the lower and above the upper frequency limits, the mean powers emitted
are each equal to a specified percentage β/2 of the total mean
transmitted power.

The value of β/2 shall be taken as 0,5%.

#### 6.5.1.2 Minimum Requirements

The minimum requirement is in TS 25.104 \[1\] clause 6.6.1.1.

#### 6.5.1.3 Test purpose

The occupied bandwidth, defined in the Radio Regulations of the
International Telecommunication Union ITU, is a useful concept for
specifying the spectral properties of a given emission in the simplest
possible manner; see also ITU-R Recommendation SM.328 \[11\]. The test
purpose is to verify that the emission of the BS does not occupy an
excessive bandwidth for the service to be provided and is, therefore,
not likely to create interference to other users of the spectrum beyond
undue limits.

#### 6.5.1.4 Method of test

##### 6.5.1.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clause 4.4.1.

RF channels to be tested: B, M and T; see clause 4.8

1\) Connect the Measurement device to the BS antenna connector.

2\) Set the BS to transmit a signal in accordance to TM1, clause
6.1.1.1, at manufacturer's declared rated output power, Prated,c.

##### 6.5.1.4.2 Procedure

1\) Measure the spectrum of the transmitted signal across a span of 10
MHz, based on an occupied bandwidth requirement of 5 MHz. The selected
resolution bandwidth (RBW) filter of the analyser shall be 30 kHz or
less. The spectrum shall be measured at 400 or more points across the
measurement span.

NOTE: The detection mode of the spectrum analyzer will not have any
effect on the result if the statistical properties of the out-of-OBW
power are the same as those of the inside-OBW power. Both are expected
to have the Rayleigh distribution of the amplitude of Gaussian noise. In
any case where the statistics are not the same, though, the detection
mode must be power responding. There are at least two ways to be power
responding. The spectrum analyser can be set to \"sample\" detection,
with its video bandwidth setting at least three times its RBW setting.
Or the analyser may be set to respond to the average of the power
(root-mean-square of the voltage) across the measurement cell.

2\) Compute the total of the power, P0, (in power units, not decibel
units) of all the measurement cells in the measurement span. Compute P1,
the power outside the occupied bandwidth on each side. P1 is half of the
total power outside the bandwidth. P1 is half of (100 % - (occupied
percentage)) of P0. For the occupied percentage of 99 %, P1 is 0.005
times P0.

3\) Determine the lowest frequency, f1, for which the sum of all power
in the measurement cells from the beginning of the span to f1 exceeds
P1.

4\) Determine the highest frequency, f2, for which the sum of all power
in the measurement cells from the end of the span to f2 exceeds P1.

5\) Compute the occupied bandwidth as f2 - f1.

In addition, for a multi-band capable BS, the following step shall
apply:

6\) For multi-band capable BS and single band tests, repeat the steps
above per involved band where single carrier test models shall apply
with no carrier activated in the other band. For multi-band capable BS
with separate antenna connector, the antenna connector not being under
test shall be terminated.

#### 6.5.1.5 Test requirements

The occupied bandwidth shall be less than 5 MHz based on a chip rate of
3,84 Mcps

NOTE: If the above Test Requirement differs from the Minimum Requirement
then the Test Tolerance applied for this test is non-zero. The Test
Tolerance for this test is defined in clause 4.2 and the explanation of
how the Minimum Requirement has been relaxed by the Test Tolerance is
given in Annex F.

### 6.5.2 Out of band emission

Out of band emissions are unwanted emissions immediately outside the
channel bandwidth resulting from the modulation process and
non-linearity in the transmitter but excluding spurious emissions. This
out of band emission limit is specified in terms of a spectrum emission
mask and adjacent channel leakage power ratio for the transmitter.

#### 6.5.2.1 Spectrum emission mask

##### 6.5.2.1.1 Definitions and applicability

The mask defined in Tables 6.18 to 6.21 below may be mandatory in
certain regions. In other regions this mask may not be applied.

For regions where this clause applies, the requirement shall be met
whatever the type of transmitter considered (single carrier or
multi-carrier). In addition, for a BS operating in non-contiguous
spectrum, the requirements apply inside any sub-block gap. In addition,
for a BS capable of multi-band operation, the requirements apply inside
any Inter RF Bandwidth gap.

For BS capable of multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped
on separate antenna connectors, the single-band requirements apply and
the cumulative evaluation of the emission limit in the Inter RF
Bandwidth gap are not applicable.

##### 6.5.2.1.2 Minimum Requirements

The minimum requirement is in TS 25.104 \[1\] clause 6.6.2.1.

Table 6.14: (void)

Table 6.15: (void)

Table 6.16: (void)

Table 6.17: (void)

##### 6.5.2.1.3 Test purpose

This test measures the emissions of the BS, close to the assigned
channel bandwidth of the wanted signal, while the transmitter is in
operation.

##### 6.5.2.1.4 Method of test

###### 6.5.2.1.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clause 4.4.1.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: B, M and T; see clause 4.8

Base Station RF Bandwidth positions to be tested for multi-carrier:
B~RFBW~, M~RFBW~ and T~RFBW~ in single band operation; B~RFBW~\_T'~RFBW~
and B'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ in multi-band operation; see subclause 4.8.1.

1\) Set-up the equipment as shown in annex B.\
As a general rule, the resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment
should be equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to improve
measurement accuracy, sensitivity, efficiency and avoiding e.g. carrier
leakage, the resolution bandwidth may be smaller than the measurement
bandwidth. When the resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement
bandwidth, the result should be integrated over the measurement
bandwidth in order to obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the
measurement bandwidth.

2\) Measurements with an offset from the carrier centre frequency
between 2,515 MHz and 4.0 MHz shall use a 30 kHz measurement bandwidth.

3\) Measurements with an offset from the carrier centre frequency
between 4.0 MHz and (f\_offset~max~ - 500 kHz).shall use a 1 MHz
measurement bandwidth.

4\) Detection mode: True RMS.

##### 6.5.2.1.4.2 Procedures

1\) For a BS declared to be capable of single carrier operation only,
set the base station to transmit a signal according to TM1, clause
6.1.1.1, at manufacturer's declared rated output power, Prated,c.

For a BS declared to be capable of multi-carrier operation, set the base
station to transmit according to TM1 on all carriers configured using
the applicable test configuration and corresponding power setting
specified in sub-clause 4.12.

2\) Step the centre frequency of the measurement filter in contiguous
steps and measure the emission within the specified frequency ranges
with the specified measurement bandwidth. For BS operating in multiple
bands or non-contiguous spectrum, the emission within the Inter RF
Bandwidth or sub-block gap shall be measured using the specified
measurement bandwidth from the closest RF Bandwidth or sub block edge.

In addition, for a multi-band capable BS, the following step shall
apply:

3\) For multi-band capable BS and single band tests, repeat the steps
above per involved band where single band test configurations and test
models shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band. For
multi-band capable BS with separate antenna connector, the antenna
connector not being under test in case of single-band or multi-band test
shall be terminated.

##### 6.5.2.1.5 Test requirements

The measurement results in step 2 of 6.5.2.1.4.2 shall not exceed the
test requirements specified in tables 6.18 to 6.21 for the appropriate
BS rated output power, where:

\- ∆f is the separation between the carrier frequency and the nominal
-3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to the carrier frequency.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the carrier frequency and the
centre of the measurement filter;

\- f\_offset~max~ is either 12.5 MHz or the offset to the UMTS Tx band
edge as defined in clause 3.4.1, whichever is the greater.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

Inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gaps with Wgap \< 20 MHz for BS operating
in multiple bands, emissions shall not exceed the cumulative sum of the
test requirements specified at the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges on
each side of the Inter RF Bandwidth gap. The test requirement for Base
Station RF Bandwidth edge is specified in Tables 6.18 to 6.21E below,
where in this case:

\- ∆f is equal to 2.5MHz plus the separation between the Base Station RF
Bandwidth edge frequency and the nominal -3dB point of the measuring
filter closest to the Base Station RF Bandwidth edge.

\- f\_offset is equal to 2.5MHz plus the separation between the Base
Station RF Bandwidth edge frequency and the centre of the measuring
filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is either 12.5 MHz or the offset to the UMTS Tx band
edge as defined in section 5.2, whichever is the greater.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

For BS capable of multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped
on the same antenna connector, the operating band unwanted emission
limits apply also in a supported operating band without any carrier
transmitted, in the case where there are carrier(s) transmitted in
another supported operating band. In this case, no cumulative limit is
applied in the inter-band gap between a supported downlink operating
band with carrier(s) transmitted and a supported downlink operating band
without any carrier transmitted and

\- In case the inter-band gap between a downlink band with carrier(s)
transmitted and a downlink band without any carrier transmitted is less
than 20MHz, f\_offset~max~ shall be the offset to the frequency 10 MHz
outside the outermost edges of the two downlink operating bands and the
operating band unwanted emission limit of the band where there are
carriers transmitted, as defined in the tables of the present subclause,
shall apply across both downlink bands.

\- In other cases, the operating band unwanted emission limit of the
band where there are carriers transmitted, as defined in the tables of
the present subclause for the largest frequency offset (∆f~max~), shall
apply from 10 MHz below the lowest frequency, up to 10 MHz above the
highest frequency of the downlink operating band without any carrier
transmitted.

Inside any sub-block gap for a BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum,
the measurement results shall not exceed the cumulative sum of the test
requirements specified for the adjacent sub blocks on each side of the
sub block gap. The test requirement for each sub block is specified in
Tables 6.18 to 6.21E below, where in this case:

\- ∆f is equal to 2.5MHz plus the separation between the sub block edge
frequency and the nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to
the sub block edge.

\- f\_offset is equal to 2.5MHz plus the separation between the sub
block edge frequency and the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is equal to the sub block gap bandwidth minus half of
the bandwidth of the measuring filter plus 2.5MHz.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

NOTE: If the above Test Requirement differs from the Minimum Requirement
then the Test Tolerance applied for this test is non-zero. The Test
Tolerance for this test is defined in clause 4.2 and the explanation of
how the Minimum Requirement has been relaxed by the Test Tolerance is
given in Annex F.

In certain regions the following requirement may apply for protection of
DTT. For UTRA BS operating in Band XX, the level of emissions in the

NOTE: The regional requirement is defined in terms of EIRP (effective
isotropic radiated power), which is dependent on both the BS emissions
at the antenna connector and the deployment (including antenna gain and
feeder loss). The requirement defined above provides the characteristics
of the basestation needed to verify compliance with the regional
requirement. Compliance with the regional requirement can be determined
using the method outlined in Annex D of \[1\].

In certain regions, the following requirements may apply to UTRA BS
operating in Band XXXII within 1452-1492 MHz. The level of unwanted

NOTE: The regional requirement, included in \[17\], is defined in terms
of EIRP per antenna, which is dependent on both the BS emissions at the
antenna connector and the deployment (including antenna gain and feeder
loss). The requirement defined above provides the characteristics of the
base station needed to verify compliance with the regional requirement.
The assessment of the EIRP level is described in Annex H of TS36.104
\[15\].

In certain regions, the following requirement may apply to UTRA BS
operating in Band XXXII within 1452-1492MHz for the protection of
services in spectrum adjacent to the frequency range 1452-1492 MHz. The
level of emissions, measured on centre frequencies F~filter~ with filter
bandwidth according to Table 6.21H, shall neither exceed the maximum
emission level P~EM,B32,d~ nor P~EM,B32,e~ declared by the manufacturer.
This requirement applies in the frequency range 1429-1518MHz even though
part of the range falls in the spurious domain.

The requirement defined above provides the characteristics of the base
station needed to verify compliance with the regional requirement. The
assessment of the EIRP level is described in Annex H of TS36.104 \[15\].

Notes for the Tables in this subclause:

NOTE 3: This frequency range ensures that the range of values of
f\_offset is continuous.

NOTE 4: As a general rule, the resolution bandwidth of the measuring
equipment should be equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to
improve measurement accuracy, sensitivity and efficiency, the resolution
bandwidth can be smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When the
resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the
result should be integrated over the measurement bandwidth in order to
obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.

#### 6.5.2.2 Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR)

##### 6.5.2.2.1 Definition and applicability

Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR) is the ratio of the RRC
filtered mean power centred on the assigned channel frequency to the RRC
filtered mean power centred on an adjacent channel frequency.

The requirements shall apply outside the Base Station RF Bandwidth or
Maximum Radio Bandwidth whatever the type of transmitter considered
(single carrier or multi-carrier) and for all transmission modes
foreseen by the manufacturer\'s specification.

For a BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum, ACLR requirement also
applies for the first adjacent channel, inside any sub-block gap with a
gap size W~gap~ ≥ 15 MHz. The ACLR requirement for the second adjacent
channel applies inside any sub-block gap with a gap size W~gap~ ≥ 20
MHz. The CACLR requirement in subclause 6.5.2.2.2 applies in sub block
gaps for the frequency ranges defined in Table 6.23B.

For a BS operating in multiple bands, where multiple bands are mapped
onto the same antenna connector, ACLR requirement also applies for the

The following test requirement applies for a BS operating in
non-contiguous spectrum or multiple bands.

The following requirement applies for the gap sizes listed in Table
6.23B,

\- inside a sub-block gap within an operating band for a BS operating in
non-contiguous spectrum;

\- inside an Inter RF Bandwidth gap for a BS capable of multi-band
operation, where multiple bands are mapped on the same antenna
connector.

The Cumulative Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (CACLR) in a
sub-block gap or Inter RF Bandwidth gap is the ratio of

a\) the sum of the filtered mean power centred on the assigned channel
frequencies for the two carriers adjacent to each side of the sub-block
gap or Inter RF Bandwidth gap, and

b\) the filtered mean power centred on a frequency channel adjacent to
one of the respective sub-block edges or Base Station RF Bandwidth
edges.

The assumed filter for the adjacent channel frequency is defined in
Table 6.23B and the filters on the assigned channels are defined in
Table 6.23C.

For Wide Area Category A BS, either the CACLR limits in Table 6.23B or
the absolute limit of -13dBm/MHz shall apply, whichever is less
stringent.

For Wide Area Category B BS, either the CACLR limits in Table 6.23B or
the absolute limit of -15dBm/MHz shall apply, whichever is less
stringent.

For Medium Range BS, either the CACLR limits in Table 6.23B or the
absolute limit of -25 dBm/MHz shall apply, whichever is less stringent.

For Local Area BS, either the CACLR limits in Table 6.23B or the
absolute limit of -32 dBm/MHz shall apply, whichever is less stringent.

The CACLR for UTRA carriers located on either side of the sub-block gap
or Inter RF Bandwidth gap shall be higher than the value specified in
Table 6.23B.

### 6.5.3 Spurious emissions

#### 6.5.3.1 Definition and applicability

Spurious emissions are emissions which are caused by unwanted
transmitter effects such as harmonics emission, parasitic emission,
intermodulation products and frequency conversion products, but exclude
out of band emissions. This is measured at the base station antenna
connector.

The requirements (except 6.5.3.7.6 and 6.5.3.7.9 and specifically stated
exceptions in Table 6.38) apply at frequencies within the specified
frequency ranges, which are more than 12.5 MHz under the first carrier
frequency used or more than 12.5 MHz above the last carrier frequency
used.

The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered
(single carrier or multi-carrier) and for all transmission modes
foreseen by the manufacturer\'s specification.

For BS capable of multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped
on the same antenna connector, the requirements (except 6.5.3.7.6 and
6.5.3.7.9 and specifically stated exceptions in Table 6.38) apply at
frequencies within the specified frequency ranges, excluding the
frequency ranges which are less than or equal to 12.5MHz below the first
carrier frequency used and less than or equal to 12.5MHz above the last
carrier frequency used for each supported operating band. For BS capable
of multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped on separate
antenna connectors, the single-band requirements apply and the
multi-band exclusions and provisions are not applicable.

Unless otherwise stated, all requirements are measured as mean power
(RMS).

attenuator or a directional coupler if necessary

2\) Measurements shall use a measurement bandwidth in accordance to the
tables in section 6.5.3.4.

3\) Detection mode: True RMS.

##### 6.5.3.6.2 Procedure

1\) For a BS declared to be capable of single carrier operation only,
set the base station to transmit a signal according to TM1, clause
6.1.1.1 at the manufacturer's declared rated output power, Prated,c.

For a BS declared to be capable of multi-carrier operation, set the base
station to transmit according to TM1 on all carriers configured using
the applicable test configuration and corresponding power setting
specified in sub-clause 4.12.

2\) Measure the emission at the specified frequencies with specified
measurement bandwidth and note that the measured value does not exceed
the specified value.

In addition, for a multi-band capable BS, the following step shall
apply:

3\) For multi-band capable BS and single band tests, repeat the steps
above per involved band where single band test configurations and test
models shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band. For
multi-band capable BS with separate antenna connector, the antenna
connector not being under test in case of single-band or multi-band test
shall be terminated.

#### 6.5.3.7 Test requirements

The measurement result in step 2 of 6.5.3.6.2 shall not exceed the
maximum level specified in tables 6.35 to 6.47 if applicable for the BS
under test.

NOTE: If a Test Requirement in this section differs from the

##### 6.5.3.7.4 Co-existence with other systems in the same geographical area

These requirements may be applied for the protection of UE, MS and/or BS
operating in other frequency bands in the same geographical area. The
requirements may apply in geographic areas in which both a UTRA FDD BS
and a system operating in another frequency band than the FDD operating
band are deployed. The system operating in the other frequency band may
be GSM, DCS, PCS, CDMA, E-UTRA, NR and/or UTRA.

The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits of Table
6.38 for a BS where requirements for co-existence with the system listed
in the first column apply. For BS capable of multi-band operation, the
exclusions and conditions in the Note column of Table 6.38 apply for
each supported operating band. For BS capable of multi-band operation
where multiple bands are mapped on separate antenna connectors, the
exclusions and conditions in the Note column of Table 6.38 apply for the
operating band supported at that antenna connector.

##### 6.5.3.7.5 Co-existence with co-located and co-sited base stations

These requirements may be applied for the protection of other BS
receivers when GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850, E-UTRA FDD and/or UTRA
FDD BS, CDMA, E-UTRA TDD, NR and or UTRA TDD are co-located with a UTRA
FDD BS.

The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits of Table
6.39 for a Wide Area (WA) BS where requirements for co-location with a
BS type listed in the first column apply. For BS capable of multi-band
operation, the exclusions and conditions in the Note column of Table
6.39 apply for each supported operating band. For BS capable of
multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped on separate antenna
connectors, the exclusions and conditions in the Note column of Table
6.39 apply for the operating band supported at that antenna connector.

The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits of Table
6.40 for a Medium Range (MR) BS where requirements for co-location with
a BS type listed in the first column apply. For BS capable of multi-band
operation, the exclusions and conditions in the Note column of Table
6.40 apply for each supported operating band. For BS capable of
multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped on separate antenna
connectors, the exclusions and conditions in the Note column of Table
6.40 apply for the operating band supported at that antenna connector.

The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits of Table
6.41 for a Local Area (LA) BS where requirements for co-location with a
BS type listed in the first column apply. For BS capable of multi-band
operation, the exclusions and conditions in the Note column of Table
6.41 apply for each supported operating band. For BS capable of
multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped on separate antenna
connectors, the exclusions and conditions in the Note column of Table
6.41 apply for the operating band supported at that antenna connector.

6.6 Transmitter intermodulation
-------------------------------

### 6.6.1 Definition and applicability

The transmitter intermodulation requirement is a measure of the
capability of the transmitter to inhibit the generation of signals in
its non-linear elements caused by presence of the wanted signal and an
interfering signal reaching the transmitter via the antenna.

The transmitter intermodulation level is the power of the
intermodulation products when a WCDMA interfering signal is injected
into an antenna connector at a power level of 30 dB lower than the rated
total output power in the operating band.

For BS capable of multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped
on separate antenna connectors, the single-band requirements apply
regardless of the interfering signals position relative to the Inter RF
Bandwidth gap.

For multi-carrier operation, the interfering signal offset is defined
relative to the lower/upper edge of the wanted signal or edge of
sub-block inside a gap.

The interfering signal frequency offset shall be as in Table 6.48.

### 6.6.2 Minimum Requirement

The minimum requirement is in TS 25.104 \[1\] clause 6.7.

### 6.6.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify the ability of the BS transmitter to
restrict the generation of intermodulation products in its non linear
elements caused by presence of the wanted signal and an interfering
signal reaching the transmitter via the antenna to below specified
levels.

### 6.6.4 Method of test

#### 6.6.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clause 4.4.1.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: B, M and T; see clause 4.8

Base Sation RF Bandwidth positions to be tested for multi-carrier:
B~RFBW~, M~RFBW~ and T~RFBW~ in single band operation; see subclause
4.8.1.

1\) Test set-up in accordance to annex B.

#### 6.6.4.2 Procedures

1\) For a BS declared to be capable of single carrier operation only,
set the base station to transmit a signal according to TM1, clause
6.1.1.1 at manufacturer's declared rated output power, Prated,c.

For a BS declared to be capable of multi-carrier operation, set the base
station to transmit according to TM1 on all carriers configured using
the applicable test configuration and corresponding power setting
specified in sub-clause 4.12.

2\) Generate the interfering signal in accordance to TM1, clause 6.1.1.1
with a frequency offset of according to the conditions of Table 6.48 but
exclude interfering signal frequencies that are outside of the allocated
downlink operating band or interfering signal frequencies that are not
completely within the sub-block gap or within the Inter RF Bandwidth
gap.

3\) Adjust ATT1 so the level of the WCDMA interfering signal is as
defined in clause 6.6.5.

4\) Perform the out of band emission test as specified in clause 6.5.2,
for all third and fifth order intermodulation products which appear in
the frequency ranges defined in clause 6.5.2. The width of the
intermodulation products shall be taken into account.

5\) Perform the spurious emission test as specified in clause 6.5.3, for
all third and fifth order intermodulation products which appear in the
frequency ranges defined in clause 6.5.3. The width of the
intermodulation products shall be taken into account.

6\) Verify that the emission level does not exceed the required level
with the exception of interfering signal frequencies.

7\) Repeat the test for the remaining interfering signal centre
frequency offsets according to the conditions of Table 6.48.

In addition, for a multi-band capable BS, the following step shall
apply:

8\) For multi-band capable BS and single band tests, repeat the steps
above per involved band where single band test configurations and test
models shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band. For
multi-band capable BS with separate antenna connector, the antenna
connector not being under test shall be terminated.

NOTE: The third order intermodulation products are (F1±2F2) and
(2F1±F2), the fifth order intermodulation products are (2F1±3F2),
(3F1±2F2), (4F1±F2), and (F1±4F2), where F1 represents the wanted signal
centre frequenyc or centre frequency of each sub-block and F2 represents
the interfering signal centre frequency. The widths of intermodulation
products are

● (n\*BW~F1~ + m\*5MHz) for the nF1±mF2 products

● (n\*5MHz + m\* BW~F1~) for the nF2±mF1 products

where BW~F1~ represents the wanted signal RF bandwidth, or channel
bandwidth in case of single carrier, or sub-block bandwidth.

### 6.6.5 Test Requirements

In the frequency range relevant for this test, the transmit
intermodulation level shall not exceed the out of band emission or the
spurious emission requirements of clauses 6.5.2 and 6.5.3 in the
presence of a WCDMA interfering signal with a power level 30 dB below
the rated total output power in the operating band.

For a BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum, the requirement is also
applicable inside a sub-block gap for interfering signal offsets where
the interfering signal falls completely within the sub-block gap. The
interfering signal offset is defined relative to the sub-block edges.

For a BS capable of multi-band operation, the requirement is also
applicable inside an Inter RF Bandwidth gap for interfering signal
offsets where the interfering signal falls completely within the Inter
RF Bandwidth gap. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to
the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges.

The measurements for out of band emission or spurious emission
requirement due to intermodulation can be limited to the frequency
ranges of all third and fifth order intermodulation products,
considering the width of these products and excluding the bandwidths of
the wanted and interfering signals.

NOTE: If the above Test Requirement differs from the Minimum Requirement
then the Test Tolerance applied for this test is non-zero. The Test
Tolerance for this test is defined in clause 4.2 and the explanation of
how the Minimum Requirement has been relaxed by the Test Tolerance is
given in Annex F.

### 6.7.1 Error Vector Magnitude

#### 6.7.1.1 Definition and applicability

The Error Vector Magnitude is a measure of the difference between the
reference waveform and the measured waveform. This difference is called
the error vector. Both waveforms pass through a matched Root Raised
Cosine filter with bandwidth 3.84 MHz and roll-off α =0.22. Both
waveforms are then further modified by selecting the frequency, absolute
phase, absolute amplitude and chip clock timing so as to minimise the
error vector. The EVM result is defined as the square root of the ratio
of the mean error vector power to the mean reference power expressed as
a %. The measurement interval is one timeslot as defined by the C-PICH
(when present) otherwise the measurement interval is one timeslot
starting with the beginning of the SCH. [ ]{.underline} The requirement
is valid over the total power dynamic range as specified in 25.104 \[1\]
clause 6.4.3. See Annex E of this specification for further details

#### 6.7.1.2 Minimum Requirement

The minimum requirement is in TS 25.104 \[1\] clause 6.8.2.

#### 6.7.1.3 Test Purpose

To verify that the Error Vector Magnitude is within the limit specified
by the minimum requirement.

#### 6.7.1.4 Method of Test

This test method includes the procedure for clause 6.3.4 Frequency
error.

##### 6.7.1.4.1 Initial Conditions

Test environment: normal; see clause 4.4.1.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: B, M and T; see clause 4.8

7 Receiver characteristics
==========================

7.1 General
-----------

The requirements in clause 7 are expressed for a single receiver antenna
connector. For receivers with antenna diversity, the requirements apply
for each receiver antenna connector.

Unless otherwise stated, all tests in this clause shall be performed at
the BS antenna connector (test port A) with a full complement of
transceivers for the configuration in normal operating conditions. If
any external apparatus such as a RX amplifier, a filter or the
combination of such devices is used, the tests according to clauses
4.6.2 and/or 4.6.4, depending on the device added, shall be performed to
ensure that the requirements are met at test port B.

Figure 7.1: Receiver test ports

For ACS, blocking and intermodulation characteristics, the negative
offsets of the interfering signal apply relative to the assigned channel
frequency of the lowest carrier frequency used and positive offsets of
the interfering signal apply relative to the assigned channel frequency
of the highest carrier frequency used.

The BER requirements defined for the receiver characteristics in this
clause do not assume HARQ transmissions.

When the BS is configured to receive multiple carriers, all the BER
requirements are applicable for each received carrier.

A BS supporting DC-HSUPA receives two cells simultaneously on adjacent
carrier frequencies.

A BS supporting DB-DC-HSUPA receives two cells simultaneously in
different operating bands.

In all the relevant clauses in this clause all Bit Error Ratio (BER),
Residual BER (RBER) and Block Error Ratio (BLER) measurements shall be
carried out according to the general rules for statistical testing
defined in ITU-T Recommendation O.153 \[5\] and Annex C.

If external BER measurement is not used then the internal BER
calculation shall be used instead. When internal BER calculation is
used, the requirements of the verification test according to 7.8 shall
be met in advance.

In tests performed with signal generators a synchronization signal may
be provided, from the base station to the signal generator, to enable
correct timing of the wanted signal.

7.2 Reference sensitivity level

interfering signal power applied to the BS antenna connector . For
duplex operation , the measurement configuration principle is indicated
for one duplex branch in Figure B.7. For internal BER calculation an
example of the test connection is as shown in figure B.7. The reference
point for signal power is at the input of the receiver (antenna
connector).

is defined relative to the lower/upper sub-block edge inside the
sub-block gap and is equal to -2.5MHz/+2.5MHz, respectively.

For a BS capable of multi-band operation, the requirement applies in
addition inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap, in case the Inter RF
Bandwidth gap size is at least 5MHz. The interfering signal offset is
defined relative to lower/upper Base Station RF Bandwidth edges inside
the Inter RF Bandwidth gap and is equal to -2.5MHz/+2.5MHz,
respectively.

7.5 Blocking characteristics
----------------------------

### 7.5.1 Definition and applicability

The blocking characteristics are measure of the receiver ability to
receive a wanted signal at its assigned channel frequency in the
presence of an unwanted interferer on frequencies other than those of
the adjacent channels. The interferences are either a WDCMA signal for
in-band blocking or a CW signal for out-of-band blocking.

The requirements shall apply to the indicated base station class,
depending on which frequency band is used. The test requirements in
Tables 7.4N to 7.4Q may be applied for the protection of FDD BS
receivers when GSM, DCS, PCS, CDMA, E-UTRA and/or UTRA BS operating in
Bands I to XXI are co-located with a UTRA FDD BS.

The additional test requirements in Tables 7.4U and 7.4V may be applied
for the protection of FDD BS receivers when a UTRA TDD BS is co-located
with a UTRA FDD BS.

### 7.5.2 Minimum Requirements

The minimum requirement is in TS 25.104 \[1\] clause 7.5.

### 7.5.3 Test purpose

The test stresses the ability of the BS receiver to withstand high-level
interference from unwanted signals at frequency offsets of 10 MHz or
more, without undue degradation of its sensitivity.

### 7.5.4 Method of test

#### 7.5.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clause 4.4.1.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M see clause 4.8. The BS
shall be configured to operate as close to the centre of the operating
band as possible.

Base Station RF Bandwidth positions to be tested for multi-carrier:
M~RFBW~; B~RFBW~\_T'~RFBW~ and B'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ in multi-band
operation; see subclause 4.8.1;

In addition, in multi-band operation:

\- For B~RFBW~\_T'~RFBW~, out-of-band blocking testing above the highest
operating band may be omitted

\- For B'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~, out-of-band blocking testing below the lowest
operating band may be omitted

1\) Connect WCDMA signal generator at the assigned channel frequency of
the wanted signal and a signal generator to the antenna connector of one
Rx port.

2\) Transmit a signal from the WCDMA signal generator to the BS. The
characteristics of the signal shall be set according to the UL reference
measurement channel (12,2 kbit/s) specified in annex A clause A.2.1. The
level of the WCDMA signal measured at the BS antenna connector shall be
set to the level specified in clause 7.5.5. For a BS supporting
multi-carrier operation, generate the wanted signal according to the
applicable test configuration (see clause 4.12) using applicable
reference measurement channel to the BS under test. Power settings are
specified in clause 7.5.5.

3\) For BS capable of single carrier operation only, start BS
transmission according to TM1, clause 6.1.1.1, at manufacturer's
declared rated output power, Prated,c.

For a BS declared to be capable of multi-carrier operation, set the BS
to transmit according to TM1 on all carriers configured, using the
applicable test configuration and corresponding power setting for
receiver tests, as specified in sub-clause 4.12.

In addition, for a multi-band capable BS with separate antenna
connectors, the following steps shall apply:

4\) For single band tests, repeat the steps above per involved band
where single band test configurations and test models shall apply with
no carrier activated in the other band.

The interfering signal shall first be applied on the same port as the
wanted signal. The test shall be repeated with the interfering signal
applied on the other port (if any) mapped to the same receiver as the
wanted signal. Any antenna connector with no signal applied in case of
single-band or multi-band test shall be terminated.

5\) Repeat step 4) with the wanted signal for the other band(s) applied
on the respective port(s).

The transmitter may be turned off for the out-of-band blocker tests when
the frequency of the blocker is such that no IM2 or IM3 products fall
inside the bandwidth of the wanted signal.

#### 7.5.4.2 Procedure

1\) Adjust the signal generators to the type of interfering signals and
the frequency offsets as specified in Tables 7.4K to 7.4T . Note that
the GMSK modulated interfering signal shall have an ACLR of at least
72 dB in order to eliminate the impact of interference signal adjacent
channel leakage power on the blocking characteristics measurement. For
the tests defined in Tables 7.4K to 7.4M, the interfering signal shall
be at a frequency offset Fuw from the assigned channel frequency of the
wanted signal which is given by:

Fuw = ± (n x 1 MHz),

where n shall be increased in integer steps from n = 10 up to such a
value that the center frequency of the interfering signal covers the
range from 1 MHz to 12,75 GHz.

2\) Measure the BER of the wanted signal at the BS receiver. For a BS
supporting multi-carrier operation the BER shall be measured for all
relevant carriers specified by the test configuration.

### 7.5.5 Test Requirements

For each measured carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0.001 for the
parameters specified in table 7.4K to 7.4V if applicable for the BS
under test.

The requirement is applicable outside the Base Station RF Bandwidth or
Maximum Radio Bandwidth. The interfering signal offset is defined
relative to the lower/upper Base Station RF Bandwith edges or Maximum
Radio Bandwidth edges.

For a BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum within any operating band,
the blocking requirement applies in addition inside any sub-block gap,
in case the sub-block gap size is at least 15MHz. The interfering signal
offset is defined relative to the lower/upper sub-block edge inside the
sub-block gap and is equal to -7.5MHz/+7.5MHz, respectively.

For a BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum within any operating band,
the narrowband blocking requirements in Tables 7.4R-7.4T apply in
addition inside any sub-block gap, in case the sub-block gap size is at
least 400kHz or 600kHz, depending on the operating band. The interfering
signal offset is defined relative to the lower/upper sub-block edge
inside the sub-block gap and is equal to -200kHz/+200kHz or
-300kHz/+300kHz, respectively.

For a BS capable of multi-band operation, the requirement in the in-band
blocking frequency range applies for each supported operating band. The
requirement applies in addition inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap, in
case the Inter RF Bandwidth gap size is at least 15MHz. The interfering
signal offset is defined relative to lower/upper Base Station RF
bandwidth edges inside the Inter RF Bandwidth gap and is equal to
-7.5MHz/+7.5MHz, respectively.

For a BS capable of multi-band operation, the requirement in the
out-of-band blocking frequency ranges apply for each operating band,
with the exception that the in-band blocking frequency ranges of all
supported operating bands according to Tables 7.4K - 7.4M shall be
excluded from the out-of-band blocking requirement.

For a BS capable of multi-band operation, the narrowband blocking
requirement applies in addition inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap, in
case the Inter RF Bandwidth gap size is at least 400kHz or 600kHz,
depending on the operating band. The interfering signal offset is
defined relative to lower/upper Base Station RF Bandwidth edges inside
the Inter RF Bandwidth gap and is equal to -200kHz/+200kHz or
-300kHz/+300kHz, respectively.

NOTE: Table 7.4M assumes that two operating bands, where the downlink
frequencies (see Table 3.0) of one band would be within the in-band
blocking region of the other band, are not deployed in the same
geographical area.

NOTE 1: If the above Test Requirement differs from the Minimum
Requirement then the Test Tolerance applied for this test is non-zero.
The Test Tolerance for this test is defined in clause 4.2 and the
explanation of how the Minimum Requirement has been relaxed by the Test
Tolerance is given in Annex F.

NOTE 2: Annex C describes the procedure for BER tests taking into
account the statistical consequence of frequent repetition of BER
measurements within the blocking test . The consequence is: a DUT
exactly on the limit may fail due to the statistical nature 2.55
times(mean value) in 12750 BER measurements using the predefined wrong
decision probability of 0.02%. If the fail cases are ≤12, it is allowed
to repeat the fail cases 1 time before the final verdict.

7.6 Intermodulation characteristics
-----------------------------------

### 7.6.1 Definition and applicability

Third and higher order mixing of the two interfering RF signals can
produce an interfering signal in the band of the desired channel.
Intermodulation response rejection is a measure of the capability of the
receiver to receive a wanted signal on its assigned channel frequency in
the presence of two or more interfering signals which have a specific
frequency relationship to the wanted signal.

### 7.6.2 Minimum Requirement

The minimum requirement is in TS 25.104 \[1\] clause 7.6.

7.5(a): (void)

Table 7.5(b): (void)

### 7.6.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify the ability of the BS receiver to inhibit
the generation of intermodulation products in its non-linear elements
caused by the presence of two high-level interfering signals at
frequencies with a specific relationship to the frequency of the wanted
signal.

### 7.6.4 Method of test

#### 7.6.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clause 4.4.1.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: B, M and T; see clause 4.8

Base Station RF Bandwidth positions to be tested for multi-carrier:
B~RFBW~, M~RFBW~ and T~RFBW~; B~RFBW~\_T'~RFBW~ and B'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ in
multi-band operation; see subclause 4.8.1;

1\) Set-up the equipment as shown in annex B.

#### 7.6.4.2 Procedures

1\) Generate the wanted signal (reference signal) and adjust ATT1 to set
the signal level to the BS under test to the level specified in table
7.5A. For a BS supporting multi-carrier operation, generate the wanted
signal according to the applicable test configuration (see clause 4.12)
using applicable reference measurement channel to the BS under test.
Power settings are specified in Table 7.5A.

2\) Adjust the signal generators to the type of interfering signals and
the frequency offsets as specified in Tables 7.5A(a) and 7.5A(b). Note
that the GMSK modulated interfering signal shall have an ACLR of at
least 72 dB in order to eliminate the impact of interference signal
adjacent channel leakage power on the intermodulation characteristics
measurement.

3\) Adjust the ATT2 and ATT3 to obtain the specified level of
interference signal at the BS input.

4\) Measure the BER of the wanted signal. For a BS supporting
multi-carrier operation the BER shall be measured for all relevant
carriers specified by the test configuration.

In addition, for a multi-band capable BS with separate antenna
connectors, the following steps shall apply:

5\) For single band tests, repeat the steps above per involved band
where single band test configurations shall apply with no carrier
activated in the other band.

The interfering signal shall first be applied on the same port as the
wanted signal. The test shall be repeated with the interfering signal
applied on the other port (if any) mapped to the same receiver as the
wanted signal. Any antenna connector with no signal applied in case of
single-band or multi-band test shall be terminated.

6\) Repeat step 5) with the wanted signal for the other band(s) applied
on the respective port(s).

### 7.6.5 Test requirements

For each measured carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0,001 for the
parameters specified in tables 7.5A(a) and 7.5(b).

The intermodulation performance shall be met when the following signals
are applied to the receiver.

For a BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum within any operating band,
the narrowband intermodulation requirement applies in addition inside
any sub-block gap, in case the sub-block gap size is at least 6.8MHz.
The CW interfering signal offset is defined relative to the lower/upper
sub-block edge inside the sub-block gap and is equal to -1MHz/+1MHz,
respectively. The GMSK modulated interfering signal offset is defined
relative to the lower/upper sub-block edge inside the sub-block gap and
is equal to -3.4MHz/+3.4MHz, respectively. The requirement applies
separately for both sub-blocks.

For a BS capable of multi-band operation, the narrowband intermodulation
requirement applies in addition inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap, in
case the Inter RF Bandwidth gap size is at least 6.8MHz. The CW
interfering signal offset is defined relative to lower/upper Base
Station RF Bandwidth edges inside the Inter RF Bandwidth gap and is
equal to -1MHz/+1MHz, respectively. The GMSK modulated interfering
signal offset is defined relative to lower/upper Base Station RF
Bandwidth edges inside the Inter RF Bandwidth gap and is equal to
-3.4MHz/+3.4MHz, respectively.

8.1 General
-----------

All Bit Error Ratio (BER) and Block Error ratio (BLER) measurements
shall be carried out according to the general rules for statistical
testing defined in ITU-T Recommendation O.153 \[5\] and Annex C.

If external BLER measurement is not used then the internal BLER

used, the requirements of the verification test according to 8.6 shall
be met in advance.

Performance requirements are specified for a number of test environments
and multi-path channel classes.

The requirements only apply to those measurement channels that are
supported by the base station. The performance requirements for the high
speed train conditions which scenarios defined in Annex D.4A are
optional. For FRC8 in Annex 9 and Annex 17 the Non E-DPCCH boosting and
E-DPCCH boosting requirement only apply for the option supported by the
base station.

Unless stated otherwise, performance requirements apply for a single
cell only. Performance requirements for a BS supporting DC-HSUPA or
DB-DC-HSUPA are defined in terms of single carrier requirements.

For BS with dual receiver antenna diversity, only the BS performance
requirements with Rx diversity are to be tested, the required E~b~/N~0~
shall be applied separately at each antenna port.

For BS without receiver antenna diversity, only the BS performance
requirements without Rx diversity are to be tested, the required
E~b~/N~0~ shall be applied at the BS Rx antenna port.

In tests performed with signal generators a synchronization signal may
be provided, from the base station to the signal generator, to enable
correct timing of the wanted signal.

For tests in clause 8 the transmitter may be off.

### 8.8.5 Demodulation of RACH message in high speed train conditions

#### 8.8.5.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of RACH in high speed train conditions is
determined by the maximum Block Error Ratio (BLER) allowed when the
receiver input signal is at a specified E~b~/N~0~ limit. The BLER is
calculated for each of the measurement channels supported by the base
station.

The requirement shall not be applied to Home BS.

The same preamble threshold factor as required to pass the tests in
clauses 8.8.1, 8.8.2, and 8.8.2A shall be used [for the same BS Rx
diversity configuration]{.underline}. Only one signature is used and it
is known by the receiver.

#### 8.8.5.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement is in TS 25.104 \[1\] clause 8.7.2.

#### 8.8.5.3 Test purpose

The test shall verify the receiver's ability to receive the test signal
under multipath fading case 3 propagation conditions with a BLER not
exceeding a specified limit.

#### 8.8.5.4 Method of test

##### 8.8.5.4.1 Initial conditions

> Test environment: normal; see clause 4.4.1.
>
> RF channels to be tested: B, M and T; see clause 4.8
>
> Preamble threshold factor: same as required to pass the tests in
> clauses 8.8.1, 8.8.2, and 8.8.2A [for the same BS Rx diversity
> configuration]{.underline}.

1\) For BS with Rx diversity, connect the BS tester generating the
wanted signal, multipath fading simulators and AWGN generators to both
BS antenna connectors for diversity reception via a combining network as
shown in annex B.

2\) For BS without Rx diversity, connect the BS tester generating the
wanted signal, multipath fading simulator and AWGN generator to the BS
antenna connector via a combining network as shown in annex B.

##### 8.8.5.4.2 Procedure

1\) Adjust the AWGN generator depending on the BS class under test at
the BS input as follows:.

> Wide Area: -84 dBm/3.84 MHz
>
> Medium Range: -74 dBm/3.84 MHz
>
> Local Area: -70 dBm/3.84 MHz

2\) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured
according to the corresponding UL reference measurement channel defined
in annex A.

3\) The multipath fading emulators shall be configured according to the
corresponding channel model defined in annex D.

4\) Adjust the equipment so that required E~b~/N~0~ specified in table
8.23A is achieved. To achieve the specified E~b~/N~O~, the ratio of the
wanted signal level (of the message part) relative to the AWGN signal at
the BS input should be adjusted to:

10\*Log10(TB/(TTI\*3.84\*10^6^))+E~b~/N~0~ \[ dB\]

5\) The test signal generator sends a preamble followed by the actual
RACH message. This pattern is repeated (see figure 8.5A). The receiver
tries to detect the preamble and the message. The block error rate is
calculated for the messages that have been decoded. Messages following
undetected preambles shall not be taken into account in the BLER
measurement.

### 8.11A.2 ACK false alarm for 4C-HSDPA in multipath fading conditions

#### 8.11A.2.1 Definition and applicability

ACK false alarm for 4C-HSDPA HS-DPCCH is defined as in Section 8.11A
when input is only DPCCH and DPDCH (+interference). The performance
requirement of ACK false alarm in multipath fading conditions is
determined by the maximum error ratio allowed when the receiver input
signal is at a specified E~c~/N~0~ limit. ACK false alarm: P(DTX-\>ACK)
shall be 10^-2^ or less.

#### 8.11A.2.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement is in TS 25.104 \[1\] clause 8.10A.1.1.

#### 8.11A.2.3 Test purpose

The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to detect 4C-HSDPA
HS-DPCCH signalling (ACK/NACK) under multipath fading case 1 propagation
conditions.

#### 8.11A.2.4 Method of test

##### 8.11A.2.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see clause 4.4.1.

RF channels to be tested: B, M and T; see clause 4.8

1\) Connect the BS tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading
simulators and AWGN generators to both BS antenna connectors for
diversity reception via a combining network as shown in Annex B.3.2.

##### 8.11A.2.4.2 Procedure

1\) Adjust the AWGN generator depending on the BS class under test at
the BS input as follows:

> Wide Area: -84 dBm/3.84 MHz
>
> Medium Range: -74 dBm/3.84 MHz
>
> Local Area / Home BS: -70 dBm/3.84 MHz

2\) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured
according to the corresponding UL reference measurement channel defined
in Annex A.9A.

3\) The multipath fading emulators shall be configured according to the
corresponding channel model defined in Annex D.

4\) Adjust the equipment so that required E~c~/N~0~ specified in Table
8.11A.2 is achieved. To achieve the specified E~c~/N~0~, the ratio of
the wanted signal level relative to the AWGN signal at the BS input
should be adjusted to: E~c~/N~0~ \[ dB\].

5\) The test signal generator sends only DPCCH and DPDCH. The receiver
tries to detect HS-DPCCH signalling. The ACK false detection rate should
be measured only on those slots corresponding to the ACK/NACK field of
HS-DPCCH..

#### 8.11A.2.5 Test requirements

The probability of ACK false alarm for each stream shall not exceed the
required error ratio for the E~c~/N~0~ specified in Table 8.11A.2

### 8.11A.3 ACK mis-detection for 4C-HSDPA in static propagation conditions

#### 8.11A.3.1 Definition and applicability

The probability of ACK mis-detection for each stream, P(ACK-\>NACK, DTX
(no transmission) or DTX codeword) (=an ACK for a given stream in a
transmitted HARQ message is mis-detected as a NACK or DTX (no
transmission) or DTX codeword in the received HARQ message) shall not
exceed the required error ratio for the E~c~/N~0~ specified in Table
8.11A.3. This requirement shall be conditioned on that the ACK false
alarm requirement in Table 8.11A.1. above shall also be concurrently
satisfied.

The performance requirement of ACK mis-detection in static propagation
conditions is determined by the maximum error ratio allowed when the
receiver input signal is at a specified E~c~/N~0~ limit.

#### 8.11A.3.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement is in TS 25.104 \[1\] clause 8.10A.1.2.

NOTE: If the above Test Requirement differs from the Minimum Requirement
then the Test Tolerance applied for this test is non-zero. The Test
Tolerance for this test is defined in clause 4.2 and the explanation of
how the Minimum Requirement has been relaxed by the Test Tolerance is
given in Annex F.

8.11B Performance of signalling detection for 8C-HSDPA HS-DPCCH
---------------------------------------------------------------

This test shall be performed only for the BS supporting 8C-HSDPA.

In 8C-HSDPA two identical HS-DPCCH channels similar to the 4C-HSDPA
HS-DPCCH are used and they are transmitted by means of I/Q multiplexing.
One HS-DPCCH is dedicated to carriers 1 to 4, while the other to
carriers 5 to 8. The same test requirements as for 4C-HSDPA HS-DPCCH, as
defined in section 8.11A, shall be fulfilled for both I and Q HS-DPCCH
channels.

The appropriate codebook subset is chosen for testing.

8.12 Demodulation of E-DPDCH in multipath fading conditions
-----------------------------------------------------------

### 8.12.1 Definition and applicability

The performance requirement of the E-DPDCH in multi path fading
condition is determined by the minimum throughput, R. Test parameters
are specified in Table 8.38.

For a BS supporting DC-HSUPA or DB-DC-HSUPA the requirements for FRC1,
FRC2, FRC3 and FRC8 shall apply on each cell.

########  Annex C (normative): General rules for statistical testing

C.1 Statistical testing of receiver BER/BLER performance
========================================================

C.1.1 Error Definition
----------------------

Bit Error Ration (BER) and Block Error Ratio (BLER) are defined in
section 3.1.

C.1.2 Test Method
-----------------

Each test is performed in the following manner:

a\) Setup the required test conditions.

b\) Record the number of samples tested and the number of occurred
events (bit error or block error)

c\) Stop the test at a stop criterion which is minimum test time or an
early pass or an early fail event.

d\) Once the test is stopped decide according to the pass fail decision
rules ( clause C.1.7)

C.1.3 Test Criteria
-------------------

The test shall fulfil the following requirements:

a\) good pass fail decision

1\) to keep reasonably low the probability (risk) of passing a bad unit
for each individual test;

2\) to have high probability of passing a good unit for each individual
test;

b\) good balance between test time and statistical significance

3\) to perform measurements with a high degree of statistical
significance;

4\) to keep the test time as low as possible.

C.1.4 Calculation assumptions
-----------------------------

### C.1.4.1 Statistical independence

a\) It is assumed, that error events are rare (lim BER BLER 0)
independent statistical events. However the memory of the convolutional
/turbo coder is terminated after one TTI. Samples and errors are summed
up every TTI. So the assumption of independent error events is
justified.

b\) In the BLER test with fading there is the memory of the multipath
fading channel which interferes the statistical independence. A minimum
test time is introduced to average fluctuations of the multipath fading
channel. So the assumption of independent error events is justified
approximately.

### C.1.4.2 Applied formulas

The formulas, applied to describe the BER BLER test, are based on the
following experiments:

1\) After having observed a certain number of errors (**ne**) the number
of samples are counted to calculate BER BLER. Provisions are made (note
1) such that the complementary experiment is valid as well:

2\) After a certain number of samples (**ns**) the number of errors,
occurred, are counted to calculate BER BLER.

Experiment 1) stipulates to use the following Chi Square Distribution
with degree of freedom ne:

2\*dchisq(2\*NE,2\*ne).

Experiment 2) stipulates to use the Poisson Distribution:

dpois(ne,NE)

(NE: mean of the distribution)

To determine the early stop conditions, the following inverse cumulative
operation is applied:

0.5 \* qchisq(D,2\*ne). This is applicable for experiment (1) and (2).

D: wrong decision risk per test step

NOTE: Other inverse cumulative operations are available, however only
this is suited for experiment (1) and (2).

### C.1.4.3 Approximation of the distribution

The test procedure is as follows:

During a running measurement for a UE ns (number of samples) and ne
(number of errors) are accumulated and from this the preliminary BER
BLER is calculated. Then new samples up to the next error are taken. The
entire past and the new samples are basis for the next preliminary BER
BLER. Depending on the result at every step, the UE can pass, can fail
or must continue the test.

As early pass- and early fail-UEs leave the statistical totality under
consideration, the experimental conditions are changed every step
resulting in a distribution that is truncated more and more towards the
end of the entire test. Such a distribution can not any more be handled
analytically. The unchanged distribution is used as an approximation to
calculate the early fail and early pass bounds.

C.1.5 Definition of good pass fail decision.
--------------------------------------------

This is defined by the probability of wrong decision F at the end of the
test. The probability of a correct decision is 1-F.

The probability (risk) to fail a good DUT shall be ≤ F according to the
following definition: The failed DUT is still better than the specified
error ratio (Test requirement)with a probability of ≤ F.

The probability to pass a bad DUT shall be ≤ F according to the
following definition: The passed DUT is still worse than M times the
specified error ratio (M\>1 is the bad DUT factor) with a probability of
≤ F.

This definitions lead to an early pass and an early fail limit:

Early fail: ber≥ berlim~fail~

\(1\)

For ne≥7

Early pass: ber ≤berlimbad~pass~

\(2\)

For ne ≥ 1

C.1.6 Good balance between test time and statistical significance
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Three independent test parameters are introduced into the test and shown
in Table C.1. These are the obvious basis of test time and statistical
significance. From the first two of them four dependent test parameters
are derived. The third independent test parameter is justified
separately.

The minimum test time is derived from the following justification:

1\) For no propagation conditions and static propagation condition

No early fail calculated from fractional number of errors \<1 (see note
1)

2\) For multipath fading condition

No stop of the test until 990 wavelengths are crossed with the speed
given in the fading profile.

3\) For birth death propagation conditions

No stop of the test until 200 birth death transitions occur

4\) For moving propagation conditions: 628 sec

This is necessary in order to pass all potential critical points in the
moving propagation profile 4 times: Maximum rake window, Maximum
adjustment speed, Intersection of moving taps

5\) For high speed train conditions

Scenario 1: 82.3s. This corresponds to 4 complete cycles of approach
towards and departure leave to and from a BS antenna

Scenario 2: The test shall continue until 990 wavelengths are crossed
with the speed given in the fading profile (1.8s corresponding 300 km/h)

Scenario 3: 28.8s. This corresponds to 4 complete cycles of approach
towards and departure from a BS antenna

Table C.2: minimum Test time

  ---------------------------------------- -------------------
  Fading profile                           Minimum test time
  Multipath propagation Case 1, Case 2     164 sec
  Multipath propagation Case 3             4.1 sec
  Multipath propagation Case 4             2 sec
  Birth Death propagation                  38.2 sec
  Moving propagation                       628 sec
  High speed train conditions Scenario 1   82.3 sec
  High speed train conditions Scenario 2   1.8 sec
  High speed train conditions Scenario 3   28.8 sec
  ---------------------------------------- -------------------

In table C.3 to C.9 the minimum test time is converted in minimum number
of samples.

C.1.7 Pass fail decision rules
------------------------------

No decision is allowed before the minimum test time is elapsed.

1\) If minimum Test time \< time for target number of error events then
the following applies: The required confidence level 1-F (= correct
decision probability) shall be achieved. This is fulfilled at an early
pass or early fail event.

**For BER:**

For every TTI (Transmit Time Interval) sum up the number of bits (ns)
and the number if errors (ne) from the beginning of the test and
calculate

BER~1~ (including the artificial error at the beginning of the test
(Note 1))and

BER~0~ (excluding the artificial error at the beginning of the test
(Note 1)).

If BER~0~ is above the early fail limit, fail the DUT.

If BER~1~ is below the early pass limit, pass the DUT.

Otherwise continue the test

**For BLER:**

For every TTI sum up the number of blocks (ns) and the number of
erroneous blocks (ne) from the beginning of the test and calculate

BLER~1~ (including the artificial error at the beginning of the test
(Note 1))and

BLER~0~ (excluding the artificial error at the beginning of the test
(Note 1)).

If BLER~1~ is below the early pass limit, pass the DUT.

If BLER~0~ is above the early fail limit, fail the DUT.

Otherwise continue the test

2\) If the minimum test time ≥ time for target error events, then the
test runs for the minimum test time and the decision is done by
comparing the result with the test limit.

**For BER:**

For every TTI (Transmit Time Interval) sum up the number of bits (ns)
and the number if errors (ne) from the beginning of the test and
calculate BER~0~

**For BLER:**

For every TTI sum up the number of blocks (ns) and the number of
erroneous blocks (ne) from the beginning of the test and calculate
BLER~0~

If BER~0~/BLER~0~ is above the test limit, fail the DUT.

If BER~0~/BLER~0~ is on or below the test limit, pass the DUT.

C.1.9 Practical Use (informative)
---------------------------------

See figure C.1.9:

The early fail limit represents formula (1) in C.1.5. The range of
validity is ne≥ 7 ( ≥8 in case of blocking test) to ne =345

The early pass limit represents formula (2) in C.1.5. The range of
validity is ne=1 to ne =345. See note 1

The intersection co-ordinates of both curves are : target number of
errors ne = 345 and test limit TL = 1.234.

The range of validity for TL is ne\>345.

A typical BER BLER test, calculated form the number of samples and
errors (C.1.2.(b)) using experimental method (1) or (2) (see C.1.4.2
calculation assumptions) runs along the yellow trajectory. With an
errorless sample the trajectory goes down vertically. With an erroneous
sample it jumps up right. The tester checks if the BER BLER test
intersects the early fail or early pass limits. The real time processing
can be reduced by the following actions:

BLER~0~ (excluding the artificial error at the beginning of the test
(Note 1)). is calculated only in case of an error event.

BER~0~ (excluding the artificial error at the beginning of the test
(Note 1)). is calculated only in case of an error event within a TTI.

So the early fail limit cannot be missed by errorless samples.

The check against the early pass limit may be done by transforming
formula (2) in C.1.5 such that the tester checks against a
[L]{.underline}imit-[N]{.underline}umber-of-samples ( NL(ne)) depending
on the current number of errors (including the artificial error at the
beginning of the test (Note 1)).

Early pass if

TR: test requirement (0.001)

Figure C.1.9

NOTE 1: At the beginning of the test, an artificial error is introduced.
This ensures that an ideal DUT meets the valid range of the early pass
limit. In addition this ensures that the complementary experiment
(C.1.4.2 bullet point (2)) is applicable as well.\
For the check against the early fail limit the artificial erroneous
sample, introduced at the beginning of the test , is disregarded.\
Due to the nature of the test, namely discrete error events, the early
fail condition shall not be valid, when fractional errors \<1 are used
to calculate the early fail limit: Any early fail decision is postponed
until number of errors ne ≥7. In the blocking test any early fail
decision is postponed until number of errors ne ≥ 8.

NOTE 2: F=0.2% is intended to be used for a test containing a few
BER/BLER tests (e.g. receiver sensitivity is repeated 12 times(3 RF
Channels \* 2 Power-supplies \* 2 Temperatures). For a test containing
many BER/BLER tests (e.g. blocking test) this value is not appropriate
for a single BER/BLER test.\
The blocking test contains approx. 12750 single BER tests. A DUT on the
limit will fail approx. 25 to 26 times due to statistical reasons using
wrong decision probability at the end of the test F= 0.2%. This shall be
solved by the following rule:

All passes (based on F=0.2%) are accepted, including the wrong decisions
due to statistical reasons.

An early fail limit based on F=0.02% instead of 0.2% is established.
That ensures that wrong decisions due to statistical reasons are reduced
to 2 to 3 in 12750 BER measurements. If the fail cases are ≤12, it is
allowed to repeat each fail cases 1 time before the final verdict.\
These asymmetric test conditions ensure that a DUT on the limit consumes
hardly more test time for a blocking test than in the symmetric case and
reduces the wrong decision probability considerably and on the other
hand the repetition allowance sufficiently suppresses the residual
statistically caused wrong verdict for the aggregate test.

C.2 Statistical Testing of E-DPDCH Throughput
=============================================

C.2.1 Definition
----------------

Information Bit Throughput R:

The measured information bit throughput R is defined as the sum (in
kilobits) of the information bit payloads (excluding the 24-bit CRC)
successfully received during the test interval, divided by the duration
of the test interval (in seconds).

C.2.2 Mapping throughput to block error ratio
---------------------------------------------

a\) In measurement practice the BS indicates successfully received
information bit payload by signalling an ACK to the tester.\
If payload is received, but damaged and cannot be decoded, the BS
signals a NACK.

b\) Only the ACK and NACK signals, not the data bits received, are
accessible to the tester.\
The number of bits is known in the tester from knowledge of what payload
was sent.

c\) For fixed reference channel the number of bits in a TTI is fixed
during one test.

d\) The time in the measurement interval is composed of successful TTIs
(ACK), unsuccessful TTIs (NACK) and DTX-TTIs.

e\) DTX-TTIs occur statistically when the BS is not responding ACK or
NACK where it should. (statDTX)\
This may happen when the BS misses data, that are intended for it.

The pass / fail decision is done by observing the:

\- number of NACKs

\- number of ACKs and

\- number of statDTXs

The ratio (NACK + statDTX)/(NACK+ statDTX +ACK)is the Bock Error Ratio
BLER. Taking into account the time consumed by the ACK-, NACK-, and
statDTX-TTIs, BLER can be mapped unambiguously to throughput for any
single FRC test.

C.2.3 Bad DUT factor
--------------------

NOTE: A statistical test of limited test duration and confidence level
\>1/2 exhibits limited selectivity. The Bad DUT factor ≠ 1 is a measure
of limited selectivity.

Data throughput in a communication system is of statistical nature and
must be measured and decided pass or fail. The specified limit of
throughput related to the ideal throughput in different throughput tests
is in the range of a few % to near 100%. To make it comparable with BER,
we define the complement of the relative throughput: BLER as defined
above. Complementary this is in the range of near 100% down to a few %
For e.g. BLER = 1%, the currently in BER BLER used Bad DUT factor M=1.5
is highly meaningful. For e.g. BLER = 99%, the currently used M=1.5 is
obviously meaningless.

An appropriate definition of the bad DUT factor is illustrated in figure
C.2.3: constant and variable Bad DUT factor.

It illustrates how to find the Bad BLER when the nominal BLER is given.

1\) In the range 0%\< nominal BLER\>10% the Bad DUT factor is constant
1.5

2\) In the range 90%\< bad BLER\>100% it decreases to 1. (symmetrical to
(1))

3\) The range in between is interpolated by an arc section.

The example shows: nominal BLER=35,6% bad BLER=47.67.5% M=1.34

Figure C.2.3: constant and variable Bad DUT factor

Formula:

For 0 \< BLER\<= 0.1 M = 1.5

For 0.1 \<BLER \<.85

For 0.85 \<= BLER \< 1 M(BLER)= 2/3BLER + 1/3

With BLER: nominal Block Error Ratio (0\<BLER\<1)

With r = 2.70415 (Radius of the arc)

### C.2.3.1 Bad DUT factor, range of applicability

Inaccuracy is one practical reason to avoid the grey shaded area of
figure C.2.3: constant and variable Bad DUT factor. For BLER near 1 the
Bad DUT factor M is near 1. For M=1,exactly, the pass and fail criteria
do not intersect. The test never is finalised.

For M near 1 the pass and fail criteria exhibit a very smooth
intersection. In addition the binomial distribution and its inverse are
of discrete nature. Therefore the test limit and the number of samples
is calculable only very ambiguous.

It is proposed to apply the bad DUT factor only in the not shaded area
of figure C.2.3.

This is done by the following:

BLER mode:

Use BLER as defined above in the range of 0 to 50%, use M \>1 as defined
above.

The Test Limit will be \> the Minimum Requirement in the table C.10
below.

Relative Throughput mode:

If BLER is in the range 50 to 100%, use 1-BLER instead. Use m\<1 instead
of M.

1-BLER is the relative throughput with respect to the ideal throughput.

As a consequence, the Test Limit \< the Minimum Requirement

Formula for m:

For 0 \< (1-BLER) \<= 0.15, m = 1/1.5

For 0.15 \<(1-BLER) \<.85,

In the figure C.2.3 this is represented by the red mapping.

The table C.10 below distinguishes between m and M.

C.2.4 Minimum Test time
-----------------------

Same as with BER BLER there is a minimum test time necessary for
multipath fading profiles with the same justification: Table C.2 in
Annex C.1applies for throughput tests as well.

The minimum Test Time is

1\) the minimum test time due to statistical reasons

( To ensure the confidence level, the test must be continued until a
certain number of samples (NACK+ statDTX +ACK) is reached.)

2\) the minimum test time due to multipath fading.

The longer test time applies.

C.2.5 Statistical independence
------------------------------

If a process works within an incremental redundancy sequence, the
samples and errors are not independent. The incremental redundancy
sequence for every process must be finalised, successfully or
unsuccessfully, on or beyond the minimum test time.

Then the BLER (or 1-BLER) is compared with the Test Limit to decide pass
or fail.

The distribution of errors in an HARQ process with dependent errors is
narrower, than the equivalent binomial distribution.

The distribution of errors, where the current BLER fluctuates due to the
multipath propagation channel, is narrower than the equivalent binomial
distribution.

Hence the application of the binomial distribution and its inverse
function yields a conservative decision in the sence that the true
confidence level is slightly higher than the given one.

(The binomial distribution describes a time-independent statistical
process, where the errors occur memoryless)

C.2.6 Formula
-------------

True BLER in the range of near 0% to near 100% does not allow to use any
approximated distributions. The binomial distribution and its inverse
cumulative function: qbinom is appropriate for this test.

a\) For the BLER test mode:

ne~low~=qbinom(D,ns,M\*BLER~limit~) (1)

ne~high~=qbinom(1-D,ns,BLER~limit~) (2)

given: 1-D: confidence level= 99.8%

BLER~limit~=Block error ratio at the limit

M: Bad DUT factor \>1

Input: ns: number of samples (NACK+ statDTX + ACK)

Output ne: number of events (NACK+ statDTX)

The intersection of (1) and (2) is the Test Limit with the coordinates:
ns and ne

b\) For the Relative Throughput test mode:

ne~low~=qbinom(D,ns,1-BLER~limit~) (3)

ne~high~=qbinom(1-D,ns,m\*(1-BLER~limit)~) (4)

given: 1-D: confidence level= 99.8%

1-BLER~limit~= Relative Throughtput at the limit

m: Bad DUT factor \<1

Input: ns: number of samples (NACK+ statDTX + ACK)

Output ne: number of events (ACK)

The intersection of (3) and (4) is the Test Limit with the coordinates:
ns and ne

NOTE: In contrast to BER BLER test, this approach does not contain any
test time optimisation.\
(early pass, early fail)

C.2.7 Meaning of a decision
---------------------------

After the minimum test time in terms of ns, ne is compared against the
test limit and an idividual throughput test is decided accordingly.

A pass means: The true throughput is not worse than a Bad Throughput
with 99.8% confidence level.

A fail means: The true throughput is not better than a Limit Throughput
with 99.8% confidence level.

NOTE: A single throughput test measured on a marginal receiver will be
correctly decided with 99.8% probability, but incorrectly with 0.2%
probability. A single throughput test is repeated in 112 variations. (7
FRCs \* 4 fading profiles \* 2 diversity modes \* 2 limits). A marginal
DUT, marginal on each variation, will experience one fail due to
statistical reasons with approx. 22% probability. This situation is
accepted but may be revised in future.

C.2.8 The test limit
--------------------

\- NACK+ statDTX + ACK is summarised as No of samples (ns)

\- NACK+ statDTX is summarised as No of errors

\- ACK is summarised as No of successes

\- In the BLER test mode the ratio: No of errors/ No of samples is
recorded. In this mode the test limit is above the minimum requirement
and a pass is below the test limit.

\- In the Relative Throughput test mode (1-BLER) the ratio: No of
successes/ No of samples is recorded. In this mode the test limit is
below the minimum requirement and a pass is above the test limit.

\- The test mode, used, is indicated by bold versus gray-shading

\- The generic term for No of errors (BLER mode) or No of successes
(Relative Throughput mode) is No of events (ne). This is used in the
table columns Test Limit and pass condition.

########  Annex D (normative): Propagation conditions

D.1 Static propagation condition
================================

The propagation for the static performance measurement is an Additive
White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) environment. No fading or multi-paths exist
for this propagation model.

D.2 Multi-path fading propagation conditions
============================================

Table D.1 shows propagation conditions that are used for the performance
measurements in multi-path fading environment. All taps have classical
Doppler spectrum, defined as:

(CLASS) ![](media/image73.wmf){width="1.7791666666666666in"
height="0.2513888888888889in"} for f ∈ -fd, fd.

D.3 Moving propagation conditions
=================================

The dynamic propagation conditions for the test of the baseband
performance are non fading channel models with two taps. The moving
propagation condition has two tap, one static, Path0, and one moving,
Path1. The time difference between the two paths is according Equation
(D.1). The taps have equal strengths and equal phases.

D.4 Birth-Death propagation conditions
======================================

The dynamic propagation conditions for the test of the baseband
performance is a non fading propagation channel with two taps. The
birth-death propagation condition has two taps, Path1 and Path2 which
alternate between \'birth\' and \'death\'. The positions the paths
appear are randomly selected with an equal probability rate and is shown
in figure D.2. For BS with receiver diversity, the same path positions
shall be applied to both receiver antenna connectors, and the path
switching times shall be synchronized on the two receiver antenna
connectors, but the AWGN signals applied to the two receiver antenna
connectors shall be uncorrelated.

Figure D.2: Birth death propagation sequence

1\. Two paths, Path1 and Path2 are randomly selected from the group
\[-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0 ,1, 2, 3, 4, 5\] μs. The paths have equal
magnitudes and equal phases.

2\. After 191 ms, Path1 vanishes and reappears immediately at a new
location randomly selected from the group \[-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0 ,1, 2,
3, 4, 5\] μs but excludes the point Path2. The magnitudes and the phases
of the tap coefficients of Path 1 and Path 2 shall remain unaltered.

3\. After an additional 191 ms, Path2 vanishes and reappears immediately
at a new location randomly selected from the group \[-5, -4, -3, -2, -1,
0 ,1, 2, 3, 4, 5\] μs but excludes the point Path1. The magnitudes and
the phases of the tap coefficients of Path 1 and Path 2 shall remain
unaltered.

4\. The sequence in 2) and 3) is repeated.

D.4A High speed train conditions
--------------------------------

High speed train conditions are as follows:

> Scenario 1: Open space
>
> Scenario 2: Tunnel with leaky cable
>
> Scenario 3: Tunnel for multi-antennas

The high speed train conditions for the test of the baseband performance
are 2 non fading propagation channels (scenario 1 and 3) and 1 fading
propagation channel (scenario 2) with one tap. For BS with Rx diversity
defined in scenario 1, the Doppler shift variation is the same between
antennas.

For scenario 1 and 3, Doppler shift is given by

(D.2)

where is the Doppler shift and is the maximum Doppler frequency. The
cosine of angle is given by

, (D.3)

, (D.4)

, (D.5)

where is the initial distance of the train from BS, and is BS-Railway
track distance, both in meters; is the velocity of the train in m/s, is
time in seconds.

For scenario 2, Rician fading is considered where Rician factor, *K* is
defined as the ratio between the dominant signal power and the variant
of the other weaker signals.

Doppler shift and cosine angle is given by equation D.2 and D.3-D.5
respectively, where the required input parameters listed in table D.2A
and the resulting Doppler shift shown in Figure D.3 and D.4 are applied
for all frequency bands.

DC-HSUPA and DB-DC-HSUPA requirements, the fading of the signals for
each cell shall be independent.

########  Annex E (normative): Global In-Channel TX-Test

E.1 General
===========

The global in-channel Tx test enables the measurement of all relevant
parameters that describe the in-channel quality of the output signal of
the Tx under test in a single measurement process. The parameters
describing the in-channel quality of a transmitter, however, are not
necessarily independent. The algorithm chosen for description inside
this annex places particular emphasis on the exclusion of all
interdependencies among the parameters. Any other algorithm (e.g. having
better computational efficiency) may be applied, as long as the results
are the same within the acceptable uncertainty of the test system as
defined in clause 4.1

E.2 Definition of the process
=============================

E.2.1 Basic principle
---------------------

The process is based on the comparison of the actual **output signal of
the TX under test**, received by an ideal receiver, with a **reference
signal**, that is generated by the measuring equipment and represents an
ideal error free received signal. The reference signal shall be composed
of the same number of codes at the correct spreading factors as
contained In the test signal. Note, for simplification, the notation
below assumes only codes of one spreading factor although the algorithm
is valid for signals containing multiple spreading factors. All signals
are represented as equivalent (generally complex) baseband signals.

E.2.2 Output signal of the TX under test
----------------------------------------

The output signal of the TX under test is acquired by the measuring
equipment, filtered by a matched filter (RRC 0.22, correct in shape and
in position on the frequency axis) and stored for further processing

The following form represents the physical signa l in the entire
measurement interval:

one vector **Z**, containing N = ns x sf complex samples;

with

ns: [n]{.underline}umber of [s]{.underline}ymbols in the measurement
interval;

sf: number of chips per symbol. (sf: [s]{.underline}preading
[f]{.underline}actor) (see Note: Symbol length)

E.2.3 Reference signal
----------------------

The reference signal is constructed by the measuring equipment according
to the relevant TX specifications.

It is filtered by the same matched filter, mentioned in E.2.2., and
stored at the Inter-Symbol-Interference free instants. The following
form represents the reference signal in the entire measurement interval:

one vector **R**, containing N = ns x sf complex samples

where

ns: number of symbols in the measurement interval;

sf: number of chips per symbol. (see Note: Symbol length)

E.2.4 Classification of measurement results
-------------------------------------------

The measurement results achieved by the global in-channel TX test can be
classified into two types:

\- Results of type \"deviation\", where the error-free parameter has a
non-zero magnitude. (These are the parameters that quantify the integral
physical characteristic of the signal).These parameters are:

RF Frequency

Power (in case of single code)

Code Domain Power (in case of multi code)

Timing (only for UE) (see Note: Deviation)

(Additional parameters: see Note: Deviation)

\- Results of type \"residual\", where the error-free parameter has
value zero. (These are the parameters that quantify the error values of
the measured signal, whose ideal magnitude is zero). These parameters
are:

Error Vector Magnitude (EVM);

Peak Code Domain Error (PCDE).

(Additional parameters: see Note: Residual)

E.2.5 Process definition to achieve results of type \"deviation\"
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The reference signal (**R**; see clause E.2.3) and the signal under Test
(Z; see clause E.2.2) are varied with respect to the parameters
mentioned in clause E.2.4 under \"results of type deviation\" in order
to achieve best fit. Best fit is achieved when the RMS difference value
between the varied signal under test and the varied reference signal is
an absolute minimum.

Overview:

Z : Signal under test.

R: Reference signal,

with frequency f, the timing t, the phase ϕ, gain of code1 (g~1~), gain
of code2 (g~2~) etc, and the gain of the synch channel g~synch~ See
Note: Power Step

The parameters marked with a tilde in Z and R are varied in order to
achieve a best fit.

For most measurement results the best fit process is to be carried out
over the whole measurement interval corresponding to the duration of one
slot, i.e. ns \* sf = 2560 chips in E.2.2 and E.2.3. Some measurements
are, however, defined for a measurement interval corresponding to the
duration of one frame, i.e. ns \* sf = 38400 chips. In this latter case,
the best fit with respect to **Z** and **R** is to be carried out
successively over multiple best fit intervals (segments) corresponding
to the duration of one slot each, i.e. 15 times for a measurement
interval corresponding to the duration of one frame.

Detailed formula: see Note: Formula for the minimum process

The varied reference signal, after the best fit process, will be called
**R'.**

The varied signal under test, after the best fit process, will be called
**Z'.**

**R'** and **Z'** are each of length ns \* sf and depending on the
length of the measurement interval result of possibly multiple
successive applications of the minimum process.

The varying parameters, leading to **R' and Z** represent directly the
wanted results of type \"deviation\". These measurement parameters are
expressed as deviation from the reference value with the same units as
the reference value.

In the case of multi code, the type-\"deviation\"-parameters (frequency,
timing and (RF-phase)) are varied commonly for all codes such that the
process returns one frequency-deviation, one timing deviation, (one
RF-phase -deviation).

(These parameters are [not]{.underline} varied on the individual code
signals such that the process would return kr frequency errors\... .
(kr: number of codes)).

The only type-\"deviation\"-parameters varied individually are the code
domain gain factors (g1, g2, ...)

See Note: Power Step.

### E.2.5.1 Decision Point Power

The mean-square value of the signal-under-test, sampled at the best
estimate of the of Intersymbol-Interference-free points using the
process defined in clause 2.5, is referred to the *Decision Point Power*
(DPP):

### E.2.5.2 Code-Domain Power

The samples, Z', are separated into symbol intervals to create ns
time-sequential vectors **z** with sf complex samples comprising one
symbol interval. The *Code Domain Power* is calculated according to the
following steps:

1\) Take the vectors **z** defined above.

2\) To achieve meaningful results it is necessary to descramble **z,**
leading to **z'** (see Note: Scrambling code)

3\) Take the orthogonal vectors of the channelization code set **C**
(all codes belonging to one spreading factor) as defined in TS 25.213
and TS 25.223 (range +1, -1), and normalize by the norm of the vectors
to produce **C**norm=**C**/sqrt(sf). (see Note: Symbol length)

4\) Calculate the inner product of **z'** with **C**norm**.**. Do this
for all symbols of the measurement interval and for all codes in the
code space.\
This gives an array of format k x ns, each value representing a specific
symbol and a specific code, which can be exploited in a variety of ways.

k: total number of codes in the code space

ns: number of symbols in the measurement interval

5\) Calculate k mean-square values, each mean-square value unifying ns
symbols within one code.\
(These values can be called \"*Absolute CodeDomainPower* (CDP)\"
\[Volt^2^\].) The sum of the k values of CDP is equal to DPP.

6\) Normalize by the decision point power to obtain

E.2.6 Process definition to achieve results of type \"residual\"
----------------------------------------------------------------

The difference between the varied reference signal (**R'**; see
clauseE.2.5.) and the varied TX signal under test (**Z'**; see
clauseE.2.5) is the error vector **E** versus time:

**E** = **Z'** - **R'**

Depending on the parameter to be evaluated, it is appropriate to
represent **E** in one of the following two different forms:

[Form EVM]{.underline} (representing the physical error signal in the
entire measurement interval)

One vector **E**, containing N = ns x sf complex samples;

with

ns: number of symbols in the measurement interval

sf: number of chips per symbol (see Note: Symbol length)

[Form PCDE]{.underline} (derived from Form EVM by separating the samples
into symbol intervals)

ns time-sequential vectors **e** with sf complex samples comprising one
symbol interval.

**E** and **e** give results of type \"residual\" applying the two
algorithms defined in clauses E.2.6.1 and E.2.6.2.

### E.2.6.1 Error Vector Magnitude (EVM)

The Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) is calculated according to the
following steps:

1\) Take the error vector **E** defined in clause E.2.6 (Form EVM) and
calculate the RMS value of **E**; the result will be called RMS(**E**).

2\) Take the varied reference vector **R'** defined in clause E.2.5 and
calculate the RMS value of **R'**; the result will be called
RMS(**R'**).

3\) Calculate EVM according to:

(here, EVM is relative and expressed in %)

(see Note: Formula for EVM)

### E.2.6.2 Peak Code Domain Error (PCDE)

The Peak Code Domain Error is calculated according to the following
steps:

1\) Take the error vectors **e** defined in clause E.2.6 (Form PCDE)

2\) To achieve meaningful results it is necessary to descramble **e,**
leading to **e'** (see Note: Scrambling code)

3\) Take the orthogonal vectors of the channelization code set **C**
(all codes belonging to one spreading factor) as defined in TS 25.213
and TS 25.223 (range +1, -1). (see Note: Symbol length) and normalize by
the norm of the vectors to produce **C**norm= **C**/sqrt(sf). (see Note:
Symbol length)

4\) Calculate the inner product of **e'** with **Cnorm**. Do this for
all symbols of the measurement interval and for all codes in the code
space.\
This gives an array of format k x ns, each value representing an
error-vector representing a specific symbol and a specific code, which
can be exploited in a variety of ways.

k: total number of codes in the code space

ns: number of symbols in the measurement interval

5\) Calculate k RMS values, each RMS value unifying ns symbols within
one code.\
(These values can be called \"*Absolute CodeEVMs*\" \[Volt\].)

6\) Find the peak value among the k \"*Absolute CodeEVMs*\".\
(This value can be called \"*Absolute PeakCodeEVM*\" \[Volt\].)

7\) Calculate PCDE according to:

(a relative value in dB).

(see Note IQ)

(see Note Synch channel)

### E.2.6.3 Relative Code Domain Error (RCDE)

The Relative Code Domain Error is calculated for a wanted code according
to the following steps:

1\) Calculate the value \"*Absolute CodeEVM*\" \[Volt\] for the wanted
code according to E.2.6.2, as an RMS value unifying ns = 2400 symbols
corresponding to the measurement interval of 1 frame.

2\) Calculate the value \"*Absolute CodeDomainPower* (CDP)\" \[Volt^2^\]
for the wanted code according to E.2.5.2, with ns = 2400 symbols
corresponding to the measurement interval of 1 frame.

3\) Calculate RCDE according to:

4\) The average RCDE across a set of wanted codes is defined as the mean
of the linear RCDE values and subsequently expressed in dB.

E.3 Notes
=========

E.3.1 Symbol length
-------------------

A general code multiplexed signal is multicode and multirate. In order
to avoid unnecessary complexity, the measurement applications use a
unique symbol-length, corresponding to a spreading factor, regardless of
the really intended spreading factor. Nevertheless the complexity with a
multicode / multirate signal can be mastered by introducing appropriate
definitions.

E.3.2 Deviation
---------------

It is conceivable to regard more parameters as type \"deviation\" e.g.
Chip frequency and RF-phase.

As chip-frequency and RF-frequency are linked together by a statement in
the core specifications \[1\] it is sufficient to process RF frequency
only.

A parameter RF-phase must be varied within the best fit process
(E.2.5.). Although necessary, this parameter-variation doesn't describe
any error, as the modulation schemes used in the system don't depend on
an absolute RF-phase.

The parameter Timing must be varied within the best fit process (E.2.5.)
This parameter variation does not describe any error, when applied to
the Node B test. However when applied to the UE test, it describes the
error of the UE's Timing Advance.

E.3.3 Residual
--------------

It is conceivable to regard more parameters as type „residual\" e.g. IQ
origin offset. As it is not the intention of the test to separate for
different error sources, but to quantify the quality of the signal, all
such parameters are not extracted by the best fit process, instead
remain part of EVM and PCDE.

E.3.4 Scrambling Code
---------------------

In general a signal under test can use more than one scrambling code.
Note that PCDE is primarily processed to investigate the unused
channelization codes. In order to know which scrambling code shall be
applied on unused channelization codes, it is necessary to restrict the
test conditions: The signal under test shall use exactly one scrambling
code.

E.3.5 IQ
--------

As in FDD/uplink each channelization code can be used twice, on the I
and on the Q channel, the measurement result may indicate separate
values of CDP or PCDE for I and Q on which channel (I or Q) they occur.

E.3.6 Synch Channel
-------------------

A Node B signal contains a physical synch channel, which is non
orthogonal, related to the other channels. In this context note: The
code channel bearing the result of PCDE is exactly one of the other
physical channels (never the synch channel). The origin of PCDE
(erroneous code power) can be any channel (including synch channel) This
means that the error due to the synch channel is projected onto the
other (orthogonal) codes that make up the code domain.

E.3.7 Formula for the minimum process
-------------------------------------

where:

L : the function to be minimised

The parameters to be varied in order to minimize are:

the RF frequency offset

the timing offset

the phase offset

code power offsets (one offset for each code)

the code power offset of the primary SCH

the code power offset of the secondary SCH

Z(ν) Samples of the signal under Test

R(ν) Samples of the reference signal

counting index starting at the beginning of the best fit interval and
ending at its end.

N No of chips during the best fit interval.

Z(ν): Samples of the signal under Test. It is modelled as a sequence of
complex baseband samples Z(γ) with a time-shift ∆t, a frequency offset
∆f, a phase offset ∆ϕ, the latter three with respect to the reference
signal.

R(ν) Samples of the reference signal:

where

g nominal gain of the code channel

The gain offset to be varied in the minimum process

Chip(ν) is the chipsequence of the code channel

Indices at g, Δg and Chip: The index indicates the code channel: c =
1,2,\... No of code channels

prim= primary SCH

sec= secondary SCH

Range for Chip~c~ : +1,-1

E.3.8 Power Step
----------------

If the measurement period for any code contains a power step due to
power control, it is necessary to model the reference signal for that
code using two gain factors.

E.3.9 Formula for EVM
---------------------

Z'(γ), R'(γ) are the varied measured and reference signals.

########  Annex F (informative): Derivation of Test Requirements

The Test Requirements in this specification have been calculated by
relaxing the Minimum Requirements of the core specification using the
Test Tolerances defined in clause 4.2. When the Test Tolerance is zero,
the Test Requirement will be the same as the Minimum Requirement. When
the Test Tolerance is non-zero, the Test Requirements will differ from
the Minimum Requirements, and the formula used for this relaxation is
given in tables F.1, F.2 and F.3

Note that a formula for applying Test Tolerances is provided for all
tests, even those with a test tolerance of zero. This is necessary in
the case that the Test System uncertainty is greater than that allowed
in clause 4.1. In this event, the excess error shall be subtracted from
the defined test tolerance in order to generate the correct tightened
Test Requirements as defined in clause 4.3.

For example, a Test System having 0.9 dB accuracy for test 6.2.1 Base
Station maximum output power (which is 0.2 dB above the limit specified
in clause 4.) would subtract 0.2 dB from the Test Tolerance of 0.7 dB
defined in clause 4.2. This new test tolerance of 0.5 dB would then be
applied to the Minimum Requirement using the formula defined in Table
F.1 to give a new range of ±2.5 dB of the manufacturer\'s rated output
power.

Using this same approach for the case where a test had a test tolerance
of 0 dB, an excess error of 0.2 dB would result in a modified test
tolerance of -0.2 dB.

########  Annex G (informative): Acceptable uncertainty of Test Equipment

This informative annex specifies the critical parameters of the
components of an overall Test System (e.g. Signal generators, Signal
Analysers etc.) which are necessary when assembling a Test System which
complies with clause 4.1 Acceptable Uncertainty of Test System. These
Test Equipment parameters are fundamental to the accuracy of the overall
Test System and are unlikely to be improved upon through System
Calibration.

########  Annex H (Informative): UTRAN Measurement Test Cases

H.1 Purpose of Annex
====================

This Annex specifies test specific parameters for some of the UTRAN
requirements in chapter 9.2 TS 25.133. The tests provide additional
information to how the requirements should be tested. Some requirements
may lack a test.

Unless explicitly stated:

\- Measurement channel is 12.2 kbps as defined in TS 25.104 annex A,
sub-clause A.2 for UL measurements

\- Test models defined in TS 25.141 sub-clause 6.1 are used for DL
measurements

H.2 Received Total Wideband Power
=================================

H.2.1 Absolute RTWP measurement
-------------------------------

1\. Terminate the BS RX inputs, measure the RTWP and record it.

2\. Attach a signal generator to the RX input connector and increase the
power until the BS reported RTWP value (Irep) has increased 3 dB.

3\. Measure the signal power level delivered from the signal generator.
This signal level is now called the \"Internally generated noise\" (Ni).

4\. Sweep the signal generator power such that the sum of internally
generated noise (Ni) and signal generator power (I) is swept through the
defined conditions range.

5\. Check that: \|(Ni+I)-Irep\| meets the accuracy requirements
specified in chapter 9.2.1.1

Note that Iob= (Ni+I)

H.2.2 Relative RTWP measurement
-------------------------------

1\. Terminate the BS RX inputs, measure the RTWP and record it.

2\. Attach a signal generator to the RX input connector and increase the
power until the BS reported RTWP value (Irep) has increased 3 dB.

3\. Measure the signal power level delivered from the signal generator.
This signal level is now called the \"Internally generated noise\" (Ni).

4\. Sweep the signal generator power such that the sum of internally
generated noise (Ni) and signal generator power (I) is swept through the
defined conditions range.

5\. The difference between the reported RTWP values shall meet the
accuracy requirements specified in chapter 9.2.1.2.

Note that Iob= (Ni+I)

H.3 Transmitted code power
==========================

1\. Generate the wanted signal in accordance to test model 2, clause
6.1.1.2. Set power of the DPCH under test to the Pmax,c-3 dB level.
Power levels for other code channels shall be adjusted as necessary.

2\. Measure the output power on code channel under test, Pout,code, at
the antenna connector. Record the transmitted code power reported in the
BS, Pcode.

3\. Check that Pout,code meets the absolute accuracy requirement in TS
25.133 chapter 9.2.5.1. If STTD or closed loop transmit diversity is
supported by the BS, the transmitted code power for each branch are
measured, summed together and reported to higher layers. In case of TX
diversity or MIMO transmission both branches need to be measured and
summed together in order to find out the wanted value. The absolute
accuracy of Pcode can be accepted if Pout,code will fullfill the
following conditions:

Pcode-3.9 dB ≤ Pout,code ≤ Pcode + 3.9 dB, f ≤ 3.0 GHz;

Pcode-4.2 dB ≤ Pout,code ≤ Pcode + 4.2 dB, 3.0 GHz \< f ≤ 4.2 GHz

4\. Check that the relative accuracy requirement for Pcode in TS 25.133
chapter 9.2.5.2 is met. Set Pcode1 and Pcode2 to transmit with the same
power level. The relative accuracy between Pcode1 and Pcode2 can be
accepted if the difference between the measured power of one code
channel, Pout,code1 and another code channel Pout,code 2 will fullfill
the following conditions:

 Pout,code1 - Pout,code2  ≤ 2.2 dB.

5\. Set the power of the DPCH under test to the minimum power of the
power control dynamic range and repeat steps 2, 3 and 4.

H.4 Transmitted carrier power
=============================

1\) Set the BS to transmit with the maximum transmission power and
measure the output power at the antenna connector, PMTP. Maximum
transmission power is the mean power on one carrier measured at the
antenna connector with the code level settings that according to the
base station manufacturer will result in an output power of nominally
the maximum output power in a specified reference condition. Test model
2, clause 6.1.1.2, when the code powers are set according to table 6.3.
shall be used.

2\) Operate the BS in closed loop power control until the output power
has reached a stable state. Measure the output power, Pout, at the
antenna connector and record the transmitted carrier power measured and
reported in the BS, Prep. Note that Prep is normalised to the output
power measured in Test Model 2 with all codes at their default levels.
If STTD or closed loop transmit diversity is supported by the BS, only
the highest of the transmit powers is reported to higher layers. In case
of TX diversity or MIMO transmission both branches need to be measured
in order to find out which one is the highest.

3\) Check that the Pout meets the requirement in TS 25.133 chapter
9.2.4.1, with the same test equipment accuracy as in chapter 6.4.4. in
TS 25.141. Prep can be accepted if Pout will fullfill the following
conditions:

\[ dBm\]

4\) Repeat step 2 and 3 over the 5%-95% range of the Prep. Use first the
standard code powers of test model 2 to verify the Prep range from 50%
to 95%. After that put the other dedicated channels off and reduce the
powers of the control codes in order to be able to verify the Prep range
from 5% to 50%.

NOTE: Pout shall be tested immediately after PMTP in order to avoid the
influence of long term stability variation to measurement results.

########  Annex I (normative): Characteristics of the W-CDMA interference signal

The W-CDMA interference signal shall be a DPCH containing the DPCCH and
one DPDCH. The data content for each channelization code shall be
uncorrelated with each other and to the wanted signal and spread and
modulated according to clause 4 of TS25.213 \[14\]. Further
characteristics of DPDCH and DPCCH are specified in table I.1.

Table I.1.: Characteristics of the W-CDMA interference signal

  --------- ---------- ------------------ --------------------- ----------------
  Channel   Bit Rate   Spreading Factor   Channelization Code   Relative Power
  DPDCH     240 kbps   16                 4                     0 dB
  DPCCH     15 kbps    256                0                     -5.46 dB
  --------- ---------- ------------------ --------------------- ----------------

NOTE: The DPDCH and DPCCH settings are chosen to simulate a signal with
realistic Peak to Average Ratio.
