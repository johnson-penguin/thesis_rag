3 Definitions, symbols and abbreviations
========================================

3.1 Definitions
---------------

For the purposes of the present document, the following terms and
definitions apply.

Figure 3.1: MBMS Timeline, based on \[4\].

**MBMS session start** is the point at which the BM-SC is ready to send
data.

**MBMS notification** informs the UEs about forthcoming and about
ongoing MBMS data transfer.

**MBMS Cell Group** is a group of multiple cells belonging to one RNS
and sharing one PDCP and RLC entity to utilize p-t-m transmission of the
MBMS Service

**MBMS session stop** is the point at which the BM-SC determines that
there will be no more data to send for some period of time.

**Data transfer** is the phase when MBMS data are transferred to the
UEs.

**MBMS service availability** is the phase between start of service
announcement and the end of the last session or stop of service
announcement.

**MBMS Iu data bearer** denotes the data bearer established between SGSN
and RNC to transport MBMS data

**MBMS radio bearer** denotes the data bearer established between RNC
and UE(s) to transport MBMS data

**MBMS RAB** denotes both, the MBMS Iu data bearer and the MBMS radio
bearer

**MBMS Service Context** contains the necessary information for the
UTRAN to control the MBMS Service in UTRAN.

**MBMS Activated Services:** a set of services made up of those in MBMS
multicast mode that the UE has joined as well as those in MBMS broadcast
mode that the UE is interested in receiving.

**MBMS Selected Services:** a subset of the MBMS activated services in
MBMS Broadcast mode for which the UE applies RRC procedures to inform
UTRAN that the service has been selected (by upper layers).

**MBMS Iu signalling connection** denotes the signalling connection
established between the RNC and the CN node to serve one MBMS Service
Context.

**MBMS Service Announcement:** Mechanism to allow users to be informed
about the MBMS services available \[4\]

**Pool area**: see definition in ref.\[6\]

**MBMS Multicast Service Activation**: see description in ref.\[4\]

**Critical Information**: MBMS Neighbouring Cell Information, MBMS Radio
Bearer Information and MBMS Service Information sent on MCCH.

**Non-critical information**: MBMS Access Information sent on MCCH.

**MBMS Service Area:** The area in which a specific MBMS session is made
available. Each transmission and retransmission of an MBMS session of an
MBMS Bearer Service may be made available to a different MBMS Service
Area. The MBMS Service Area is described by a list of MBMS Service Area
IDs, where each MBMS Service Area ID represents a group of cells. The
definition of an MBMS Service Area ID is independent of an MBMS session,
and of an MBMS Bearer Service. \[4\]

**L1-combining schedule:** Indicates when the soft combining is
applicable between the specific S-CCPCH of the cell and the specific
S-CCPCH of the neighbouring cell.

**MBMS Single Frequency Network:** A simulcast transmission technique
realised by transmission of identical waveforms at the same time via a
group of cells covering a geographic area.

**MBSFN mode:** In order to achieve higher spectral efficiency
synchronized cells operate in MBSFN mode which implies that they
transmit exactly the same content over an area that is seen as one MBSFN
cell by the UE.

**MBSFN cluster:** Set of cells operating in MBSFN mode providing only
MBMS service in PtM mode and seen as one cell by a UE.

**MBMS service transmission schedule:** Indicates when the specific MBMS
service is expected to be transmitted in the cell in specific S-CCPCH.
The information is transmitted on MSCH

**S-CCPCH:** In case of TDD, the S-CCPCH refers to the CCTrCH carrying
FACH. In case of 3.84 Mcps TDD MBSFN IMB, the S-CCPCH refers either to
S-CCPCH frame type 1 or S-CCPCH frame type 2, or both S-CCPCH frame type
1 and S-CCPCH frame type 2.

**UE Link** denotes the stored information in the RNC on MBMS services
joined by the UE in the state other than URA\_PCH in the course of the
UE Linking procedure.

**URA Link** denotes the stored information in the RNC on MBMS services
joined by a UE in URA\_PCH state in the course of the URA Linking
procedure.

**MBMS Master RNC**: role an RNC can take with respect to one or more
specific MBSFN cluster(s). MRNC may be used for Inter-RNC MBSFN
operation whenever dynamic synchronization of radio resources used for
MBMS services is centrally controlled. There is only one MBMS Master RNC
for any MBSFN cluster, which may control one or more MBSFN cluster(s).
The MRNC has the overall control of the logical resources of the RNSs
that are used for MBSFN operation within the MBSFN cluster(s).

**Synchronisation Sequence:** Each SYNC PDU contains a time stamp which
indicates the start time of the synchronisation sequence. Each
synchronisation sequence has the same duration which is configured in
the BM-SC and the RNCs operating in inter-RNC synchronisation mode.

**Synchronisation Period:** The synchronisation period provides the time
reference for the indication of the start time of each synchronisation
sequence. The time stamp which is provided in each SYNC PDU is a
relative value which refers to the start time of the synchronisation
period. The duration of the synchronisation period is configurable.

4 Background and introduction
=============================

The Introduction of the Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service in UTRA
describes techniques for optimised transmission of MBMS bearer service
in UTRA such as point-to-multipoint transmission, selective combining
and transmission mode selection between point-to-multipoint and
point-to-point bearer.

The Stage 1 MBMS service requirements are defined in \[2\] and MBMS
Stage 1 user services are defined in \[3\]. UTRAN (and GERAN)
requirements are covered in TR 25.992 \[5\]. The overall architecture,
functional description and the reference architecture of MBMS are
covered in TS 23.246 \[3\].

5 MBMS UTRAN and protocol architecture
======================================

5.1 MBMS UTRAN architecture principles
--------------------------------------

### 5.1.1 MBMS Service Context in CRNC

Each RNC-which is controlling one or several cells within an MBMS
Service area maintains an MBMS Service Context for each MBMS service.

1.  Each CRNC MBMS Service Context is associated with an MBMS service
    ID, i.e. TMGI.

2.  The CRNC MBMS Service Context contains a list of PMM connected mode
    UEs which are present in one or several cells of the CRNC and which
    have activated the MBMS service and/or a list of URAs in which there
    is at least one URA\_PCH UE which has activated the MBMS service.
    The list includes at least the U-RNTI of the UEs in the state other
    than URA\_PCH and/or URA-IDs.

NOTE: The MBMS Service Context in the CRNC contains no information about
RRC Idle mode UEs.

3.  The MBMS Service Context is created in the CRNC either

-   if the SGSN informs the RNC that a UE has activated the MBMS Service
    in a cell controlled by the CRNC by the UE Linking procedure. In
    this case, the CRNC is the SRNC of the UE,

-   or if the RNC is notified of an MBMS Session Start,

-   or if the RNC serves as a Drift RNC for a PMM-CONNECTED UE and
    receives for this UE a UE Link from the SRNC containing the MBMS
    Service Id of the concerned MBMS Service,

> \- or if the RNC receives a URA Link containing the MBMS Service Id of
> the concerned MBMS Service.

4.  Each RNC which is informed by the SGSN that a UE has activated one
    (or several) MBMS Service(s) by the UE Linking procedure maintains
    an MBMS Service Context for each indicated MBMS service,
    irrespectively of the MBMS Service Area.

5.  The MBMS Service Context is released by the CRNC either

-   if the MBMS Service Context does not contain any UE/URA information
    after a UE/URA Unlinking procedure from a SGSN and there is no
    active MBMS Session for the concerned MBMS Service,

-   or if the MBMS Service Context does not contain any UE Link/URA Link
    at the time of a Session Stop

-   or if the RNC receives a CN De-Registration for MBMS Service

6.  Associated functionalities:

    1.  Bearer type selection for MBMS transmissions based on
        > information in the CRNC MBMS Service Context. The decision
        > process requires inter-working with Radio Resource Management
        > and with the UE\'s SRNC in the case of p-t-p bearers.

    2.  MBMS RB control for p-t-m bearers in each cell, based on
        > information in the CRNC MBMS Service Context.

    3.  Update of the MBMS Service Context when a PMM-CONNECTED UE,
        > which has activated an MBMS Service, has entered a cell.
        > Update of the MBMS Service Context via Iur is performed by UE
        > Linking.

    4.  Update of the MBMS Service Context when a PMM-CONNECTED UE,
        > which has activated an MBMS Service, has left a cell. Update
        > of the MBMS Service Context via Iur is performed by UE
        > Un-Linking.

NOTE: For further details of UE linking via the Iur interface see
chapter 5.1.6.

### 5.1.2 MBMS Session start and MBMS Session Stop

At MBMS Session Start and MBMS Session Stop the RNC receives a
respective request from the CN. The MBMS Session Start Request shall
contain the MBMS Service Id, MBMS Bearer Service Type and MBMS Session
Attributes (MBMS Service Area Information, QoS parameters, ...). The
MBMS Session Start Request triggers the RNC to notify UEs, which have
activated the MBMS Service of the MBMS Session Start. The MBMS Session
Stop Request may trigger the RNC to notify UEs, which have activated the
MBMS Service of the MBMS Session Stop.

The MBMS Session Start and Session Stop procedures provide the setup and
release of the MBMS RAB in the following way:

The MBMS Session Start Request shall contain all information necessary
to setup an MBMS RAB. When the RNC receives an MBMS Session Start
Request, it typically executes MBMS Iu data bearer set up and shall
inform the sending CN node, of the outcome in the MBMS Session Start
response message.

Upon reception of MBMS Session Start Request, if the MBMS Service
Context is not yet present in the RNC, the RNC shall store the MBMS
Service Id. Further the RNC shall memorise the MBMS Bearer Service Type,
MBMS Counting Information, MBMS Counting Information and MBMS Session
Attributes (MBMS Service Area Information, QoS parameters, ...) as part
of the MBMS Service Context.

The RNC may choose not to execute the MBMS Iu data bearer setup, for a
particular MBMS service, when:

1.  The RNC does not control any cell contained within the MBMS Service
    > Area, or

2.  The RNC controls at least one cell contained within the MBMS Service
    > Area and a list of PMM-Idle Mode UEs is included in MBMS Session
    > Start but no RA's contained within the list are under the control
    > of the RNC

The RNC may not execute the MBMS Iu data bearer setup for a given Iu
interface in case of Iu-flex. In those cases the CN node shall be
informed accordingly.

In case of Iu-flex, the RNC might receive more than one MBMS Session
Start Request for an MBMS Service and shall not set up more than one
MBMS Iu bearer for a certain MBMS Service towards a pool area.

When the RNC receives an MBMS Session Stop Request it shall release the
associated MBMS RAB resources.

The MBMS Session Start and Session Stop procedures serve to establish
and release the MBMS Iu signalling connection.

### 5.1.3 MBMS Iu bearer 

For each MBMS service, data is transferred via an MBMS RAB between the
SGSN and the UE. For each MBMS service, data is transferred via one MBMS
Iu bearer between SGSN and the RNC in the whole MBMS Service area.
Signalling messages specific for an MBMS Service are transferred via one
dedicated MBMS Iu signalling connection between the RNC and the SGSN.

1.  One MBMS Iu bearer is established per MBMS service at MBMS Session
    > Start.

2.  Regarding Iu-flex the RNC shall not set up more than one MBMS Iu
    > bearer.

3.  Because of the dedicated channels and Iur mobility, there is a need
    > to send MBMS data to an RNC which is not necessarily part of the
    > MBMS Service area.

4.  The MBMS Iu bearer on Iu is established per MBMS service and not per
    > UE individually.

5.  Each PMM-CONNECTED mode UE with an activated MBMS service has its UE
    > context bind to the MBMS Iu bearer.

6.  There could be several MBMS RBs linked to one MBMS Iu bearer (i.e.
    > one MBMS Iu bearer on Iu maybe mapped to multiple DTCH and/or or
    > p-t-m traffic channels over the radio -interface).

### 5.1.4 MBMS Iub bearer

The existing FACH transport channel mechanism over Iub is to be used in
case of p-t-m MBMS transmission.

### 5.1.5 Mapping of MBMS Iu bearer to p-t-p and p-t-m connections

The service specific MBMS RAB on Iu may be mapped to p-t-m bearers in
order to provide MBMS data via common channels.

1.  The MBMS control function in the CRNC may decide to establish a
    > p-t-m connection, if the number of counted MBMS users in a cell
    > exceeds a certain operator-defined threshold or if the MBMS
    > Counting Information indicates that MBMS Counting procedures are
    > not applicable.

2.  The MBMS control function in the CRNC may decide to establish a
    > p-t-m connection depending on the congestion scenario expected for
    > a specific cell (e.g. in hotspot areas where no bearer type
    > switching is needed). and/or the MBMS service characteristics
    > (e.g. session duration time) on a per cell basis.

3.  The MBMS control function in the CRNC may, through a configurable
    > parameter enable/disable bearer type switching and the associated
    > procedures on a per cell basis.

4.  The MBMS control function in the CRNC establishes an MBMS RB by
    > sending service specific signalling messages (e.g. MBMS RB Setup
    > message) to all the UEs in the cell listening MBMS
    > point-to-multipoint control channel (MCCH). UEs with activated
    > service(s) may then execute the RB set-up.

5.  MBMS data is transferred on an MBMS point-to-multipoint traffic
    > channel (MTCH) to all the UEs which have executed the RB setup.

6.  The MBMS control function in the CRNC releases the MBMS RB (e.g.
    > MBMS RB Release) when the data transfer has been finished or it
    > has been interrupted by the CRNC.

7.  p-t-p transmission of MBMS data should use the DTCH as defined for
    > other dedicated services.

8.  p-t-m transmission of MBMS data applies to all RRC states and modes.

### 5.1.6 UE Linking/De-linking

UE Linking denotes the process where a UE, which has joined one or
several MBMS services, is linked to one or several MBMS service context
in the RNC.

MBMS UE linking procedure in the SRNC is performed in following cases.

1\. When the UE, which has joined an MBMS service, is moved to
PMM-CONNECTED and sets up a PS RAB This may happen at any point in time
during the whole MBMS service availability (i.e. before, during and
between MBMS sessions).

2\. When the UE joins an MBMS service and is in PMM-CONNECTED due to an
existing PS RAB. This may happen at any point in time during the whole
MBMS service availability (i.e. before, during and between MBMS
sessions).

3\. When the UE is moved to PMM-CONNECTED only for MBMS purpose, e.g. to
respond to counting/recounting indication or respond to p-t-p bearer
indication from RNC. This may happen at any point in time during MBMS
sessions.

4\. When the UE is moved to PMM-CONNECTED and the UE provides MBMS
Selected Services Information to the RNC.

Keeping UEs in PMM-CONNECTED only for MBMS between sessions is
implementation specific. The UE linking in the SRNC for services
delivered over MBMS Multicast mode is performed via UE dedicated Iu
procedures. An entry for the UE is added to the related MBMS service
context(s) in the SRNC. If an MBMS service context doesn\'t exist yet it
needs to be created.

In cases where a UE is present in a cell under the control of a drift
RNC, the UE Linking is performed via Iur in the following way.

1.  When the UE, which has activated one or several MBMS services, is in
    CELL\_DCH state and starts to consume radio resources from one or
    several cells controlled by the DRNC, MBMS UE Linking in the DRNC is
    performed via UE dedicated Iur procedures. After that the DRNC shall
    update the MBMS Service context on the request of every radio link
    setup/release from the SRNC.

2.  When the UE, which has activated one or several MBMS services, is in
    CELL\_FACH state and starts to consume radio resources from one cell
    controlled by the DRNC, MBMS UE Linking in the DRNC is performed via
    UE dedicated Iur procedures. After that the DRNC shall update the
    MBMS Service context in the DRNC at every intra-DRNC cell change
    without the need to receive UE Link from the SRNC.

> 3\. If the UE is in CELL\_DCH and CELL\_FACH state and there is no
> dedicated RNL signalling activity ongoing for this UE and UE Linking
> is performed in the SRNC for an MBMS Service, MBMS UE Linking in the
> DRNC is performed via the MBMS Attach procedure.
>
> 4 If the UE is in CELL\_PCH and moves to a cell within the DRNC area
> for the first time, the MBMS UE Linking in the DRNC is performed. The
> cell the UE moved to is indicated to the DRNC. After that at every
> intra-DRNC cell change the DRNC shall update the MBMS Service context
> in the DRNC without the need to receive UE Link from the SRNC.
>
> 5\. If the UE is in CELL\_PCH and there is no mobility related
> signalling activity ongoing for this UE and UE Linking is performed in
> the SRNC for an MBMS Service, MBMS UE Linking in the DRNC is performed
> via the MBMS Attach procedure.
>
> 6 If the UE is in RRC connected mode and UE Linking is performed in
> the SRNC for an MBMS Service and a session of this MBMS Service is
> ongoing UE Linking in the DRNC needs to be performed immediately.
>
> At MBMS UE linking in the DRNC the MBMS service context in the DRNC
> needs to be updated. If an MBMS service context does not exist yet
> then it shall be created and if needed, DRNC can acquire the APN and
> IP Multicast Address from the SRNC for the specific service via
> Information Exchange procedure.
>
> UE De-linking denotes the process where a UE, which has joined MBMS
> service(s), is removed from one or several MBMS service contexts in
> the RNC.
>
> MBMS UE De-linking procedure in the SRNC is performed in following
> cases.

1.  When the UE has left the MBMS service and is in PMM-CONNECTED due to
    an existing PS RAB. This may happen at any point in time during the
    whole MBMS service availability (i.e. before, during and between
    MBMS sessions).

2.  When the UE sends new MBMS Selected Services Information to the RNC
    omitting an MBMS service which is identified on the MCCH.

3.  When CN decides to de-link a certain PMM-CONNECTED mode UE due to
    e.g. error cases.

MBMS UE De-linking in the SRNC for services in MBMS Multicast mode is
performed via UE dedicated Iu procedure. The entry for the UE is removed
from the concerned MBMS service context(s) in the SRNC.

MBMS UE De-linking procedure in the DRNC is performed via Iur in the
following way:

1.  If the UE is in CELL\_DCH or CELL\_FACH state and stops consuming
    the radio resources from one or several cells controlled by the
    DRNC, MBMS UE is De-linked from the MBMS Service Context in the DRNC
    via UE dedicated Iur procedure.

2.  If the UE is in CELL\_DCH or CELL\_FACH state and there is no
    dedicated RNL signalling activity ongoing for this UE and UE
    De-linking is performed in the SRNC for an MBMS Service, MBMS UE
    De-linking in the DRNC is performed via the MBMS Detach procedure.

> 3 If the UE is in CELL\_PCH and leaves for a cell out of the DRNC area
> the UE is delinked from the MBMS Service context in the DRNC via the
> MBMS Detach procedure. The cell the UE moved out of is indicated to
> the DRNC.
>
> 4\. If the UE is in RRC connected mode and UE De-linking is performed
> in the SRNC for an MBMS Service and a session of this MBMS Service is
> ongoing UE De-linking in the DRNC needs to be performed immediately.

### 5.1.7 RNC Registration

RNC Registration for a certain MBMS Service denotes the process where
the CN becomes aware of an RNC hosting UEs, which have activated that
MBMS Service.

Due to UE mobility, a RNC with no MBMS Service Context, can be informed
that a PMM-CONNECTED UE, which has entered the cell, has activated an
MBMS Service by means of the MBMS UE Linking procedure via the Iur
interface. Then the RNC informs the CN that it would like to receive
MBMS Session Start Request messages when applicable for the concerned
MBMS Service by sending MBMS Registration Request message.

It results in the set-up of a corresponding MBMS distribution tree, but
it does not result in the establishment of Iu user plane, which will be
established by the MBMS Session Start procedure.

1.  Implicit Registration

-   RNC Registration for Serving RNCs is performed implicitly, i.e. due
    to UE linking and MBMS Multicast Service Activation. No explicit
    registration procedure needs to be performed.

2.  Explicit Registration

-   RNC Registration for Drift RNCs is performed explicitly if an RNC
    becomes a Drift RNC for a UE, which has activated an MBMS service
    and has no MBMS Service Context for that MBMS Service.

-   RNC Registration for Drift RNCs is performed explicitly if an RNC is
    no longer the SRNC of any connected UE which has activated an MBMS
    service, but hosts at least a UE which consumes radio resources of
    the RNC via Iur. This shall happen only before sessions or between
    sessions.

-   The DRNC will perform a registration towards its default CN node
    only.

### 5.1.8 RNC De-Registration

RNC De-Registration for a certain MBMS Service denotes the process where
the CN becomes aware that an RNC registered at a CN node does not host
any more PMM-CONNECTED UEs which have activated that MBMS Service.

-   Implicit RNC De-Registration

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   RNC De-Registration for Serving RNCs is performed implicitly, i.e
    due to UE Unlinking and MBMS Multicast Service Deactivation. No
    explicit de-registration procedure needs to be performed.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Explicit RNC De-Registration

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   RNC De-Registration for Drift RNCs is performed explicitly if a RNC
    is not acting as a Serving RNC and has ceased to act as a Drift RNC
    for UEs which have activated an MBMS service, it will perform a
    de-registration towards the CN node it was registered to.

-   The timing of RNC De-Registration is implementation specific.

NOTE: When the Drift RNC performes the explicit De-registration, the
Implicit registration may still remain and in that case Iu data bearer
should not be removed.

### 5.1.9 CN De-Registration 

CN De-Registration denotes the process where the CN informs the RNC that
a certain MBMS service is no longer available. CN De-Registration should
result in releasing of all associated MBMS Service Contexts and
resources.

The CN De-Registration procedure serves to release the MBMS Iu
signalling connection.

### 5.1.10 URA Linking/De-linking

URA Linking denotes the process where a URA, which contains one or more
cells in which at least one URA\_PCH UE has joined the MBMS service or
has passed MBMS Selected Service Information about the MBMS service, is
linked to an MBMS service context in the RNC. An entry for the URA is
added to the MBMS service context in the RNC.

If the UE in URA\_PCH state, which has activated one or several MBMS
Services, is present within a URA containing one or more cells that are
controlled by one or more drift RNCs, the URA Linking is performed in
the following way.

> 1\. If the UE is in URA\_PCH, having activated one or more MBMS
> services, is the first UE for the particular MBMS service to move to a
> URA which contains one or more cells that are controlled by one or
> more DRNCs, the URA is linked to the MBMS Service context in each
> applicable DRNC. The URA the UE moved to will be indicated.
>
> 2\. As long as the SRNC serves UEs in URA\_PCH in URAs containing
> cells controlled by one or more DRNCs, the SRNC shall keep the other
> RNCs informed about every URA in which UEs having activated certain
> MBMS services have to be notified. This is done when the first UE
> enters the URA, by indicating to the other RNCs a list of URAs and the
> corresponding MBMS Services via MBMS Attach procedure.

NOTE: Bullet points 1 and 2 above may be merged in a future version of
this document.

At MBMS URA linking in the RNC the MBMS service context in the RNC needs
to be updated. If an MBMS service context does not exist yet then it
shall be created and acquire the APN and IP Multicast Address from the
SRNC for the specific service via Information Exchange procedure.

URA De-linking denotes the process where a URA is removed from one or
several MBMS service contexts in the RNC.

> 1\. If the UE is in URA\_PCH and, for the particular MBMS service, is
> the last UE to leave a URA which contains one or more cells controlled
> by one or more DRNCs the URA is de-linked from the MBMS Service
> context in each applicable DRNC via the MBMS Detach procedure.

### 5.1.11 IP Multicast Distribution

To improve the transport efficiency the IP Multicast may be used for the
MBMS payload distribution in the backbone network between the GGSN and
the RNCs, bypassing the SGSN.

The GGSN allocates during the session start the Transport Layer Address
used for the IP-multicast and the DL TEID used for the Iu Transport
association. The RNCs will receive these parameters from SGSN in the
Session Start message as part of the MBMS session attributes.

The RNC may accept or reject the proposed IP Multicast distribution in
the MBMS Session Start Response to the SGSN. If accepted the RNC shall
report the channel (IP Multicast and Source address) to the backbone in
order to join the bearer service multicast distribution. If one or more
downstream RNC nodes doesn't accept IP Multicast distribution, the SGSN
will establish an MBMS RAB which the IP multicast distribution is not
applied, to related RNCs.

The MBMS payload is forwarded by the GGSN towards the IP Multicast
address. The RNCs joined to that IP Multicast address will receive the
user data packets (SYNC PDU) together with the synchronisation-related
information in header part of SYNC PDU. The information in header part
of SYNC PDU is delivered to allow the softcombining and MBSFN
transmission across the RNCs. The details of inter-RNC synchronization
are described in section 7.1B.

In case the header compression is used in MBMS PtM mode for an MBMS
stream the compression is done in BM-SC. The usage of header compression
is configured in advance in the BM-SC and the RNC is receiving the
information during the MBMS Session start as part of the session
attributes. In case header compression is configured, the MBMS user data
packets forwarded from BM-SC to RNCs via GGSN will contain in addition
to the synchronisation-related information and PDCP protocol
information, the full IP header of the payload and the payload with
compressed header. The RNC using MBMS PtP mode in a cell may process the
UE dedicated RoHC for the full IP header of the payload and replace the
compressed header of PtM mode with it.

5.2 MBMS Uu Principles
----------------------

### 5.2.1 MBMS Service States in UE

The MBMS bearer service has following service states in the UE:

1.  Not active, UE has not joined any MBMS multicast service or not
    activated the broadcast mode of the MBMS

2.  Not active, UE has joined at least one MBMS multicast service and/or
    activated the broadcast mode of the MBMS, but MBMS SYSTEM
    INFORMATION is not broadcasted on BCCH.

3.  Active, UE has joined at least one MBMS multicast service and/or
    activated the broadcast mode of the MBMS, but any of the services
    that UE has joined (interested in broadcast mode) is not being
    transmitted. UE monitors MICH to find modifications in the MCCH as
    defined in 5.1.6

4.  Active; at least one MBMS service appearing in the list of MBMS
    Activated Services, is received on p-t-m

> \- UE is receiving MBMS transmission on MTCH
>
> \- UE is using DRX based on scheduling information informing that
> coming MTCH transmission is not in the interest of the UE.
>
> 5\. Active; at least one MBMS service is received on p-t-p
>
> 6\. Active; at least one MBMS service is received on p-t-p and at
> least one MBMS service is received on p-t-m. (only valid if UE has
> capability to support this combination)

When MBMS transmission is started in cell the UE moves from state 3 to
either state 4 or state 5 (6), depending on p‑t‑p transmission mode and
after MBMS transmission ends in the cell, the UE moves from state 4 or
state 5 (6) to state 3.

### 5.2.2 One PDCP and RLC entity shared among multiple cells within one RNS

For each MBMS service, a group of multiple cells belonging to one RNS
shares one PDCP entity and RLC entity over p-t-m transmission. The group
of multiple cells is called \'MBMS Cell Group\'.

1.  There are one or more MBMS Cell Groups per RNS. The MBMS Cell Groups
    are managed by the CRNC.

2.  There are one or more cells pertaining to the same RNS for one MBMS
    Cell Group.

3.  The MBMS Cell Group identity is used to uniquely identify a group of
    multiple cells, which for each MBMS service share the same PDCP
    entity and RLC entity within an RNS.

In case the MBMS combining methods are used across multiple RNSs for an
MBMS service, the RNSs belong to the same IP Multicast group used for
the MBMS user data distribution from the GGSN to CRNCs. One common PDCP
entity for header compression is used for MBMS P-t-M transmission among
the RNSs being part of the IP Multicast group.

The RLC entity for p-t-m transmission is shared by a group of multiple
cells belonging to one RNS. The RLC entities, within the RNSs shall be
synchronized to each other in way that they, process the user data in
the same manner with the help of information delivered by the
SYNC-protocol to RNS.

### 5.2.3 MCCH Information Scheduling

The MCCH information will be transmitted based on a fixed schedule. This
schedule will identify the TTI containing the beginning of the MCCH
information. The transmission of this information may take a variable
number of TTIs and the UTRAN should transmit MCCH information in
consecutive TTIs. The UE will keep receiving the S-CCPCH until:

-   It receives all of the MCCH information, or

-   It receives a TTI that does not include any MCCH data, or

-   The information contents indicate that further reception is not
    required (e.g. no modification to the desired service information).

Based on this behaviour, the UTRAN may repeat the MCCH information
following a scheduled transmission in order to improve reliability. The
MCCH schedule will be common for all services.

The entire MCCH information will be transmitted periodically based on a
\"repetition period\". The \"modification period\" will be defined as an
integer multiple of the repetition period. The MBMS ACCESS INFORMATION
may be transmitted periodically based on an \"access info period\". This
period will be an integer divider of the \"repetition period\".

MCCH information is split into critical and non-critical information.
The critical information is made up of the MBMS NEIGHBOURING CELL
INFORMATION, MBMS SERVICE INFORMATION and MBMS RADIO BEARER INFORMATION.
The non-critical information corresponds to the MBMS ACCESS INFORMATION.
Changes to critical information will only be applied at the first MCCH
transmission of a modification period and in the beginning of each
modification period UTRAN transmits the MBMS CHANGE INFORMATION
including MBMS services ids whose MCCH information is modified at that
modification period. MBMS CHANGE INFORMATION is repeated at least once
in each repetition period of that modification period. Changes to
non-critical information could take place at any time.

The Figure 5.2.3 below illustrates the schedule with which the MBMS
SERVICE INFORMATION and RADIO BEARER INFORMATION would be transmitted.
Different colours indicate potentially different MCCH content.

Figure 5.2.3: MCCH Information Schedule

### 5.2.4 MBMS Notification

The MBMS notification mechanism is used to inform UEs of an upcoming
change in critical MCCH information. Notifications are based on service
groups. The mapping between service IDs and service groups is specified
in \[11\].

The MBMS notification indicators will be sent on an MBMS specific PICH,
called the MICH. A single MICH frame will be able to carry indications
for every service-group.

Critical MCCH information can only be changed at the beginning of a
modification period as described in Section 5.2.3. The MBMS notification
indicator corresponding to the service group of every affected service
shall be set continuously during the entire modification period
preceding the first change in MCCH information related to a given
service. Subsequent changes in the MCCH information in the next
modification period related to the same service can be signalled on the
MCCH.

UEs which are not receiving any MBMS service on MTCH or p-t-p channel
are free to read the MBMS notification at any time; however the
modification interval shall be long enough so that UEs are able to
reliably detect it even if they only receive the MICH during their
regular Release \'99 paging occasions.

Upon detecting the MBMS notification indication for a service group, UEs
with an activated service service corresponding to this group shall
start reading the MCCH at the beginning of the next modification period.
The UE shall read at least MBMS CHANGE INFORMATION.

The Figure 5.2.4 below illustrates the timing relation between the
setting of the MICH and the first MCCH critical information change. The
green colour for the MICH indicates when the NI is set for the service.
For the MCCH, different colours indicate MCCH content related to the
notification of different services.

UEs, which are receiving MBMS service(s) on MTCH in idle mode or
URA\_PCH, CELL\_PCH, or CELL\_FACH state shall read the MCCH at the
beginning of the each modification period to receive the MBMS CHANGE
INFORMATION, which will indicate MBMS service Ids and optionally MBMS
Session ID whose MCCH information is modified at that modification
period. If MBMS service Id and optionally MBMS Session ID, which UE has
activated, is indicated in MBMS CHANGE INFORMATION the UE shall read the
rest of the MCCH information.

Figure 5.2.4: Illustration of MICH timing relative to Modification
period

### 5.2.5 MBMS Counting

MBMS Counting is used to determine the optimum transmission mechanism
for a given service.

1.  The need for counting is indicated in the notification, and achieved
    by requesting UEs, belonging to the same MBMS service group, to
    respond to counting by sending MBMS COUNTING RESPONSE signalling
    flow to CRNC.

> a\. For UEs in idle mode the counting response refers to the RRC
> connection establishment procedure.
>
> b\. For UEs in URA\_PCH, or CELL\_PCH state the counting response
> refers to cell update procedure

c For UEs in CELL\_FACH state the counting response refers to signalling
on CCCH or DCCH.

2.  The exact number of UEs that need to respond to counting is an RRM
    issue.

3.  Since it is desirable in a specific cell, to avoid bringing a large
    number of UEs for counting purposes to RRC connected mode at the
    same time (RACH load, etc), RRM may control the load due to the RRC
    connection establishment requests, by setting an access
    \"probability factor\". For UEs in PMM connected mode the UTRAN may
    set different \"probability factor\" than for UEs in idle mode.

4.  Following counting, the number of subscribers that need to be
    maintained in RRC connected mode or for which the RNC releases their
    connection, is also an RRM issue. In Broadcast Mode, the RNC may
    also decide to reject the RRC connection establishment and indicate
    during this reject that counting has been completed.

5.  For a given MBMS service, the counting indication in the
    notification may be switched on and off, on per-cell basis.

6.  The RNC may use notification to indicate counting during an ongoing
    MBMS session (term used is re-counting).

7.  The RNC receives via Iu from CN information (MBMS service ID) about
    UEs who are in RRC Connected mode, and have joined the MBMS service.
    This information may be used for counting purposes.

The MBMS counting function includes a mechanism by which the UTRAN can
prompt UEs with a given activated service to become RRC connected. This
procedure is only applicable for UEs in idle mode and relies on the MBMS
ACCESS INFORMATION transmitted on the MCCH. The probability factor
indicates the probability with which UEs need to attempt an RRC
connection procedure.

In order to trigger counting for a given service, the UTRAN may use the
regular MBMS notification mechanism outlined in section 5.2.4 to force
UEs with that service activated to read the MCCH information.

Once a UE detects that the counting procedure is on-going for the
specific service it wants to receive, it will attempt to respond to the
counting based on the probability factor included in the MCCH. If the
response to counting is for a service identified in the list of MBMS
Selected Services, the UE should provide the MBMS Service ID in the
response.

Also, the UE will keep receiving the MBMS ACCESS INFORMATION at every
access info period until the UE successfully responds to the counting or
counting is no longer required. Whenever it receives new MBMS ACCESS
INFORMATION the UE will update its probability factor with the new
value.

The Figure 5.2.5 below illustrates this mechanism. The green colour for
the MICH indicates when the NI is set for the service. The green colour
for the MBMS ACCESS INFORMATION indicates that the counting procedure is
on-going and that UEs need to establish an RRC connection based on the
included probability factor (PF). For the critical MCCH info, different
colours indicate potentially different content.

Figure 5.2.5: Illustration of Access Info period during MBMS counting

For every UE brought to RRC connected state for the purpose of counting,
UTRAN will initiate the PMM Connection establishment procedure and will
obtain from CN the set of MBMS services these users have joined.

Counting for on-going services (re-counting) will rely on the same
scheduling of the MCCH information.

### 5.2.6 MBMS Radio Bearer Release in the UE

The UE releases the MBMS RB by using one of the following mechanisms:

\- Explicit MBMS RB Release

\- Implicit MBMS RB Release

The Explicit MBMS RB Release mechanism allows UTRAN to explicitly
indicate to MBMS UEs that an MBMS Radio Bearer should be released. For
p-t-m transmissions the Explicit MBMS RB Release indication is contained
within the MBMS SERVICE INFORMATION signalling flow. For p-t-p
transmission the release of MBMS radio bearers is completed in the same
way as for a non-MBMS radio bearer. If the Explicit MBMS RB Release
indication is received, the UE releases the MBMS RB.

The Implicit MBMS RB Release mechanism applies only to p-t-m
transmission and enables a UE to release the MBMS Radio Bearer without
receiving the Explicit MBMS RB Release. The UE identifies Implicit MBMS
RB release if it detects that the RB is not present in the MBMS SERVICE
INFORMATION signalling flow.

### 5.2.7 MBMS Session Repetition

In the case that the BM-SC repeats MBMS sessions (send multiple time
identical content), the MBMS service Id and MBMS session Id is used to
identify specific MBMS service and session. The validity of the session
Id is handled on the MBMS application layer between the BM-SC and the
UE. If UTRAN receives the MBMS session ID in session start, the UTRAN
should:

-   include MBMS session Id in critical and non critical information
    send on MCCH\
    Note: The non-critical information may contain index referring to
    critical information, avoiding repetition of MBMS service and
    session Id in non-critical information.

If the UE has already received correctly the data of the MBMS session,
which is being indicated on MCCH, the UE may:

-   ignore FLC by not applying the Layer Convergence Information

-   ignore counting procedure in Idle, URA\_PCH, CELL\_PCH, and
    CELL\_FACH state

-   ignore p-t-m MBMS RB setup signalled on MCCH

-   ignore p-t-p MBMS RB indication signalled on MCCH

-   reject the p-t-p RB setup for MBMS service, signalled on DCCH

In the case that UTRAN receives reject from the UE to the p-t-p RB setup
for MBMS service on DCCH, the UTRAN should not try to re-establish p-t-p
RB setup for that MBMS service and session.

In the case that the UE has accepted the p-t-p RB for repeated MBMS
session the UE shall receive the complete session.

### 5.2.8 MBMS Service Prioritisation

The CN may assign the Allocation and Retention Priority for the MBMS
bearer service. The Allocation and Retention Priority allows for
prioritisation between MBMS bearer services and between MBMS bearer
services and non MBMS bearer services in the UTRAN.

The UE may assign internally different priorities for different MBMS
services to prioritise MBMS and non MBMS service reception. In case that
UE has no capability to receive simultaneously, the dedicated non MBMS
service and the MBMS service and the MBMS service has priority over the
non MBMS service the UE may:

-   initialise signalling with CN on NAS layer to stop reception of
    dedicated non MBMS service

If the UE has no capacity on receiving all MBMS services, which it has
activated and which are transmitted simultaneously on p-t-m RBs, the UE
may

-   stop autonomously ongoing reception of lower priority MBMS service

-   act on MCCH message assigned to the highest priority MBMS service

-   start autonomously the reception p-t-m RB of the highest priority
    MBMS service

If the reception p-t-p RB of the lower priority MBMS service is blocking
the reception of p-t-m RB of the higher priority MBMS service the UE
may:

> If p-t-p RB is being established

-   reject the setup of p-t-p MBMS RB

> If the UTRAN receives reject message UTRAN should not try to
> re-establish p-t-p RB setup for that MBMS service and session.

If p-t-p RB is already existing

-   request the release of p-t-p MBMS RB from the UTRAN or only indicate
    frequency of higher priority MBMS service

If the UTRAN receives release request message UTRAN may release the
p-t-p MBMS RB.

5.3 Protocol structure
----------------------

### 5.3.1 MBMS User Plane Protocol Stack Architecture

Figure 5.3.1-1: Protocol Stack for MTCH

Figure 5.3.1-1 illustrates the protocol termination for MTCH in MBMS,
which is used in p-t-m transmission.

If configured by CRNC the PDCP sub-layer performs header
compression/decompression for the MBMS traffic.

The PDCP sub-layer may operate with the RFC 3095 header compression
protocol. In that case, header compression should be performed under RFC
3095 U-mode.

In the UTRAN, for p-t-m transmission, there is one PDCP entity for each
MBMS service for each MBMS Cell Group that provides the service (an MBMS
Cell Group may contain one or more than one cell).

In the UTRAN, for p-t-m transmission, there is one RLC entity for each
MBMS service in each cell or cell group in case of utilization of
selective combining or maximum ratio combining in TDD, and one MAC
entity for each cell.

In the UE side, there is one PDCP and RLC entity for each MBMS service
in each UE. In each UE there is one MAC entity per received cell when UE
is performing the selective combining between these cells.

In case of p-t-p transmission, DTCH is used for MBMS transmission and
the protocol termination for DTCH mapped on DCH and RACH/FACH are
presented in \[8\].

Figure 5.3.1-2: Protocol Stack for MTCH (P-T-M) in case of IP multicast
distribution

Figure 5.3.1-2 illustrates the protocol termination for MTCH in MBMS,
which is used in p-t-m transmission in case of IP Multicast
distribution.

Based on the configuration in BM-SC the PDCP sub-layer may perform
header compression/decompression for the MBMS traffic.

The PDCP sub-layer may operate with the RFC 3095 header compression
protocol. In that case, header compression should be performed under RFC
3095 U-mode.

In the UTRAN, for p-t-m transmission, there is one PDCP entity for each
MBMS service for each MBMS IP Multicast Group that provides the service
(an MBMS IP Multicast Group may contain one or more than one RNC, see
section 5.2.2).

For p-t-m transmission there is one RLC entity for each MBMS service in
each cell or in a group of multiple cells belonging to one RNS. The RLC
entities, in the RNSs synchronized to each other, shall process the user
data similar manner with the help of information delivered by the
SYNC-protocol to RNS. There is one MAC entity for each cell.

In the UE side, there is one PDCP and RLC entity for each MBMS service
in each UE. In each UE there is one MAC entity per received cell when UE
is performing the selective combining between these cells.

In case of p-t-p transmission, DTCH is used for MBMS transmission and
the protocol termination for DTCH mapped on DCH and RACH/FACH are
presented in \[8\].

### 5.3.2 MBMS Control Plane Protocol Stack Architecture

Figure 5.3.2-1: Protocol Stack for MCCH and MSCH

Figure 5.3.2-1 illustrates the protocol termination for MCCH and MSCH in
MBMS, which are MBMS p-t-m control channels.

MBMS functionalities are included in MAC and RRC.

In case of p-t-p transmission, DCCH is used for MBMS and the protocol
termination for DCCH mapped on DCH and FACH are presented in \[8\].

Figure 5.3.2-2: Protocol Stack for MCCH

In case MRNC is used, figure 5.3.2-2 illustrates the protocol
termination for MCCH in MBMS, which is MBMS p-t-m control channel.

MBSFN MCCH Information Control function is split between MRNC and CRNC.
The MRNC controls the logical resources of the RNSs that are used for
MBSFN operation within the MBSFN cluster(s). The MRNC informs the CRNC
of the MCCH configuration (using transfer of MCCH Information Control
messages) and schedule information to be used (included in RNSAP). The
CRNC performs the MCCH configuration and sends the MCCH information
accordingly.

5.4 MAC architecture
--------------------

### 5.4.1 UTRAN MAC Architecture to support MBMS

Figure 5.4.1: UTRAN MAC architecture

To support MBMS user and control plane transmission, a multicast
functionality is added in the MAC c/sh, entitled \"MAC m\", to take care
of scheduling of MBMS related transport channels as presented in Figure
5.4.1. In addition, three logical channels are considered for p-t-m
transmission of MBMS: MCCH, MSCH and MTCH. These logical channels are
mapped on FACH. In case of p-t-p transmission DTCH and DCCH are used.

### 5.4.2 MAC-c/sh/m architecture: UTRAN side

Figure 5.4.2 illustrates the MAC-m additions to the MAC-c/sh
architecture in the UTRAN side, needed to transmit MBMS data over a
common transport channel (FACH).

MAC-c/sh/m is located in the controlling RNC. The following
functionalities are covered:

-   Scheduling / Buffering / Priority Handling: This function manages
    common transport resources between MBMS and non-MBMS data flow(s)
    according to their priority and delay requirements set by higher
    layers.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   TCTF MUX: This function handles insertion of the TCTF field in the
    MAC header and also the respective mapping between logical channels
    (i.e. MTCH and MCCH) and transport channels. The TCTF field
    indicates which type of logical channel (i.e. MTCH and MCCH) is
    used.

-   Addition of MBMS-ID: For p-t-m type of logical channels, the MBMS-ID
    field in the MAC header is used to distinguish between MBMS
    services.

-   TFC selection: Transport format combination selection is done for a
    common transport channel (FACH) mapped to MTCH, MSCH and MCCH. In
    the case of MBMS soft combining (excluding TrCH combining in TDD),
    the combinable S-CCPCHs shall have the same TFC during the TTIs in
    which L1 combining is used.

There is one MAC-c/sh/m entity in the UTRAN for each cell.

Figure 5.4.2: UTRAN side MAC-m architecture additions to MAC-c/sh

### 5.4.3 MAC-c/sh/m architecture: UE side

Figure 5.4.3 illustrates the MAC-m additions to the MAC-c/sh
architecture in the UE side, needed to receive MBMS data over a
transport channel (FACH).

The following functionalities are covered:

-   TCTF DEMUX: This function handles detection and deletion of the TCTF
    field in the MAC header, and also the respective mapping between
    logical channels (i.e. MTCH and MCCH) and transport channels. The
    TCTF field indicates which type of logical channel (i.e. MTCH and
    MCCH) is used.

-   Reading of MBMS-ID: The MBMS-ID identifies data to a specific MBMS
    service.

There is one MAC-m entity in the UE or in case of selective combining
one MAC-m entity for each selectively combined cell in the UE.

6 MBMS Channel Structure 
========================

There exists two transmission modes to provide the MBMS service:

-   Point-to-point transmission (p-t-p)

-   Point-to-multipoint transmission (p-t-m)

6.1 Point-to-Point Transmission
-------------------------------

Point-to-point transmission is used to transfer MBMS specific
control/user plane information as well as dedicated control/user plane
information between the network and one UE in RRC Connected Mode. It is
used only for the multicast mode of MBMS and for services identified in
the list of MBMS Selected Services.

For a UE in CELL\_FACH and Cell\_DCH, DCCH or DTCH is used, allowing all
existing mappings to transport channels.

A detailed description of channels used for point-to-point transmission
is given in \[8\].

6.2 Point-to-multipoint Transmission
------------------------------------

Point-to-multipoint transmission is used to transfer MBMS specific
control/user plane information between the network and several UEs in
RRC Connected or Idle Mode. It is used for broadcast or multicast mode
of MBMS.

### 6.2.1 Logical Channels

#### 6.2.1.1 MBMS point-to-multipoint Control Channel (MCCH)

This logical channel is used for a p-t-m downlink transmission of
control plane information between network and UEs in RRC Connected or
Idle Mode. The control plane information on MCCH is MBMS specific and is
sent to UEs in a cell with an activated (joined) MBMS service. MCCH can
be sent in S-CCPCH carrying the DCCH of the UEs in CELL\_FACH state, or
in standalone S-CCPCH, or in same S-CCPCH with MTCH. For 3.84 Mcps TDD
MBSFN IMB, MCCH is sent in a standalone S-CCPCH frame type 1 only.

The MCCH is always mapped to one specific FACH in the S-CCPCH as
indicated on the BCCH. If MCCH is the only logical channel mapped in to
the FACH, the absence of the TCTF field is explicitly signalled
otherwise the TCTF field is used in MAC header to identify MCCH logical
channel type. In case of soft combining, the MCCH is mapped to a
different S-CCPCH (CCTrCH in TDD) than MTCH.

Reception of paging has priority over reception of MCCH for Idle mode
and URA/CELL\_PCH UEs.

#### 6.2.1.2 MBMS point-to-multipoint Traffic Channel (MTCH)

This logical channel is used for a p-t-m downlink transmission of user
plane information between network and UEs in RRC Connected or Idle Mode.
The user plane information on MTCH is MBMS Service specific and is sent
to UEs in a cell with an activated MBMS service.

The MTCH is always mapped to one specific FACH in the S-CCPCH, or in the
S-CCPCH frame type 2 in case of 3.84 Mcps TDD MBSFN IMB, as indicated on
the MCCH. The TCTF field is always used in MAC header to identify MTCH
logical channel type.

#### 6.2.1.3 MBMS point-to-multipoint Scheduling Channel (MSCH)

This logical channel is used for a p-t-m downlink transmission of MBMS
service transmission schedule between network and UEs in RRC Connected
or Idle Mode. The control plane information on MSCH is MBMS service and
S-CCPCH specific and is sent to UEs in a cell receiving MTCH. One MSCH
is sent in each S-CCPCH carrying the MTCH.

The MSCH is always mapped to one specific FACH in the S-CCPCH as
indicated on the MCCH. Due to different error requirements the MSCH is
mapped to a different FACH than MTCH. If MSCH is the only logical
channel mapped in to the FACH, the absence of the TCTF field is
explicitly signalled otherwise the TCTF field is used in MAC header to
identify MSCH logical channel type.

### 6.2.2 Transport Channel

FACH is used as a transport channel for MTCH, MSCH and MCCH.

### 6.2.3 Physical Channel

SCCPCH is used as a physical channel for FACH carrying MTCH or MCCH or
MSCH.

### 6.2.4 Mapping between channels

Only in downlink, the following connections between logical channels and
transport channels exist:

\- MCCH can be mapped to FACH

\- MTCH can be mapped to FACH

\- MSCH can be mapped to FACH

The mappings as seen from the UE and UTRAN sides are shown in Figure
6.2.4-1 and Figure 6.2.4-2 respectively.

Figure 6.2.4-1: Logical channels mapped onto transport channel, seen
from the UE side

Figure 6.2.4-2: Logical channels mapped onto transport channel, seen
from the UTRAN side

### 6.2.5 Data Flows through Layer 2

#### 6.2.5.1 Data flow for MCCH mapped to FACH

For MCCH, the RLC mode to be employed is UM-RLC, with required
enhancements to support out of sequence SDU delivery. A MAC header is
used for logical channel type identification.

#### 6.2.5.2 Data flow for MTCH mapped to FACH

For MTCH, the RLC mode to be employed is UM-RLC, with required
enhancements to support selective combining. Quick repeat may be used in
RLC-UM. A MAC header is used for logical channel type identification and
MBMS service identification. For MBMS in case of inter-RNC MBSFN and
soft combining, MAC PDUs to be transmitted in one TTI shall be ordered
according to MBMS-ID when multiple MTCHs are multiplexed onto one FACH.

#### 6.2.5.3 Data flow for MSCH mapped to FACH

For MSCH, the RLC mode to be employed is UM-RLC. A MAC header is used
for logical channel type identification.

6.3. MBMS Notification Indicator Channel 
----------------------------------------

MBMS notification utilizes a new MBMS specific PICH called the MBMS
Notification Indicator Channel (MICH) in each cell. Its coding is
defined in \[9\] (FDD) and \[10\] (TDD).

7 MBMS Reception and UE Capability
==================================

7.1 Selective and Soft Combining for MBMS P-T-M transmission
------------------------------------------------------------

The selective combining for MBMS p-t-m transmission is supported by RLC
PDU numbering. Therefore, the selective combining in the UE is possible
from cells providing similar MBMS RB bit rate, provided that the
de-synchronization between MBMS p-t-m transmission streams does not
exceed the RLC re-ordering capability of the UE. Thus, there exist one
RLC entity in the UE side.

To support selective combining it is decided to:

\- Introduce re-ordering as a configurable feature of RLC-UM, within the
RLC specification.

\- Use the same mechanism as what is specified for MAC-hs (single T1
timer).

For selective combining there exist one RLC entity per MBMS service
utilizing p-t-m transmission in the cell group of the CRNC. All cells in
the cell group are under the same CRNC, i.e. Iur support is not
considered.

For soft combining to be possible, the relative delay between the radio
links to be combined, when they are received by the UE, must be no more
than (1 TTI)+(1 slot).

The UE capability requirements to support selective and soft combining
are defined in chapter 7.2. In case de-synchronization occurs between
MBMS transmissions in neighbouring cells belonging to an MBMS cell group
the CRNC may perform re-synchronization actions enabling UEs to perform
the selective combining between these cells.

For TDD, selection combining and soft combining can be used when Node-Bs
are synchronised. For FDD soft combining can be used when Node-Bs are
synchronized inside UE's soft combining reception window, and the data
fields of the soft combined S-CCPCHs are identical during soft combining
moments.

When selective or soft combining is available between cells the UTRAN
should send MBMS NEIGHBOURING CELL INFORMATION containing the MTCH
configuration of the neighbouring cells, available for selective or soft
combining. When partial soft combining is applied the MBMS NEIGHBOURING
CELL INFORMATION contains the L1-combining schedule, which indicates the
time moments when the UE may soft combine the S-CCPCH transmitted in
neighbouring cells with the S-CCPCH transmitted in the serving cell.
With MBMS NEIGHBOURING CELL INFORMATION the UE is able to receive MTCH
transmission from neighbouring cell without reception of the MCCH of
that cell.

The UE determines the neighbouring cell suitable for selective or soft
combining based on threshold (e.g. measured CPICH Ec/No) and the
presence of MBMS NEIGHBOURING CELL INFORMATION of that neighbour cell.

The possibility of performing selective or soft combining should be
signalled to the UE.

### 7.1.bis Simulcast Combining (TDD only)

In contrast to FDD, downlink macro diversity has not been a
characteristic of TDD during release \'99/4/5. As such TDD receivers are
not typically designed to facilitate the simultaneous reception of
multiple radio links and the incorporation of such a requirement for
MBMS in TDD would have non-trivial impacts on the receiver design.

Much of the receiver complexity increase associated with the combining
of multiple radio links in the UE can however be avoided in TDD by
combining macro-diversity with timeslot re-use. This also allows for the
throughput gains from timeslot re-use to be combined with further gains
from macro diversity.

In such a scheme, the transmissions of the same information from the
multiple participating cells are arranged such that they arrive at the
UE on substantially different timeslots, thereby removing the
requirement at the UE to detect multiple cells in the same timeslot.

As such, cells are partitioned into transmission \"groups\" or \"sets\".
Each transmission set is allocated a timeslot (or set of timeslots) for
MBMS transmission. The assigned slots are typically exclusively used by
that MBMS set; sets do not transmit when another set is active. The UE
attempts to receive information from each set and to combine them either
at the physical layer or RLC layer in order to enhance reception
reliability.

Figure 7.1.bis shows such a scheme applied to a tri-sectored deployment
model. 3 timeslots (t~1~, t~2~ and t~3~) are allocated to each sector
for the purposes of MBMS transmission. Each sector is assigned to a
particular \"MBMS transmission set\", set 1, 2 or 3.

An MBMS data unit or transport block is encoded over several radio
frames (eg: 80ms TTI). The physical channel bits that result are
effectively transmitted three times; once by MBMS set 1 in timeslot
t~1~, once by MBMS set 2 in timeslot t~2~, and once by MBMS set 3 in
timeslot t~3~.

Figure 7.1.bis: Example of non-time-coincident macro diversity
transmission

A given UE may be configured to listen to the separate transmissions of
the MBMS physical channels (one from each set) which, over the course of
the TTI, correspond to the MBMS transport block(s). The signals from
each MBMS set are largely non-time-coincident and do not require the use
of an extensively modified receiver architecture --a receiver
architecture resembling that of a normal \"single-radio-link\" TDD
receiver may be used.

The received transport blocks may be provided to the RLC layer for
selective combining, or soft information may be buffered and combined
across MBMS sets during the course of the TTI via physical layer soft
combining .

The UTRAN shall signal to the UE on the MCCH which services may be soft
combined (and in which cells). The cell group for soft combining may be
different than the cell group for selective combining. The UE may assume
that transmissions of a given service that may soft combined take place
in the same frame.

### 7.1.ter Chip Combining (1.28Mcps TDD)

Chip Combining is a technique that bears some relation to Space Code
Transmit Diversity (SCTD) in existing releases except that the combining
is performed between cells with different scrambling codes instead of
between transmit antennas of the same cell with the same scrambling
code.

Chip Combining has been proposed as another form of combining method for
p-t-m transmissions for 1.28Mcps TDD mode. All involved cells still keep
their own configuration of scrambling code (i.e. different cells
participating in the p-t-m transmission have different scrambling codes
on the MBMS timeslots). As for SFN transmission, in Chip Combining mode,
all Node Bs involved are closely time synchronized, which is an inherent
characteristic of TDD systems.

The UE interested in one p-t-m MBMS service gets the active
configuration, such as the midamble codes and the scrambling codes used
in the current cell and in the involved neighbouring cells from BCCH
and/or MCCH. The UE must monitor the signal strengths of the involved
cells and must select a number of cells to combine. In an active p-t-m
timeslot, the UE performs channel estimation of each cell to be combined
and gets the system matrixes of each involved cell respectively, and
then, one compound system matrix can be formed by combining the system
matrix of these involved cells. After that, the UE uses joint detection
algorithm to recover the MBMS data with the compound system matrix.

Chip Combining brings no change and requirement to network equipment.
However, in order to approach the performance offered by SFN, a
relatively large number of cells must be detected and efficiently
combined by the UE. Alternatively, chip combining could be used for
small service areas (only a small number of cells participate in a
simulcast transmission). In this case the number of cells which must be
combined by the UE can be reduced and the performance loss compared to
SFN is then lowered.

A UE should have a minimum capability to detect and combine a certain
number of cells so that performance of the MBMS p-t-m (and hence
coverage of the MBMS service) can be guaranteed. The complexity of the
UE and the performance of the chip combining method would have some
bearing on the choice of this minimum number of cells that must be
combined by the UE.

7.1A MBMS over a Single Frequency Network (MBSFN)
-------------------------------------------------

Another form of combining is possible for p-t-m transmissions and is
realised via utilisation of the same scrambling code at a given moment
in time by a group of cells covering a geographic area and is applicable
for FDD and for TDD. This form of combining is referred to as MBMS over
a Single Frequency Network (MBSFN). Signals from multiple cells may be
combined by the UE in the same manner as used for multipath signal
components from a single cell.

**The UE reception of MBMS services provided in MBSFN mode shall not
affect the UE behaviour on the unicast carrier. Especially the UE
mobility on the unicast carrier is not affected by the reception of MBMS
services provided on a cell operating in MBSFN mode and can imply that
the reception of the MBMS service on the cell operating in MBSFN mode is
impossible due to the limited support of combination of frequency bands
for MBMS SFN reception and unicast reception.**

MBSFN requires all Node Bs involved in the simulcast transmission to be
closely time synchronised and exactly the same content is delivered to
each of the involved Node Bs. All involved Node Bs are assumed to share
the same CRNC (the MBSFN area is limited to the area controlled by a
single RNC).

For TDD, some or all timeslots may utilise an MBSFN mode of
transmission. Such timeslots are configured by the RNC to use the same
scrambling codes across participating Node-Bs. Any non-MBSFN timeslots
continue to use the scrambling codes associated with the cell ID. The
timeslots that are operating in the MBSFN mode form together with the
synchronized neighbouring cells transmitting the exactly same data the
over the MBSFN cluster.

For FDD, Node-Bs participating in an MBSFN transmission do so on all
slots of the radio frame. Thus, MBSFN transmission occupies an entire
carrier in the case of FDD, whereas for TDD, part or all of the carrier
may be used for MBSFN.

In addition, MBSFN Integrated Mobile Broadcast (3.84 Mcps TDD MBSFN IMB)
is defined. In this configuration, the downlink physical channels for
the MBSFN option are mapped on a 3.84 Mcps TDD carrier frequency \[10\].
RF channel spacing according to the 3.84 Mcps TDD option is used. The
entire carrier is used downlink for the 3.84 Mcps TDD MBSFN IMB
transmission. For the Node B, the transmitter RF requirements defined
for the 3.84 Mcps TDD carriers apply. For the UE, the receiver RF
requirements defined for the 3.84 Mcps TDD carriers apply. A primary
synchronisation code shall be used, which is orthogonal to the primary
synchronisation code used in normal 3.84 Mcps TDD configurations. Unless
specified otherwise, the RRC and the MAC protocols are operated
according to the FDD requirements applicable for MBSFN.

**It shall be possible for UEs supporting MBSFN to receive MBMS via
carriers operating in FDD or TDD MBSFN mode and to also obtain unicast
and MBMS (those not provided via MBSFN) by another carrier.**

Allied to MBSFN is the use of higher order modulation techniques (16QAM)
for S-CCPCH and in the case of 3.84/7.68 Mcps TDD only the use of a new
burst type to support longer delay spread. In case of 3.84 Mcps TDD
MBSFN IMB, there are two types of S-CCPCHs: S-CCPCH frame type1 and
S-CCPCH frame type2. S-CCPCH frame type 1 consists of 15 slots per radio
frame and uses a channelisation code of spreading factor 256. FACH
carrying MCCH is mapped onto S-CCPCH type 1. S-CCPCH frame type 2 uses
channelisation codes of spreading factor 16 and consists of 5 sub-frames
per radio frame; each sub-frame consisting of 3 slots. S-CCPCH frame
type 2 is used to support short duty cycles on MTCH. The FACH carrying
MTCH may be mapped onto one or more codes of spreading factor 16.

Reception of MBMS services over a network operating in MBSFN mode
implies that the UE is registered to a PLMN in order to perform higher
layer procedures such as subscription to MBMS broadcast services. The
means by which a UE obtains details of services provided, subscribes to
those services it is interested in and obtains any ciphering keys
necessary to decrypt services and/or means by which the services are
delivered (MBSFN mode, frequency band used etc.), is considered to be
outside the scope of 3GPP specifications. However, it is envisaged that
the UE may obtain service details via a point-to-point connection via
the carrier that is used to provide unicast services.

The UE selects a MBSFN cluster to receive MBMS service that is part of
one of the registered PLMN or part of the equivalent PLMN list. (Note:
Network sharing is supported on carriers operating in MBSFN mode using
the possibility to broadcast multiple PLMNs in the MIB just as it
supported on carriers supporting unicast services)

For the MBSFN cluster in 1.28 Mcps TDD mode, the UE that needs receive
MBMS services delivered in an MBSFN cluster may first get synchronized
to the non MBSFN cell that the MBSFN cluster is associated with and then
search the MBSFN cluster with the information indicated in the system
information of the non MBSFN cell. From the UE's perspective, the
registered PLMN of the MBSFN cluster should be the same as the PLMN that
is registered by the UE from the associated unicast carrier.

A MBSFN cluster provides only MBMS service in PtM mode. Counting and PtP
establishment procedures are not supported for a cell operating in MBSFN
mode.

For FDD, 3.84 Mcps TDD IMB and 3.84/7.68 Mcps TDD, the selection between
MBSFN clusters is performed similarly to the way that cell selection is
performed for cells that are not operating in MBSFN mode. The UE shall
meet the minimum performance requirements specified for the reception of
a MBMS cluster. The UE may consider a minimum receive power of the CPICH
(FDD and 3.84 Mcps TDD IMB) or P-CCPCH (3.84/7.68 Mcps TDD) in order to
determine when to receive MBMS service broadcast in MBSFN mode. However
apart from background search procedures for receiving other MBSFN
clusters the UE is not required to perform inter-frequency measurements
for other MBSFN clusters. Hierarchical cell structure, rules for fast
moving UEs and inter-frequency and inter RAT measurements are not
applicable for the cell operating in MBSFN mode. The intra frequency
measurements for the reselection between MBSFN clusters are not
specified.

In a MBSFN cluster only MIB, system information blocks 3, 5/5bis and 11
may be broadcast. The content of other system information blocks is
ignored by the UE.

A MBSFN cluster on one frequency might indicate the existence and the
services provided by other MBSFN clusters on different frequencies. The
MBSFN cluster on one frequency may also indicate other MBSFN frequencies
that have to be selected in order for the UE to be aware of available
services that are not provided via the currently selected MBSFN cluster
and for which the availability can not be indicated on the current MBSFN
cluster. The choice of the MBSFN frequency based on this information is
UE implementation specific. Because inter frequency measurements for
MBSFN frequencies are not applicable the choice of the MBSFN frequency
done by the UE may be completely service dependant. For FDD, 3.84 Mcps
TDD IMB and 3.84/7.68 Mcps TDD the UE only has to discover one MBMS
cluster on another frequency that fulfils the selection criteria. Other
frequencies on which MBMS service is broadcast in MBSFN mode is
indicated on the MBSFN frequency.

A cluster operating in MBSFN mode does not provide paging information
because the MBSFN cluster will not be considered as a suitable cell by
the UE.

The cells in a MBSFN cluster belong to different MBMS service areas
compared to the cells of a carrier providing unicast service. This
allows the RNC to know which services are intended for the transmission
on the cells of a MBSFN cluster. The same MBMS bearer service is not
provided on a MBSFN cluster and the unicast cells.

The minimum MBMS service area must be equal to one MBSFN cluster. A MBMS
bearer service must be transmitted in a complete MBSFN cluster.

### 7.1A.1 3.84 / 7.68 MCPS TDD MBMS over a Single Frequency Network (MBSFN)

A TDD UE operating on a carrier not dedicated to MBSFN shall follow MBMS
procedures specified with respect to the RRC states (see Section 10).
For TDD carriers not dedicated to MBSFN, MBMS services may be delivered
via MBSFN and/or non-MBSFN means. In the case that any non-MBSFN
transmissions are used to deliver MBMS services, the MCCH should not be
transmitted via MBSFN means.

The reception of MBMS on a cell operating in MBSFN mode is independent
to the UE behaviour for the reception of service on the frequency that
the UE is camping on for obtaining unicast or MBMS service. For the
reception of MBMS service on a TDD cell dedicated to MBSFN operation the
UE is conceptually an independent component which receives MBMS service
on a TDD cell dedicated to MBSFN.

The TDD component of a UE for receiving MBMS service on a TDD carrier
dedicated to downlink MBSFN shall:

-   receive services provided via MBSFN independently of RRC state
    transitions for any non-MBSFN component of the UE

-   obtain details concerning the MCCH provided via the BCCH of the cell
    providing MBSFN and listen to that MCCH for details of MBMS services
    provided p-t-m on the TDD DL-only carrier

-   search for a suitable TDD MBSFN cluster providing the MBMS services
    that it is interested in:

    -   is only required to support BCH and FACH transport channels and
        physical channels P-CCPCH, S-CCPCH, SCH on the TDD carrier

    -   may optionally support MICH on the TDD carrier

    -   shall expect to receive S-CCPCH configuration information via
        System Information Block 5 (the UE shall expect to receive
        System Information blocks 3, 5 and 11 only in addition to the
        Master Information Block) via the BCH on the TDD carrier.

### 7.1A.2 FDD MBMS over a Single Frequency Network (MBSFN)

A FDD UE operating on a carrier not dedicated to MBSFN shall follow MBMS
procedures specified with respect to the RRC states (see Section 10).

The reception of MBMS on a cell operating in MBSFN mode is independent
to the UE behaviour for the reception of service on the frequency that
the UE is camping on for obtaining unicast or MBMS service. For the
reception of MBMS service on a FDD cell dedicated to MBSFN operation the
UE is conceptually an independent component which receives MBMS service
on a FDD cell dedicated to MBSFN.

The FDD component of a UE operating in a receive-only mode on a FDD
carrier operating in MBSFN mode shall:

-   receive services provided via MBSFN independently of RRC state
    transitions for any non-MBSFN component of the UE

-   obtain details concerning the MCCH provided via the BCCH of the cell
    providing MBSFN and listen to that MCCH for details of MBMS services
    provided p-t-m on the FDD DL-only carrier

-   search for a suitable FDD MBSFN cluster:

    -   is only required to support BCH and FACH transport channels and
        physical channels P-CCPCH, S-CCPCH and SCH on the FDD carrier

    -   may optionally support MICH on the FDD carrier

    -   shall expect to receive S-CCPCH configuration information via
        System Information Block 5 (the UE shall expect to receive
        System Information blocks 3, 5 and 11 only in addition to the
        Master Information Block) via the BCH on the FDD carrier.

### 7.1A.3 1.28 MCPS TDD MBMS over a Single Frequency Network (MBSFN)

A TDD UE operating on a carrier not dedicated to MBSFN shall follow MBMS
procedures specified with respect to the RRC states (see Section 10).
For TDD carriers not dedicated to MBSFN, MBMS services may be delivered
via MBSFN and/or non-MBSFN means.  In the case that any non-MBSFN
transmissions are used to deliver MBMS services, the MCCH should not be
transmitted via MBSFN means.

The reception of MBMS on a cell operating in MBSFN mode is independent
to the UE behaviour for the reception of service on the frequency that
the UE is camping on for obtaining unicast or MBMS service. For the
reception of MBMS service on a TDD cell dedicated to MBSFN operation the
UE is conceptually an independent component which receives MBMS service
on a TDD cell dedicated to MBSFN.

The TDD component of a UE for receiving MBMS service on a TDD carrier
dedicated to downlink MBSFN shall:

-   receive services provided via MBSFN independently of RRC state
    transitions for any non-MBSFN component of the UE

-   obtain details concerning the MCCH provided via the BCCH of the cell
    providing MBSFN and listen to that MCCH for details of MBMS services
    provided p-t-m on the TDD DL-only carrier

-   search for a suitable TDD MBSFN cluster providing the MBMS services
    that it is interested in:

    -   is only required to support BCH and FACH transport channels and
        physical channels P-CCPCH, S-CCPCH on the TDD carrier

    -   may optionally support MICH on the TDD carrier

    -   shall expect to receive S-CCPCH configuration information via
        System Information Block 5 (the UE shall expect to receive
        System Information blocks 3, 5 and 11 only in addition to the
        Master Information Block) via the BCH on the TDD carrier.

NOTE: For 1.28 Mcps TDD, if a cell is operating in MBSFN mode, system
information and MCCH messages are transmitted through the Special
Timeslot \[10\].

### 7.1A.4 3.84 Mcps TDD IMB MBMS over a Single Frequency Network (MBSFN)

A 3.84 Mcps TDD MBSFN IMB capable UE operating on an FDD or 3.84/7.68
Mcps TDD carrier not dedicated to MBSFN shall follow MBMS procedures
specified with respect to the RRC states (see Section 10).

The reception of MBMS on a cell operating in MBSFN mode is independent
to the UE behaviour for the reception of service on the frequency that
the UE is camping on for obtaining unicast or MBMS service. For the
reception of MBMS service on a cell dedicated to 3.84 Mcps TDD MBSFN IMB
operation, the UE is conceptually an independent component which
receives MBMS service on a cell dedicated to 3.84 Mcps TDD MBSFN IMB.

The 3.84 Mcps TDD MBSFN IMB component of a UE receiving MBMS service on
a 3.84 Mcps TDD carrier dedicated to 3.84 Mcps TDD MBSFN IMB shall:

\- receive services provided via MBSFN independently of RRC state
transitions for any non-MBSFN component of the UE;

\- obtain details concerning the MCCH provided via the BCCH of the cell
providing 3.84 Mcps TDD MBSFN IMB and listen to that MCCH for details of
MBMS services provided p-t-m on the 3.84 Mcps TDD carrier dedicated to
3.84 Mcps TDD MBSFN IMB;

\- search for a suitable MBSFN cluster providing the MBMS services the
UE has activated:

o is only required to support BCH and FACH transport channels and
physical channels P-CCPCH, S-CCPCH frame type 1, S-CCPCH frame type 2
and SCH on the 3.84 Mcps TDD carrier dedicated to 3.84 Mcps TDD MBSFN
IMB;

o may optionally support MICH on the 3.84 Mcps TDD carrier dedicated to
3.84 Mcps TDD MBSFN IMB;

o shall expect to receive S-CCPCH frame type 1 configuration information
via System Information Block 5 (the UE shall expect to receive System
Information blocks 3, 5 and 11 only in addition to the Master
Information Block) via the BCH on the 3.84 Mcps TDD carrier dedicated to
3.84 Mcps TDD MBSFN IMB.

7.1B MBMS in case of inter-RNC synchronization
----------------------------------------------

### 7.1B.1 Control Plane aspects

#### **7.1B.1.1** MBMS Parameter Configurations

The common parameters in MBMS P-t-M RB configurations shall be
configured in each RNC semi-static manner via O&M.

The parameters, transmitted in RRC: MBMS Common P-T-M RB Information and
to be configured, are:

\- RB Information list

\- RB identity

\- PDCP info

\- RLC info

\- TrCh information for each TrCH

\- Transport channel identity

\- TFS

\- TrCh information for each CCTrCh

\- CCTrCH identity

\- TFCS

In case of soft combining the Secondary CCPCH configurations shall be
aligned between the neighboring cells.

In case of MBSFN:

If MBMS services are controlled statically, the parameters to be
configured for MBSFN:

\- PhyCh information

\- PhyCh identity

\- Secondary CCPCH info MBMS

.In the case the used parameter value in a cell may depend on the
received RAB QoS and/or MBMS service area ID and/or TMGI value, the
mapping information should be configured via O&M. Such mapping
information should be available in RNCs before the MBMS session setup.

If MRNC is used, the parameters shall be configured by MRNC, and the
MRNC shall inform CRNC of the configuration and mapping information of
MBMS service to RB information at session start.

In addition to parameters used for air interface, the pool of DL TEIDs
used for the MBMS transmission on Iu carried by IP-multicast
distribution shall be configured in all RNCs by O&M. The stored DL TEIDs
used in IP multicast distribution shall not be used by the RNC for any
other transmission.

#### **7.1B.1.2** MBMS Counting and mode switch coordination 

The RNC shall generate the MBMS Counting procedure towards UEs as in
case of intra-RNC selective/soft combining (see section 5.2.5).

If the RNS controlled by a RNC is smaller than the possible selective /
soft combining area, the status of the cells in surrounding RNC that are
part of the selective/soft combining area should be known before
deciding on the own transmission mode. Therefore the RNC shall exchange
the transmission mode and counting information with the neighbouring
RNCs, which are controlling cells part of the same selective/soft
combining area as the cells controlled by the current RNC. Also the
neighbour cells indicated for selective/soft combining in MBMS
NEIGHBOURING CELL P-T-M RB INFORMATION message have to be coordinated
between RNCs.

The RNSAP function, *Information Exchange* is used for counting and mode
switch coordination.

The RNC may request for the counting results and transmission mode
information in cells controlled by a neighbour RNC by sending the
INFORMATION EXCHANGE INITIATION REQUEST message to the relevant
neighbouring RNCs.

For counting the INFORMATION EXCHANGE INITIATION REQUEST message will
contain the information about the cells controlled by the sending RNC,
for which the sending RNC have requested counting. The RNC receiving the
INFORMATION EXCHANGE INITIATION REQUEST message shall first identify if
any of the cells received in the message is announced as a neighbour
cell for the MBMS service in the cells controlled by the receiving RNC
(own cells). Thereafter the receiving RNC shall perform counting in
these own cells and inform sending RNC about the result over Iur in the
INFORMATION EXCHANGE INITIATION RESPONSE message.

For MBMS transmission mode change the INFORMATION EXCHANGE INITIATION
REQUEST message will contain information about the cells controlled by
the sending RNC (\"initiating cell list\") and the TMGIs for which the
MBMS transmission mode are requested to be reported when the
transmission mode is changed. The MBMS transmission mode shall be
reported for cells under control of the RNC receiving the INFORMATION
EXCHANGE INITIATION REQUEST message. The MBMS transmission mode for the
TMGIs in the INFORMATION EXCHANGE INITIATION REQUEST message shall be
reported for the cells that have a configured neighbour relation to the
cells in the \"initiating cell list\".

The RNC initiating the Information Exchange Initiation procedure shall
use the received MBMS transmission mode information of the neighbour
cells under control of another RNC to update MBMS NEIGHBOURING CELL
P\_T\_M RB INFORMATION message content of its own cells.

#### 7.1B.1.3 Control Plane Coordination at MBMS Session Start

##### 7.1B.1.3.1 Coordination of neighbor cell configuration

The RNC shall at MBMS session start in its own cells, being part of the
targeted MBMS service area, activate the RNSAP Information Exchange
Initiation procedure to all neighboring RNCs, which are controlling
cells allowed to be used for selective/soft combining with the relevant
own cells of the RNC. The response, INFORMATION EXCHANGE INITIATION
RESPONSE and INFORMATION REPORT messages shall contain the copy of the
RRC containers, which were sent out on MCCH announcing the active MBMS
session and for each MBMS session that is started a list of cell
identities in which the MBMS session (identified with TMGI) was setup.

The receiving RNC shall identify based on the received information the
valid neighbor cells for soft/selective combining in the RNC, which is
the sender of the message for the new MBMS session, and retrieve the
S-CCPCH configuration in those neighboring cells. Finally the MBMS
COMMON P-T-M RB INFORMATION shall be updated with the received S-CCPCH
configuration information and the neighboring cells are announced in
MBMS NEIGHBOURING CELL p-t-m rb Information.

As part of the "Valid neighbor cell identification" the RNC shall verify
that the configuration of the cells of the sending RNC is aligned and
possible for soft combining, e.g. that the MBMS logical channel id is
aligned for all MBMS sessions. The RNC shall not accept the cell as
neighbor cell if not aligned. The consequence of a mismatch is that the
soft/selective combining gain is lost for this MBMS session, but as this
abnormal condition only occurs rarely it is regarded as acceptable.

**Coordination of MBMS configurations after RNC restarts**

In case of restart the RNC may loose all the MBMS configurations of its
cells as well the neighbor cell MBMS information and any other MBMS
related parameters.

The RNC will recover from that situation by getting the MBMS
configurations updated in a three phase approach:

1\. via O&M the MBMS service configurations for its cells. In addition
to the MBMS service area configurations there are other parameters which
can be configured semi-static manner via O&M system like indicated
above.

2\. As part of the general restart procedure the SGSN will send the
Session Starts for all ongoing MBMS sessions to the RNC. RNC will
respond to the MBMS Session Start messages normal manner in line with
the MBMS service area configurations of its cells.

3\. After the RNC has become aware of the active MBMS sessions it will
identify the relevant neighboring RNCs which should be contacted to
retrieve the necessary parameters for the neighbor cell configuration.

#### 7.1B.1.4 MCCH synchronization in an MBSFN cluster

To synchronize MCCH dynamically, the logical entity \"MBMS Master RNC\"
may be introduced to control the resources of the RNSs within the MBSFN
cluster(s). There's only one MBMS Master RNC for any MBSFN cluster. The
other RNC can be seen as the CRNC.

If MRNC is used, the RNSAP procedure \"MBSFN MCCH Information\" is used
to transfer information between MRNC and CRNC to synchronize the MCCH.

### 7.1B.2 User Plane aspects

#### 7.1B.2.1 Timing requirements

The soft combining and MBSFN mode across RNCs will require similar
timing requirements between the cells controlled by different RNCs as
what is required for cells part of same RNC in Rel-6 and Rel-7. The
summary of the timing requirements is presented in the table below.

Table 7.1B.2.1-1 The table summarizes the timing requirements for WCDMA
MBMS

  ---------------------------------------------------- ------------------ --------------------
  Functionality                                        Release            Timing requirement
  MBMS 40 ms TTI                                       3GPP Release 6     40.667 ms
  MBMS 80 ms TTI                                       3GPP Release 6     80.667 ms
  MBMS with single frequency network support (MBSFN)   3GPP Release 7/8   12.8 microseconds
  ---------------------------------------------------- ------------------ --------------------

There are several ways to synchronize the network elements to a common
reference time: which meet Rel6/MBSFN timing requirements.

• 3GPP synchronization in UTRAN,

• Network Time Protocol (NTP),

• Relying on IP multicast distribution,

• Global positioning system (GPS),

• IEEE1588.

All the listed synchronisation methods may be used but the provided
accuracy could be dependent on the synchronisation deployment solution [
]{.underline}

#### 7.1B.2.2 MBMS User Data flow synchronization

The synchronized radio interface transmission from the cells controlled
by different RNCs require a SYNC-protocol support over the Iu-interface
between the BM-SC and the RNCs.

As part of the SYNC-protocol procedure the BM-SC shall include to the
SYNC PDU packets a time stamp which tells the timing based on which the
RNC sends MBMS data over air interface. This time stamp is based on a
common time reference available at the BM-SC and the RNCs and represents
a relative time value which refers to the start time of the
synchronisation period.

MBMS user data shall be time-stamped based on separable synchronization
sequences which are tied to multiples of the TTI length. Synchronization
sequence is transmitted continuously, even if there is no MBMS user data
in the synchronization sequence. Each synchronization sequence for each
service is denoted by a single timestamp value working in such a manner
that an increase of the timestamp value by one synchronisation sequence
length shall be interpreted as an implicit
start-of-a-new-synchronization-sequence-indicator, so that the RNC
becomes aware that a new sequence is starting. For additional
robustness, the timestamp shall be replicated to all packets that shall
be submitted over the air interface within one or multiple TTIs.

When adding the Time Stamp the BM-SC should take into account following
factors: arrival time of data, the Maximum Transmission Delay from BM-SC
to the farthermost RNC, the length of the synchronization sequence used
for time stamping and other extra delay (e.g. processing delay in RNC
and NodeB ). The parameters 'Max Tx Delay', 'synchronization sequence
length' and 'Other Extra Delay' are set via O&M in BM-SC.

The BM-SC does not know the absolute time point at which a TTI starts,
but the sequence length for the time stamp is set by O&M like the delay
parameters. The BM-SC will use the delay parameters to define the
transmission time point of that user data packet and for the following
user data packets the sequence length for the time stamp: following user
data packets arriving within e.g. 40ms will receive the same time stamp
value as the first data packet, if the sequence length is set to be 40
ms.

The RNC shall schedule the received data packets in the TTIs following
the time point indicated by the timestamp.

NOTE: From the timestamp the RNC can interpret the TTI from which the
transmission of the first user data packet with that time stamp value
shall start. Whether there will be data packets to be transmitted in the
following TTIs will depend on the used synchronization sequence length
vs. the TTI length and on the user data flow.

In case MRNC is used and TDM multiplexing is used over air interface,
scheduling transmission time interval is defined as a time interval of
the minimal common multiple of synchronization sequence length and TDM
period (CFN period shall be divided by TDM period) in the MRNC. The MRNC
shall inform the scheduling transmission time interval to the RNCs over
Iur together with MCCH message. The RNC shall schedule received data
packets in the scheduling transmission time interval following the time
point indicated by the timestamp. If multiple synchronization sequences
are to be transmitted consecutively in one scheduling transmission time
interval, these synchronization sequences shall be processed as if they
are a single synchronization sequence.

In case MRNC is not used and TDM is used over air interface, the
synchronization sequence length should be configured to be multiples of
the TDM Period (CFN period shall be a multiple of the TDM period).

The elementary procedures related to the SYNC-protocol are defined in
\[14\].

In addition to the Time Stamp parameter the BM-SC shall provide together
with each MBMS User data packet the \'*Packet Counter*\' and \'*Elapsed
Octet Counter*\' information. Based on these parameters the RNC is able
to notice if any data packets were lost during transmission via IP
Multicast and to know the size of the lost payload, in case of a single
packet is lost. Additionally the RNC is able to reorder the PDUs before
passing them to RLC processing, if needed.

At the end of each synchronization sequence the BM-SC shall send to the
RNCs at least one user data frame, which contains counter information
including \'*Total Number Of Packet Counter*\' and \'*Total Number Of
Octet*\' without MBMS payload. This *Total Counter* frame is implicitly
marking the end-of-sync.seq.. The *Total Counter* frame without payload
may be repeated in order to improve the reliability of the delivery to
the RNCs.

If neither Total Counter frame nor data Frame is received by a RNC for a
synchronization sequence, the RNC shall regard the whole synchronization
sequence data frame as lost.

#### 7.1B.2.3 User Plane recovery in case of Multiple Packets Loss

In case multiple contiguous SYNC PDUs are lost in the RNC, the division
of payload between the lost packets is not necessarily known by the RNC.
This may lead to an incorrect RLC SN value usage in the RNC, when
handling the first data packet received from BM-SC after the multiple
packet loss. The RNC is able to notice the loss of multiple user data
packets based on the *'Packet Counter'* information delivered by the
SYNC-protocol together with the user data packets. In such a situation
the radio interface transmission should be avoided until the RNC is able
to resynchronize its transport block creation with the neighbouring RNCs
or the radio interface transmission may be avoided for exact TTI(s)
impacted by the lost SYNC PDUs using the help of the length information
of the lost SYNC PDU provided by SYNC protocol.

In case of soft combining and MBSFN mode the RNC resynchronization is
supported by the RLC SN reset at the start of each synchronization
sequence in all RNCs part of the IP Multicast distribution. The RNCs are
able to notice the start of the synchronization sequence from the new
time stamp value and the packet counter information received from BM-SC.

In case MRNC is used and TDM multiplexing is used over air interface,
the RNC re-synchronization is supported by the RLC SN reset at the start
of each scheduling transmission time interval signalled from MRNC in all
RNCs part of the IP Multicast distribution.

In case of selective combining the RNC shall request from the
neighbouring RNCs, which are used for selective combining for that
particular MBMS stream, the correct RLC SN value to be used for the
first RLC PDU of the next synchronization sequence.

7.2 UE Capability
-----------------

The UE MBMS capability is not sent to UTRAN and is subject to UE
implementation, including the relation between MBMS capability and
actual RRC state which is also a UE implementation. A consequence is
that a UE may be counted although its actual capability does not allow
to receive MBMS transmissions e.g. because of its current RRC state.

The standard will describe a minimum UE capability requirement in order
to allow operators to configure MBMS channels that can be common to all
UEs supporting the given service.

There are some UE capability requirements that are common to all
eventual service categories:

The minimum UE capability for MBMS capable UE, is one primary CCPCH plus
all the configurations below. The UE is not required to support these
configurations simultaneously.

1.  One PICH and one MICH

2.  One S-CCPCH and one MICH

3.  One S-CCPCH (dedicated FACH and possibly the FACH, which may carry
    MCCH) and two S-CCPCH with 80ms TTI for MTCH reception

4.  One S-CCPCH (dedicated FACH and possibly the FACH, which may carry
    MCCH) and three S-CCPCH with 40ms TTI for MTCH reception

5.  One PICH and two S-CCPCH with 80ms TTI for MTCH reception

6.  One PICH and three S-CCPCH with 40ms TTI for MTCH reception

The requirement one reflects the case when the UE is in Idle mode, or
URA\_PCH, CELL\_PCH state and MBMS reception is not ongoing and
requirement five and six are for the case that MBMS reception is ongoing
in Idle mode, or URA\_PCH, CELL\_PCH state.

The requirement two reflects the case when the UE is in CELL\_FACH state
and MBMS is reception not ongoing and requirement three and four are for
the case when MBMS reception is ongoing respectively.

The requirement for the number of simultaneous S-CCPCHs for MTCH
reception includes those S-CCPCHs for which combining is performed.

When MBMS ptm reception is ongoing, the UE is required to periodically
monitor the MCCH, which may be mapped onto a different S-CCPCH from
MTCH, and a different S-CCPCH than the R'99 FACH when the UE is in
CELL\_FACH state. However this does not increase the requirement for the
number of S-CCPCHs to be simultaneously received by the UE.

The ability of the UE to receive DPCH/HS-PDSCH simultaneously with
S-CCPCH carrying MTCH/MCCH is subject to UE capability.

The minimum MBMS bit rate that all MBMS capable UEs shall support is to
be defined \[12\].

For FDD, the UE shall support selective combining and soft combining on
cells not indicating that they provide MBMS service in MBSFN mode.

For FDD and 3.84 Mcps TDD IMB, the UE is not required to support
selective combining and soft combining on cells indicating that they
provide MBMS service in MBSFN mode.

For a TDD UE supporting both transmit and receive functions, selective
and soft combining shall be supported. For a 3.84 / 7.68 Mcps TDD UE
supporting both transmit and receive functions, MBSFN operation shall
also be supported. For a UE supporting 3.84 / 7.68 Mcps TDD MBSFN
receive only, support for selective combining and soft combining is not
required.

The standard may restrict further the UE implementation options by
defining certain capability combinations.

If the UE is supporting MBMS ptm reception in CELL\_DCH state, it shall
have capability to acquire MCCH configuration from BCCH after handover
procedure, and after that receive MCCH and MTCH.

7.3 MBMS Reception
------------------

The following descriptions add MBMS specific processes to be considered
for each RRC State/Mode.

The BCCH contains information regarding the MCCH, while the latter
contains information on the MTCH.

In the sub-sections below, how and when the UE reads the MCCH is not
described as periodic MCCH transmission is described in section 5.2.3.

The reception of multiple MBMS services simultaneously is subject to UE
capability; selection principles between MBMS services are defined in
section 5.2.8. The specific actions related to MBMS session repetition
are specified in section 5.2.7.

### 7.3.1 MBMS Reception in RRC Idle Mode

In idle mode, the UE shall:

> \- if the UE supports MBMS and
>
> \- if the UE has activated an MBMS service and there is an ongoing
> session for this service in the cell where the UE is situated, i.e.
> MTCH and MCCH are available

\- act on RRC messages received on MCCH and:

\- if the MBMS service requires the establishment of an RRC Connection
due to counting response or due to the utilisation of p-t-p transfer
mode for the MBMS service:

\- inform upper layers that the MBMS Service requires the establishment
of an RRC Connection.

\- if the MBMS service does not require the establishment of an RRC
Connection :

\- listen to the common transport channel on which the MTCH is mapped.

\- if the UE determines that a neighbouring cell is suitable for
selective or soft combining and the UE has valid MBMS NEIGHBOURING CELL
INFORMATION of that cell:

> \- performs selective or soft combining of MTCH between the selected
> cell and the neighbouring cell.

### 7.3.2 MBMS Reception in RRC Connected Mode: URA\_PCH state

In URA\_PCH, the UE shall:

> \- if the UE supports MBMS and
>
> \- if the UE has activated an MBMS service and there is an ongoing
> session for this service in the URA where the UE is situated, i.e.
> MTCH and MCCH are available

\- act on RRC messages received on MCCH,

> \- if on the MCCH it is indicated that the MBMS service in the cell
> requires a counting response or is due to the utilisation of p-t-p
> transfer mode for the MBMS service:
>
> \- initiate a cell update procedure, for sending MBMS COUNTING
> RESPONSE, or MBMS P-T-P Modification Request signalling flow. The
> cause to be used in the cell update procedure is defined in \[13\].

\- for each MBMS service that the UE has activated and where
transmission on a MTCH is indicated in the MCCH, listen to the common
transport channel on which the MTCH is mapped,

\- if the UE determines that a neighbouring cell is suitable for
selective or soft combining and the UE has valid MBMS NEIGHBOURING CELL
INFORMATION of that cell

\- performs selective or soft combining of MTCH between the selected
cell and the neighbouring cell.

### 7.3.3 MBMS Reception in RRC Connected Mode: CELL\_PCH state

In CELL\_PCH, the UE shall:

> \- if the UE supports MBMS and
>
> \- if the UE has activated an MBMS service and there is an ongoing
> session for this service in the cell where the UE is situated, i.e.
> MTCH and MCCH are available

\- act on RRC messages received on MCCH

> \- if on the MCCH it is indicated that the MBMS service in the cell
> requires counting response or is due to the utilisation of p-t-p
> transfer mode for the MBMS service:

8 UTRAN Signalling Flows for MBMS 
=================================

8.1 MBMS High Level Signalling Scenarios
----------------------------------------

### 8.1.1 Session start

Upon receiving a session start indication from CN, UTRAN initiates the
session start sequence to allocate radio resources to UEs for receiving
the MBMS content. As part of this sequence, UTRAN may apply the counting
procedure (counting the number of idle mode, URA\_PCH, CELL\_PCH and
CELL\_FACH state UEs) to decide whether to use the p-t-m or p-t-p
transfer mode. For MBMS Broadcast mode, the applicability of the
counting procedure for a service is indicated by the CN.

The Figure 8.1.1 shows an example of a possible session start sequence.

Figure 8.1.1: Session start

In general, the session start sequence involves the following steps:

-   In case UTRAN applies counting to determine the most optimal
    transfer mode the following steps are performed:

    -   UTRAN sets the correct MBMS Notification Indicator (NI) and
        sends the MBMS CHANGE INFORMATION and the MBMS ACCESS
        INFORMATION including service ID, the session ID if received
        from the CN, and access probability on MCCH.

    -   Upon DRX wakeup, UEs in idle mode as well as UEs in CELL\_PCH,
        URA\_PCH and CELL \_FACH not receiving an MBMS service provided
        in p-t-m transfer mode evaluate the MBMS NI and if set, read the
        MBMS CHANGE INFORMATION from MCCH at beginning of the
        modification period. UEs in idle mode as well as UEs in
        CELL\_PCH, URA\_PCH and CELL \_FACH receiving an MBMS service
        provided in p-t-m transfer mode read the MBMS CHANGE INFORMATION
        directly. If service Id of activated MBMS service and session ID
        that the UE has not received is indicated in MBMS CHANGE
        INFORMATION UEs continue reading the rest of MCCH information.
        Upon receiving the MBMS ACCESS INFORMATION including access
        probability, UEs in idle mode or URA\_PCH, CELL\_PCH, and
        CELL\_FACH state for which the probability check passes,
        initiate counting response. UTRAN counts the UEs with an
        activated MBMS service by combining the UE linking from CN and
        received counting responses from UEs.

    -   In the case that no UE is counted as present in the cell then
        UTRAN may decide not to provide any RB for the service in the
        cell.

    -   In case a pre- defined threshold is reached, UTRAN applies the
        p-t-m RB establishment procedure specified below. Otherwise,
        UTRAN may repeat the MBMS ACCESS INFORMATION a number of times,
        using different probability values. If the threshold is not
        reached, UTRAN applies the p-t-p RB establishment procedure

-   In case UTRAN selects the p-t-m RB establishment procedure:

    -   UTRAN configures MTCH and updates MCCH (MBMS Service InfoRMATION
        and MBMS RADIO BEARER INFORMATION) by including the service ID,
        the session ID if received from the CN, and p-t-m RB information
        for the concerned MBMS service

    -   In case p-t-m RB establishment is not preceded by counting,
        UTRAN sets the correct MBMS Notification Indicator (NI) and
        sends MBMS CHANGE INFORMATION.

    -   UTRAN sends the MBMS dedicated notification message including
        the service ID and cause= session start on DCCH to inform UEs in
        CELL\_DCH that are not receiving an MBMS service provided using
        p-t-m transfer mode

    -   In case p-t-m RB establishment is preceded by counting, UEs read
        MCCH at the pre- defined time(s) to acquire the MBMS Service
        InforMATION and MBMS RADIO BEARER INFORMATION

    -   In case p-t-m RB establishment is not preceded by counting, Upon
        DRX wakeup, UEs not receiving MTCH evaluate the MBMS NI and if
        set, read MCCH at beginning of modification period to acquire
        MBMS CHANGE INFORMATION. UEs in idle mode as well as UEs in
        CELL\_PCH, URA\_PCH and CELL \_FACH receiving an MBMS service
        provided in p-t-m transfer mode read the MBMS CHANGE INFORMATION
        directly. If service Id of activated MBMS service and session ID
        that the UE has not received is indicated in MBMS CHANGE
        INFORMATION UEs continue reading the rest of MCCH information to
        acquire the MBMS Service Information and MBMS RADIO BEARER
        INFORMATION

    -   UEs that are incapable of receiving the MTCH for the session
        that is started in parallel to the existing activity notify the
        user. This enables the user to choose between the ongoing
        activity and the new MBMS service

    -   Upon receiving MBMS dedicated notification with cause= session
        start, UEs in CELL\_DCH that are incapable of receiving the MCCH
        and the corresponding MTCH in parallel to the existing activity
        notify the user. This enables the user to choose between the
        ongoing activity and the new MBMS service. If the user decides
        to receive the new MBMS service, the UE shall read MCCH to
        acquire the MBMS Service InfoRMATION and MBMS RADIO BEARER
        INFORMATION.

    -   Upon receiving the MBMS Service InfoRMATION and the MBMS RB
        INFORMATION including the p-t-m RB information for the concerned
        MBMS service, the UE starts receiving the p-t-m radio bearers

-   In case UTRAN selects the p-t-p RB establishment procedure:

    -   UTRAN indicates on MCCH in MBMS CHANGE INFORMATION that MBMS
        service is provided via p-t-p

    -   After receiving MBMS CHANGE INFORMATION UEs with an activated
        MBMS service, after possible service priorisation, request MBMS
        p-t-p RB establishment by sending MBMS P-T-P Modification
        Request signalling flow.

    -   Furthermore, UTRAN establishes the p-t-p RB by means of
        appropriate RRC procedures e.g. the RB setup procedure

    -   UEs establish the p-t-p radio bearers by means of the RRC
        procedure selected by UTRAN eg. the RB setup procedure

    -   UTRAN updates MCCH (MBMS Service Info) to inform UEs joining or
        entering the cell at a later point in time.

### 8.1.2 Joining (during a session)

In case the user wants to join an MBMS service (before or during a
session), the UE initiates NAS procedures (e.g. MBMS service
activation).

If no session is ongoing upon completion of the joining procedure, the
joining procedure is transparent to the AS.

In case a session using p-t-m transfer mode is ongoing upon completion
of the joining procedure, the UE may initiate reception of the p-t-m
radio bearers. In case the ongoing session applies p-t-p transfer mode,
UTRAN may establish the p-t-p radio bearers. UTRAN would do this upon
receiving a UE linking indication from CN, which normally follows the
joining. As a result of the UE linking, UTRAN may decide to change the
transfer mode from p-t-p to p-t-m. This change of transfer mode is out
of the scope of this sequence (to be covered by a separate sequence).

The Figure 8.1.2 shows an example of a possible joining sequence.

Figure 8.1.2: Joining with continuation of p-t-m

In general, the joining sequence involves the following steps:

-   UEs in idle mode first perform RRC connection establishment, while
    UEs in CELL\_PCH and URA\_PCH first perform cell update

-   UEs initiate the joining procedure (NAS)

-   In case UTRAN continues to use the p-t-m transfer mode:

    -   UTRAN sends the MBMS dedicated notification message on DCCH
        including the service ID and cause= session ongoing to inform
        UEs in CELL\_DCH

    -   Upon receiving MBMS dedicated notification with cause= session
        ongoing, UEs in CELL\_DCH that are incapable of receiving the
        MCCH and the corresponding MTCH in parallel to the existing
        activity notify the upper layer. This enables the user to choose
        between the ongoing activity and the new MBMS service. If the
        user chooses to receive the new MBMS service or if the UE in
        Cell\_DCH is capable of receiving MCCH and MTCH in parallel to
        the existing activity, the UE shall read MCCH to acquire the
        MBMS Service InfoRMATION and MBMS RADIO BEARER INFORMATION from
        MCCH.

    -   Upon acquiring the MBMS Service InfoRMATION and the MBMS RADIO
        BEARER INFORMATION including the p-t-m RB information for the
        concerned MBMS service, the UE starts receiving the p-t-m radio
        bearers

-   In case UTRAN continues using the p-t-p transfer mode:

    -   UTRAN establishes the p-t-p RB by means of appropriate RRC
        procedures eg. the RB setup procedure

    -   UEs establish the p-t-p radio bearers by means of the RRC
        procedure selected by UTRAN eg. the RB setup procedure.

### 8.1.3 Recounting

During a p-t-m MBMS session, UTRAN may perform re- counting to verify if
p-t-m is still the optimal transfer mode. The purpose of the re-
counting procedure is to count the number of idle mode, URA\_PCH,
CELL\_PCH, and CELL\_FACH state UEs that have joined a specific service.
As a result of this procedure, UTRAN may decide to change the transfer
mode from p-t-m to p-t-p. This change of transfer mode is outside the
scope of this sequence (to be covered by a separate sequence).

The Figure 8.1.3 shows an example of a possible recounting sequence.

Figure 8.1.3: Recounting with continuation of p-t-m

In case UTRAN applies re- counting to determine the most optimal
transfer mode, the following steps are performed:

-   UTRAN sends the MBMS CHANGE INFORMATION and the MBMS ACCESS
    INFORMATION including service ID, and access probability on MCCH

-   UEs in idle mode as well as UEs in CELL\_PCH, URA\_PCH and CELL
    \_FACH receiving an MBMS service provided in p-t-m transfer mode
    read the MBMS CHANGE INFORMATION at the beginning of each
    modification period. If service Id of activated MBMS service is
    indicated in MBMS CHANGE INFORMATION UEs continue reading the rest
    of MCCH information.

-   Upon receiving the MBMS ACCESS INFORMATION including access
    probability, UEs in idle mode or URA\_PCH, CELL\_PCH and CELL\_FACH
    state for which the probability check passes, initiate counting
    response.

-   UTRAN counts the UEs with an activated MBMS service by combining the
    UE linking from CN and received counting responses from UEs.

-   In the case that no UE is counted as present in the cell then UTRAN
    may decide not to provide any RB for the service in the cell.

-   In case a pre- defined threshold is reached, UTRAN continues using
    the p-t-m transfer mode. Otherwise, UTRAN may repeat the MBMS ACCESS
    INFORMATION a number of times, using different probability values.
    If the threshold is not reached, UTRAN switches transfer mode from
    p-t-m to p-t-p

-   In case UTRAN continues using the p-t-m transfer mode, it may return
    UEs that responded to counting back to idle mode by releasing the
    RRC connection.

### 8.1.4 Session stop

UTRAN may apply the session stop procedure to inform UEs that the end of
MTCH transmission concerns the end of a session rather than just an idle
period. The purpose of the procedure is to reduce the UE power
consumption.

The Figure 8.1.4 shows an example of a possible session stop sequence.

Figure 8.1.4: Session stop

In case UTRAN provides the service p-t-m, the session stop sequence
involves the following steps:

-   UTRAN updates the MBMS CHANGE INFORMATION, MBMS SERVICE INFORMATION
    and the MBMS RADIO BEARER INFORMATION including the service ID and
    the explicit radio bearer release indicator. UTRAN updates MCCH
    (MBMS SERVICE INFORMATION) to inform UEs joining or entering the
    cell in a later point of time.

-   UEs in idle mode as well as UEs in CELL\_PCH, URA\_PCH and CELL
    \_FACH receiving an MBMS service provided in p-t-m transfer mode
    read the MBMS CHANGE INFORMATION at the beginning of the each
    modification period. If service Id of activated MBMS service is
    indicated in MBMS CHANGE INFORMATION UEs continue reading the rest
    of MCCH information.

-   Upon receiving this information the UE stops receiving the MTCH

In case UTRAN provides the service p-t-p, the session stop sequence
involves the following steps:

-   UTRAN releases the p-t-p radio bearers and updates MCCH (MBMS
    Service Info) to inform UEs joining or entering the cell at a later
    point in time.

8.2 MBMS RNC Signalling Flows
-----------------------------

### 8.2.1 MBMS Session Start procedure

Figure 8.2.1: MBMS Session Start procedure. Successful operation.

The MBMS Session Start procedure is initiated by the CN when an MBMS
Session is started. The MBMS SESSION START REQUEST is sent to each RNC
that is connected to the CN (in case of Iu-flex the RNC may receive more
than one MBMS SESSION START REQUEST message).

The MBMS SESSION START REQUEST contains the MBMS Service Id, and
optionally the MBMS Session ID, MBMS Bearer Service Type and the MBMS
Session Attributes (MBMS Service Area Information, QoS parameters...) It
may also include a list of RAs which lists each RA that contains at
least one PMM-IDLE UE that has activated the service.

MBMS Session Start procedure also provides the MBMS Iu Data Bearer
Establishment functionality. In case of Iu-flex the RNC shall not
establish more than one MBMS Iu bearer for a certain service towards a
pool area and shall inform the respective CN nodes accordingly.

MBMS Session Start procedure may also be initiated by the CN to restore
the MBMS service following an RNC failure or an Iu path failure as
specified in TS 23.007 \[15\].

The MBMS Session Start procedure in case of IP Multicast is described in
section 8.2.16.

### 8.2.2 MBMS Session Update procedure

Figure 8.2.2: MBMS Session Update procedure. Successful operation.

The MBMS Session Update procedure is initiated by the CN when an MBMS
Session is ongoing and SGSN notices that there is a need to update the
list of RAs. The MBMS SESSION UPDATE REQUEST contains the MBMS Service
Id, and e.g. List of RAs with PMM Idle UEs..

### 8.2.3 MBMS Session Stop procedure

Figure 8.2.3: MBMS Session Stop procedure.

This signalling flow depicts the MBMS Session Stop procedure.

This procedure is initiated by the CN to the RNCs with an ongoing MBMS
session, when no more data will be sent for that MBMS service for some
period of time.

The MBMS Session Stop procedure also provides the MBMS Iu Data Bearer
Release functionality.

### 8.2.4 RNC Registration procedure

Figure 8.2.4: MBMS Registration procedure.

This signalling flow depicts the MBMS Registration procedure.

This procedure is initiated by the RNC in the case that the RNC is not
SRNC for any UE that has joined the MBMS Service, but this RNC is DRNC
for PMM-CONNECTED UEs that have joined the MBMS Service and there is no
MBMS Service Context for the MBMS Service in this RNC.

This procedure shall be initiated by the DRNC, as soon as a UE link is
received over the Iur and there exists no MBMS Service Context for the
MBMS service for which the UE link is received.

### 8.2.5 RNC De-Registration procedure

Figure 8.2.5: RNC MBMS De-Registration procedure.

This signalling flow depicts the RNC De-Registration procedure. This
procedure is initiated by the RNC towards the CN node it was registered
to in case the RNC is not acting as a Serving RNC for any UE that has
activated the MBMS Service and has ceased to act as a Drift RNC for UEs
which has activated an MBMS service.

### 8.2.6 CN De-Registration procedure

Figure 8.2.6: CN MBMS De-Registration procedure.

This signalling flow depicts the CN De-Registration procedure.

This procedure is initiated by the CN in order to inform the RNC that a
certain MBMS Service is no longer available.

### 8.2.7 MBMS Channel Type Switching over Uu

Figure 8.2.7: Channel type switching signalling flow from p-t-m to
p-t-p.

The CRNC is responsible for the decision regarding having p-t-m
transmission or no p-t-m transmission in a cell for a specific MBMS
service. The CRNC informs all the SRNCs having UEs in that cell about
its decision. The SRNC is the RNC controlling the RRC connection and RBs
to a specific UE. In the example shown, the CRNC decided to no longer
use p-t-m, then the SRNC decided to perform channel type switching to
deliver the MBMS service over DTCH mapped on a dedicated channel. The RB
SETUP message contains the MBMS Service Id. It is FFS whether the SRNC
always follows the CRNC\'s request or not.

NOTE: the channel type switching in this case includes a change of both
transport and logical channels.

### 8.2.8 MBMS UE Linking

Figure 8.2.8: MBMS UE linking signalling flow

This signalling flow is only applicable for handling UEs in
PMM-CONNECTED mode with activated MBMS Services.

The signalling flow is used to link a specific UE to one or several MBMS
service contexts in the SRNC. The MBMS UE LINKING REQUEST message
contains the whole list of MBMS Service Ids and MBMS PTP RAB IDs (e.g.
mapped from NSAPIs) activated by the UE. If there has not been an MBMS
service context related to an MBMS Service Id then SRNC creates an MBMS
service context as a result of this procedure.

### 8.2.9 MBMS UE De-Linking

Figure 8.2.9: MBMS UE De-linking signalling flow

This signalling flow is only applicable for handling UEs in
PMM-CONNECTED mode with activated MBMS Services.

The signalling flow is used to remove a specific UE from one or several
MBMS service context in the SRNC. The MBMS UE DE-LINKING REQUEST message
contains the list of MBMS Service Ids de-activated by the UE.

### 8.2.10 MBMS Service Id Request

Figure 8.2.10: MBMS Service Id list over Iu signalling flow

This signalling flow is applicable for handling MBMS to UEs in
RRC-Connected, PMM-IDLE state. The list of MBMS services the user has
joined is sent over Iu.

The purpose of this signalling flow is to perform UE linking for a RRC
connected, PMM idle user. The UE provides an indication that the user
has joined at least one MBMS service and the PS Domain specific IDNNS
(the message that would carry this information is FFS) whenever an Iu-cs
connection is established and the UE is PMM idle (that is there is no
Iu-ps connection), The RNC requests the MBMS services the UE has joined
from the SGSN (or the SGSN the UE is attached to in case of Iu-flex)
using a connectionless procedure. The MBMS SERVICE ID REQ contains the
IMSI of the UE. The SGSN response contains the full list of MBMS
services the user has joined.

The MBMS service list is then stored in the RNC. The list is deleted
when the UE moves to RRC idle and the RRC context is removed in the RNC.

### 8.2.11 MBMS Attach/Detach over Iur

Figure 8.2.11-1: MBMS attach request signalling flow: Successful
Operation.

This signalling flow is only applicable for handling UEs in RRC
connected mode with activated MBMS Services.

The purpose of this signalling flow is

-   to either allow the CRNC to add one or several new UEs to the total
    number of UEs in a given cell using one or several MBMS services.
    The MBMS ATTACH REQUEST then contains the Cell Id of the new cell
    (may contain the URA Id of the new URA for UEs in URA\_PCH state),
    the whole list of affected MBMS Service Ids and a UTRAN specific UE
    Identification if necessary.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   or to allow the SRNC to inform the DRNC in which URA notifications
    > for MBMS Services have to be sent. The MBMS ATTACH REQUEST then
    > contains a list of URAs and the corresponding MBMS Services.

Figure 8.2.11-2: MBMS detach request signalling flow: Successful
Operation.

This signalling flow is only applicable for handling UEs in RRC
connected mode with activated MBMS Services.

The purpose of this signalling flow is

-   to either allow the CRNC to decrease the total number of UEs
    > receiving one or several MBMS service in a given cell. The MBMS
    > DETACH REQUEST contains the Cell Id of the old cell (may contain
    > the URA Id of the old URA for UEs in URA\_PCH state), the whole
    > list of affected MBMS Service Ids and a UTRAN specific UE
    > Identification if necessary.

-   or to allow the SRNC to inform the DRNC in which URA there is not
    > anymore a need to send notifications for MBMS Services due to the
    > presence of UEs in URA\_PCH. The MBMS DETACH REQUEST then contains
    > a list of URAs and the corresponding MBMS Services

### 8.2.12 MBMS Channel Type Reconfiguration over Iur

These signalling flows need further study.

Figure 8.2.12: Channel Type Reconfiguration signalling flow: Successful
Operation.

This signalling flow is only applicable for handling MBMS UEs in RRC
connected mode.

The purpose of this signalling flow is that the CRNC informs the
selected channel type to the SRNCs used in a cell under the CRNC. The
MBMS CHANNEL TYPE RECONFIGURATION INDICATION contains a list of U-RNTI,
Channel type and MBMS Service Id corresponding to the UEs connected to
the SRNC.

### 8.2.13 Information Exchange over Iur

These signalling flows is used by the DRNC to acquire the MBMS related
information for MBMS service identified by TMGI and is used between the
RNCs, which are controlling cells neighbouring to each other for
selective/soft combining in case of inter-RNC synchronization.

Figure 8.2.13: Information Exchange Initiation signalling flow:
Successful Operation.

The purpose of this signalling flow is that the DRNC request the APN and
IP multicast address for an MBMS service. The INFORMATION EXCHANGE
INITIATION REQUEST includes the TMGI for which the APN and IP multicast
address are requested. In the INFORMATION EXCHANGE INITIATION RESPONSE
message, the corresponding APN and IP multicast address are included.

If the Information Exchange procedure is started and the transmission
mode is changed, this shall be reported by the INFORMATION REPORT
message.

And the additional purpose of this signalling flow used in case of
inter-RNC synchronization is

\- to request the external neighbouring RNC(s) to provide the counting
results in cells the neighbouring RNC controls

\- to request the external neighbouring RNC(s) to inform about the
transmission mode change in cells the neighbouring RNC controls for a
MBMS session

\- to request the external neighbouring RNC(s) to provide the MBMS PTM
RB configuration used in cells the neighbouring RNC controls

\- to request the external neighbouring RNC(s) to provide the RLC
Sequence Number.

### 8.2.14 MBMS RAB Establishment Indication

Figure 8.2.14: MBMS RAB Establishment Indication procedure

This signalling flow is used by the RNC to indicate to the CN the
establishment of the MBMS RAB corresponding to the MBMS Iu signalling
connection.

When the RNC decides not to establish an MBMS Iu bearer, for a
particular MBMS service, during MBMS Session Start procedure, for
example the RNC does not control any contained in MBMS Service Area
Information and the RNC does not belong to any of the RA in a list of
RAs which lists each RA that contains at least one PMM-IDLE UE but later
when a UE linking (via Iu or Iur) is performed or as a result (p-t-p
decision) of channel type reconfiguration in another RNC, the RNC
establishes the Iu bearer and uses this procedure to inform the CN that
an Iu bearer has been established.

If Iu-Flex is active, the selection of the CN node is implementation
dependant.

The MBMS RAB ESTABLISHMENT INDICATION message contains the *Transport
Layer Address* IE and the *Iu Transport Association* IE.

### 8.2.15 MBMS RAB Release

Figure 8.2.15: MBMS RAB Release Request procedure.

This signalling flow is used by the RNC to indicate to the CN to request
the release of an MBMS RAB.

At reception of the MBMS RAB RELEASE REQUEST message the CN should
initiate the release of all MBMS resources related to the Iu connection
without releasing the Iu signalling connection.

The RNC shall at reception of MBMS RAB RELEASE initiate the release of
the related MBMS RAB resources.

The MBMS RAB release may be initiated e.g. for the following reasons
(unexhausted):

\- There are lack of rafio resource in UTRAN and RNC decided to pre-empt
an MBMS RAB for a on-going MBMS session based on Allocation/Retention
Priority

\- When there are no UEs with a given activated MBMS service consuming
radio resources in cells under the RNC or the RNC is controlling UEs in
cells under another RNC;

\- In case of channel type switching from ptp to ptm in cells under
control of another RNC in its role of DRNC;

\- There are no cells under the RNC which are part of the RA List Of
Idle UEs if received.

### 8.2.16 MBMS Session Start procedure in case of IP Multicast transport

Figure 8.2.16-1: MBMS Session Start procedure. Successful operation.

The MBMS Session Start procedure is initiated by the CN when an MBMS
Session is started. The MBMS SESSION START REQUEST is sent to each RNC
that is connected to the CN (in case of Iu-flex the RNC may receive more
than one MBMS SESSION START REQUEST message).

The MBMS SESSION START REQUEST contains the MBMS Service Id, and
optionally the MBMS Session ID, MBMS Bearer Service Type, the MBMS
Session Attributes (MBMS Service Area Information, QoS parameters, ...)
and Transport Layer Address used for the IP-multicast and Iu Transport
Association (DL TEID) IE. In addition in case PDCP is used for the MBMS
service the PDCP information is included. It may also include a list of
RAs which lists each RA that contains at least one PMM-IDLE UE that has
activated the service.

The RNC stores the session attributes in the MBMS Service Context, sets
the state attribute of its MBMS Service Context to \'Active\' and joins
the IP Multicast group, which is used for the User data delivery of this
MBMS session between the GGSN and RNCs in case radio resource is
available. In case of successful joining the indicated IP Multicast
group the RNC replies to the CN nodes from which it has received the
MBMS Session Start Request message that the IP Multicast Bearer setup
was successful and establishes the radio resource for the transfer of
MBMS data to the interested UEs.

### 8.2.17 MBSFN MCCH Information

![](media/image37.wmf){width="3.7125in" height="1.05in"}

Figure 8.2.17-1: MBSFN MCCH Information procedure, Successful Operation

The signalling flow shall be used only if MRNC is used for MBSFN
operation.

The MBSFN MCCH INFORMATION message contains the MCCH messages list sent
on the MRNC and the MCCH configuration information of the MRNC.

The signalling flow is used by the MRNC to inform the CRNC of the MCCH
configuration and scheduling information used in MRNC upon receipt of
MBMS SESSION START message from CN.

The CRNC shall prepare the setup of the requested MBMS sessions upon
receipt of MBMS SESSION START message from CN，then instead of preparing
RRC messages and physical configuration, wait for the MBSFN MCCH
INFORMATION message that is sent from MRNC.

Upon receipt of the MBSFN MCCH INFORMATION message, if the *MCCH
Configuration* IE exists, the CRNC shall setup or reconfigure the MCCH
of all cells in the MBSFN cluster with the configuration contained in
this IE, and update the System Information of these cells.

The CRNC shall decode the *L3 Information* IE contained in the *MCCH
Message List* IE and apply the RLC/MAC/PHY configuration specified by
relative MCCH Message to setup the RB information of MTCH, and then send
the *L3 Information* IE on the MCCH in the receiving sequence at the
beginning of the first MCCH modification period following the CFN
carried in the message.

8.3 MBMS Uu Signalling Flows
----------------------------

### 8.3.1 Broadcast of MBMS System Information

Figure 8.3.1: Broadcast of MBMS system information.

This signalling flow is applicable for handling MBMS to UEs in PMM IDLE
and PMM-CONNECTED mode.

The purpose of the signalling flow is for UTRAN to broadcast MBMS system
information to UEs using the BCCH. The MBMS SYSTEM INFORMATION shall be
repeatedly transmitted after its first transmission. Upon receiving the
first MBMS SYSTEM INFORMATION, the UE shall establish the radio bearer
carrying an MCCH.

The MBMS SYSTEM INFORMATION includes:

> \- MCCH schedule information (access info, repetition and modification
> periods)

\- Configuration of a radio bearer carrying an MCCH

More information may be included in the MBMS SYSTEM INFORMATION.

### 8.3.2 MBMS Service Information

Figure 8.3.2: MBMS service information signalling flow

This signalling flow is applicable for handling MBMS to UEs in PMM IDLE
and PMM-CONNECTED mode.

The purpose of the signalling flow is for RNC to inform UEs of all of
MBMS services available in one cell. The MBMS SERVICE INFORMATION shall
be transmitted periodically on MCCH to provide an indication of the
status of the MBMS service in the cell and to support mobility.

The MBMS SERVICE INFORMATION contains MBMS service ids, optionally the
MBMS Session ID, and an indication of the service status in the cell
i.e. whether it is provided by p-t-m or p-t-p bearers or whether
explicit release is indicated. The MBMS service ids indicate the MBMS
services which are being served in the cell or the MBMS services which
can be served if the UE requests it. P-t-m indication indicates that the
MBMS service is on p-t-m in the cell, thus it informs the UE of the need
of reception of the MBMS RADIO BEARER INFORMATION.

### 8.3.3 MBMS Radio Bearer Information

Figure 8.3.3: MBMS radio bearer information signalling flow

This signalling flow is applicable for handling MBMS to UEs in IDLE and
PMM-CONNECTED mode.

The purpose of the signalling flow is for the RNC to inform UE(s)
regarding the MTCH radio bearer information. MBMS RADIO BEARER
INFORMATION is only available for p-t-m transmission. MBMS RADIO BEARER
INFORMATION shall be transmitted periodically on MCCH to support
mobility in the MBMS service.

MBMS RADIO BEARER INFORMATION includes MBMS Service Id, radio bearer,
transport channel and physical channel information per MBMS service.

### 8.3.4 MBMS Access Information

Figure 8.3.4: MBMS Access Information signalling flow

This signalling flow is applicable for handling MBMS UEs in IDLE mode or
URA\_PCH, CELL\_PCH, CELL\_FACH state.

The purpose of the signalling flow is for the RNC to inform UE(s) with
particular activated MBMS service of the potential need to make an MBMS
Counting Response i.e. establish an RRC connection or make a cell
update. The MBMS ACCESS INFORMATION is transmitted during counting and
re-counting on MCCH. The MBMS ACCESS INFORMATION includes, for each
service for which counting is required, the MBMS service identifier,
probability factors for idle and connected modes and an indication of
the connected mode states to which the signalling flow applies.

### 8.3.5 MBMS Neighbouring Cell Information

Figure 8.3.5: MBMS Neighbouring Cell Information signalling flow

This signalling flow is applicable for handling MBMS to UEs in PMM IDLE
and CONNECTED mode.

The purpose of the MBMS NEIGHBOURING CELL INFORMATION signalling flow is
for the UTRAN to inform to UEs of the MTCH configuration of the
neighbouring cells which are available for selective combining. In case
of partial soft combining, the MBMS NEIGBOURING CELL INFORMATION
contains the L1-combining schedule, which indicates when the soft
combining is applicable between the specific S-CCPCH of the cell and the
specific S-CCPCH of the neighbouring cell. With MBMS NEIGHBOURING CELL
INFORMATION the UE is able to receive MTCH transmission from
neighbouring cell without reception of the MCCH of that cell. The MBMS
NEIGHBOURING CELL INFORMATION shall be repeatedly transmitted on MCCH
when selective or soft combining is utilized in the MBMS p-t-m
transmission in the given cell group.

### 8.3.6 MBMS Joined Indication {#mbms-joined-indication .list-paragraph}

Figure 8.3.6: MBMS joined indication signalling flow

This signalling flow is applicable for handling MBMS to UEs in
RRC-Connected, PMM-IDLE state. The MBMS JOINED INDICATION is sent over
the DCCH.

The signalling flow is initiated by the UE after entering RRC-Connected,
PMM-IDLE state. The purpose of the signalling flow is to enable the UE
to inform the SRNC that the user has joined at least one MBMS service.
The SRNC requests the MBMS services the UE has joined from the SGSN as
defined in subclause 8.2.10.

In SRNC relocation this information is transmitted from source RNC to
target RNC.

NOTE: If SRNC has valid linking information the complete service list of
activated services is also transmitted from source RNC to target RNC in
SRNC relocation.

### 8.3.7 MTCH Scheduling Information

Figure 8.3.7: MTCH scheduling information.

This signalling flow is applicable for handling MBMS to UEs in PMM IDLE
and CONNECTED mode.

The purpose of the signalling flow is to enable UEs to perform
discontinuous reception of MTCH. The UE may discontinuously receive MTCH
based on scheduling information indicated by the MTCH SCHEDULING
INFORMATION. This signalling is transmitted on MSCH mapped on SCCPCH
carrying MTCH. The MTCH SCHEDULING INFORMATION is signalled on each MSCH
repetition period. The MSCH repetition period and the offset from the
cell timing are indicated on MCCH. In case of soft combining, the MSCH
repetition period is same for all soft combinable S-CCPCH. The
scheduling information allows to cover different periods for different
MBMS services.

The MTCH SCHEDULING INFORMATION includes for each service:

> \- MBMS service Id (the actual coding is defined in stage-3).
>
> \- Beginning and duration of MBMS data transmission (one contiguous
> block or more is defined in Stage-3).
>
> \- Duration can be infinite (no DTX). This option could be signalled
> in the MCCH (Stage-3 definition).
>
> \- Indication of no MBMS data transmission for either this period or
> several consecutive periods (a period is expressed in MSCH repetition
> period).

### 8.3.8 MBMS Change Information

Figure 8.3.8: MBMS change information.

This signalling flow is applicable for handling MBMS to UEs in PMM IDLE
and CONNECTED mode. UTRAN should transmit this signalling flow in
beginning of each modification period on MCCH and repeat it at least in
every repetition period of that modification period. UE shall read this
information flow when detecting that MICH bits set for a service that UE
has activated, or periodically at the begin of each modification period
when receiving MTCH.

The purpose of the signalling flow is to indicate MBMS services whose
MCCH information is changed in that modification period. The content of
MBMS CHANGE INFORMATIO shall be minimized, so that the MCCH reading time
for the UEs, activated MBMS service whose MCCH information is not
modified on that modification period, is minimized.

The MBMS CHANGE INFORMATION includes:

> \- The MBMS service Ids for which MCCH information is modified on that
> modification period.

### 8.3.9 MBMS P-T-P Modification Request

Figure 8.3.9: MBMS P-T-P Modification Request.

This signalling flow is applicable for handling UEs with an activated
service that requires MBMS p-t-p RB in PMM IDLE and CONNECTED mode. In
idle mode, URA\_PCH and CELL\_PCH states the UE may transmit this
signalling flow to request the setup of a p-t-p MBMS RB after receiving
the indication on MCCH that p-t-p transfer mode is utilised or, in
CELL\_DCH state, to request the release of the p-t-p MBMS RB due to
higher priority MBMS service, or to indicate the frequency used for
transmitting the higher priority service as specified in subclause
5.2.8. This signalling flow is transmitted on DCCH or on CCCH dependent
upon UE state.

UEs in idle mode are required to perform RRC connection establishment
for sending this information flow. UEs that are in URA\_PCH or CELL\_PCH
state are required to make a cell update and UEs that are in CELL\_DCH
state transmit an MBMS MODIFICATION REQUEST message.

When UTRAN receives this message from the UE, the UTRAN may setup or
release the p-t-p MBMS RB by normal RB release procedure or , in the
case of a preferred frequency being indicated, it may perform
inter-frequency HHO.

The MBMS P-T-P Modification Request message includes the identity of the
MBMS service when the service appears in the list of MBMS Selected
Services.

### 8.3.10 MBMS Counting Response

Figure 8.3.10: MBMS Counting Response.

This signalling flow is applicable for UEs passing the probability check
in counting procedure in idle mode or URA\_PCH, CELL\_PCH or CELL\_FACH
state. For the UE in idle mode this signalling flow refers to the
complete RRC connection establishment procedure. For UEs in URA\_PCH,
CELL\_PCH and CELL\_FACH state this signalling flow refers to cell
update procedure.

The MBMS Counting Response message includes the identity of the MBMS
service when the service appears in the list of MBMS Selected Services.

### 8.3.11 MBMS Selected Services Information

Figure 8.3.11: MBMS Selected Services Information.

This signalling flow is applicable for UEs entering CELL\_DCH state. The
purpose of the signalling flow is to enable the UE to inform the SRNC
that the user requires the reception of MBMS Selected Services. When the
SRNC is not the CRNC of the UE, this signalling flow may interact with
the URA linking/de-linking described in subclause 5.1.10.

This signalling flow is also applicable for UEs in CELL\_DCH states,
when the list of MBMS Selected Services has been modified.

This signalling flow is also applicable for UEs in CELL\_PCH, URA\_PCH
and CELL\_FACH states when the list of MBMS Selected Services has been
modified by the upper layers and the MBMS Service appears in the MCCH of
the cell and the RNC has indicated in the MBMS GENERAL INFORMATION
message that it should be notified of a change to this list. If an MBMS
Service is contained in the list of MBMS Selected Services but is
currently not available in the cell, when the service appears on the
MCCH the UE does not perform this signalling flow.

The purpose of the signalling flow is to enable the UE to inform the
CRNC that the list of MBMS Selected Services in the UE has been
modified.

9 Security for MBMS
===================

Ciphering for MBMS multicast data is done between the BM-SC and the UE
as defined in \[7\]. Therefore, for MBMS p-t-m data transmissions no
radio interface ciphering is applied.

In case of p-t-p MBMS data transmissions, if the security is activated
for the UE the ciphering is also applied for p-t-p MBMS data RB as for
any other RB of the UE.

10 Mobility Procedures for MBMS
===============================

One of the requirements in \[5\] is: \"Data loss during cell change
should be minimal\". Therefore, when the UE receiving an MBMS session in
idle mode or connected mode (not including CELL\_DCH) re-selects between
cells, it should be possible to provide service continuity to this UE.

The following mechanism has been identified to minimise the data loss on
cell change.

10.1 Use of Periodical Transmission of MBMS Critical Information
----------------------------------------------------------------

In this mechanism, the cell periodically transmits an MBMS critical
information, informing all MBMS services currently configured for p-t-m
transmission or p-t-p transmission. If MBMS service is configured for
p-t-m transmission, the periodical transmission of MBMS critical
information may also contain the Radio Bearer information corresponding
to each MBMS service and Neighbouring cell information.

If the cell is configured for p-t-p transmission, then the UE would
perform a normal RRC connection establishment.

10.2 UE Actions for Mobility
----------------------------

The UE mobility between intra frequency cells is not affected by the
MBMS reception. The mobility between different frequency layers is
affected by the Frequency Layer Convergence process as defined in 11.2,
if used by the network.

In CELL\_FACH and in CELL\_DCH state the RRC operation has priority over
MBMS reception, thus UE performs the inter frequency and inter RAT
measurements as configured by the SRNC. UTRAN should utilize different
periodicities between MCCH transmissions and CELL\_FACH state
measurement occasion, such that CELL\_FACH state measurements and MCCH
transmissions are not constantly overlapping for some UE.

In Idle mode and in CELL\_PCH, URA\_PCH states the measurements are
performed as configured by the network based on the Release 5. The MBMS
specific measurement occasions to S-CCPCH for UEs in idle mode and in
CELL\_PCH, URA\_PCH states are not introduced and measurements have
priority over MBMS reception. The usage of channel protection (channel
coding) to recover some of the lost transport blocks is possible.

UEs may have DRx occasions for specific MBMS service when UE can stop
decoding S-CCPCH and perform measurements. DRx occasion are based on
scheduling information.

R\'99 standards have some means to reduce need for number of
measurements, which can be utilized for MBMS.

When the UE reselects the cell due to the mobility or returns to on
service from out of service, the UE shall acquire the MCCH information
if the activated MBMS service is available in the selected cell for the
reception of the service. The service is available when the session has
been already started and the service is being served on p-t-p/p-t-m in
the cell, or the service can be served in the cell if the UE requests
it.

If the MBMS service is available in the cell, the UE will perform an
action for the service reception in the cell. For example, if the
service is on p-t-p, the idle mode UE will initiate RRC connection
establishment procedure. Otherwise, the UE does not need to perform such
an action in the cell. The UE, which moves to the new cell, will operate
according to the RRC state/mode as follows.

Whenever the UE moves between p-t-m cells while continuing to receive a
service, UE shall receive MCCH information in a new cell, which includes
an MBMS cell group identity. If a UE moves between cells belong to the
same MBMS cell group based on the MCCH information, the UE does not need
to re- establish RLC entity and re- initialise PDCP entity for the
service received on MTCH. If a UE moves between cells belong to
different MBMS cell groups based on the MCCH information, the UE shall
re- establish RLC entity and re- initialise PDCP entity for the service
received on MTCH.

INFORMATION.

11 Resource Management for MBMS
===============================

11.1 MBMS Access Control Procedure
----------------------------------

MCCH messages initiating counting or recounting cause multiple responses
from UEs within a cell. This may result in RACH congestion if number of
UEs is high in a cell. To avoid this, CRNC may perform MBMS access
control procedure during counting or recounting procedure. MBMS access
control procedure is described in Figure 11.1.

Figure 11.1: MBMS Access Control Procedure

1\. CRNC calculates an initial probability factor for an MBMS service
when a MCCH message causing counting or recounting is about to be sent.
CRNC can use different probability factor for UEs in Idle mode and for
different UEs in URA\_PCH, CELL\_PCH and CELL\_FACH.

2\. CRNC includes the probability factor into the MCCH message and sends
it to UEs. This can be done in MBMS Group Notification.

3\. UEs in idle mode or in URA\_PCH, CELL\_PCH and CELL\_FACH state
passing the probability check performs counting response UEs keep
listening to MCCH to get updated probability factor until they have
successfully responded to counting or counting is no longer required.

4\. CRNC detects the probability factor needs to be updated. Detecting
mechanism is not to be standardized.

5\. CRNC recalculates the probability factor. The way of calculating new
probability factor is not to be standardized.

6\. CRNC includes the updated probability factor into the MCCH message
and sends it to UEs.

7\. UEs in idle mode or in URA\_PCH, CELL\_PCH or CELL\_FACH state that
pass the probability check, by using updated probability factor, perform
counting response.

CRNC and UEs that are still trying to perform the counting response
repeat step 3 \~ step 7 until e.g. counting or recounting procedure
ends.

11.2 Frequency layer Convergence
--------------------------------

Frequency Layer Convergence (FLC) denotes the process where the UTRAN
requests UEs to preferentially re-select to the frequency layer on which
the MBMS service is intended to be transmitted. This layer preference
could be done by an additional MBMS session related Layer Convergence
Information (LCI) such as offset and target frequency. The FLC is
supported by specifications for both networks utilizing HCS and for
networks not utilizing HCS.

The preferred layer (PL) is indicated per MBMS service and the LCI
(offset) is the same for all MBMS services on a given preferred layer.
UTRAN can consist of multiple preferred layers and the PL for given
services is decided by RRM. Thus the PL for an MBMS service might be
different in different parts of the service area. Network co-ordination
between RNCs may be added for the Rel-7. The CN may also request the RNC
(e.g. using "no-FLC-flag" value) not to apply any frequency layer
convergence mechanisms for the MBMS service (e.g. emergency service). In
case no PL info is specified for the MBMS service, the UE may assume
that the MBMS service is available on all frequencies.

The LCI can be signalled to UEs by the CRNC after the session start is
received over Iu interface until reception of the session stop. The UEs
shall take LCI into account whenever it is signalled on the MCCH in Idle
mode and URA\_PCH, CELL\_PCH and in CELL\_FACH states. The FLC is not
applicable in CELL\_DCH state, as it is only effecting UEs cell
re-selection procedure.

The UE shall ignore Sintersearch parameter only for the potential
preferred layers when LCI is signalled and on preferred layer the UE
shall apply the Sintersearch parameter. In case of UE is in CELL\_FACH
state without measurement occasions, the UE may not be able to measure
cells on preferred layers.

In the case that the UE has joined multiple services and they have
different frequencies as preferred layer, the UE should apply the FLC
applicable for the highest priority MBMS service, which it has activated
and has a PL. The priority setting of different MBMS services is decided
by NAS.

Based on RRM decision, a given MBMS service can be provided on
non-preferred layer by p-t-p or p-t-m transfer mode.

The details of the mechanism are defined in state 3.

11.3 Frequency layer Dispersion
-------------------------------

Frequency Layer Dispersion (FLD) denotes the process where the UTRAN
redistributes UEs across the frequencies. UTRAN can use FLD per MBMS
session.

For FDD, the FLD is applicable in Idle mode, URA\_PCH, CELL\_PCH and
CELL\_FACH states.

For TDD, the FLD is applicable in Idle mode, URA\_PCH and CELL\_PCH
states.

When FLC is applied, the UE stores the frequency where it was camped
previously. Upon session stop or service deactivation, the UE attempts
to return to that frequency.

If the UE does not find a suitable cell on the target frequency, the UE
attempts to select a cell on a randomly chosen frequency.

Dispersion applies when the MBMS session on the MBMS preferred frequency
ends, or when the MBMS service on the MBMS preferred frequency is
deactivated by the UE. Dispersion does not apply in the case where the
UE decides to receive another service for which FLC is applied.

The details of the mechanism are defined in the stage 3.

######## Annex A (informative): MBMS Phases in UTRAN

Figure A: Timeline of MBMS Service

The UTRAN MBMS behavior is divided into 3 phases. Figure A illustrates
the timeline of an MBMS service with regards to these phases.

A1 Security for MBMS
====================

A cell stays in phase 1, if there is no ongoing session for the MBMS
service, or if it does not belong to the MBMS service area of the
service.

A UE that has joined an MBMS service may regularly try to receive MBMS
notification in a cell \[FFS\]. At this phase the UE does not request
service delivery to UTRAN.

A2 MBMS Phase 2
===============

This phase starts when UTRAN receives the MBMS \"session start\" from
CN, and ends when UTRAN initially sets up MBMS radio bearer for the
session, or decides not to set up the MBMS radio bearer in a cell.

In this phase, UTRAN transmits notification to UEs about the incoming
service and could perform counting procedure to decide the type of MBMS
radio bearer. UTRAN decides whether to set up p-t-m, p-t-p radio bearer
or no radio bearer, based on the number of UEs that expected to receive
the service in the cell. A UE that has at least one activated MBMS
service acts on an RRC message in MCCH.

A3 MBMS Phase 3
===============

This phase starts after initial MBMS radio bearer setup and ends when
UTRAN receives the MBMS \"session stop\" from CN.

In this phase, UTRAN transmits the data for the MBMS service received
from CN using, if any, the established radio bearer. If there is no
set-up radio bearer, UTRAN waits for service delivery request from UE.
Recounting and radio bearer reconfiguration may be performed during this
phase.

UTRAN behaviour in this phase can be divided into three states: no
transmission, p-t-p transmission, and p-t-m transmission. Each cell
belonging to the same MBMS service area may be in any of three states.
With the variation of the number of UEs, the state of a cell may change
between the three states. UTRAN may broadcast the state of each cell.

1\) No Transmission: In this state of a cell, there is no established
radio bearer because there is no UE who wants to receive the service. An
MBMS-joined (or MBMS-interested in broadcast mode) UE in idle mode that
moves into the cell of this state requests service delivery to UTRAN.

2\) P-t-p Transmission: In this state of a cell, p-t-p radio bearer is
established. A UE that has joined (or interested in broadcast mode) an
MBMS service may receive MBMS data over p-t-p radio bearer if there is
MBMS data to receive.

3\) P-t-m Transmission: In this state of a cell, p-t-m radio bearer is
established. A UE that has joined (or interested in broadcast mode) an
MBMS service may receive MBMS data over p-t-m radio bearer if there is
MBMS data to receive.

A4 MBMS Phases and Status Parameters
====================================

Table 1 lists the MBMS parameters that need to be broadcast in each MBMS
phase. The list is \[FFS\]

Table 1: MBMS Status Parameters

  -------------------- --------- ------------ ---------------------- -----------------------------------------
                       Phase 1   Phase 2      Phase 3                Description
  Service ID           X         O            O                      Identity of the Service
  Transmission State   X         X            O (NONE/p-t-p/p-t-m)   State of the cell for MBMS transmission
  Counting             X         O (On/Off)   O (On/Off)             Whether counting procedure is going on.
  -------------------- --------- ------------ ---------------------- -----------------------------------------

1\) Service ID: This parameters indicates is the identity of the service
concerned.

2\) Transmission state: This parameter indicates to UE(s) the state of
the concerned cell while it is in phase 3. According to this parameter,
UE entering the cell starts re-configuration of the radio bearer, or
requests service delivery to UTRAN. Specifically, if this parameter is
set to \"p-t-m\", UE receives service over p-t-m radio bearer and if set
to \"p-t-p\", UE receives service over p-t-p radio bearer. If it is set
to NONE, UE has to request UTRAN to deliver the service.

3\) Counting: The counting parameter informs UEs whether counting is
required (and is going on) or not. If this parameter is set to \"ON\",
UE should perform RRC connection procedure.
