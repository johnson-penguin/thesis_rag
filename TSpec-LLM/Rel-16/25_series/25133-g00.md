can be found in \[3\] for UE FDD, in \[4\] for BS FDD, in \[5\] for UE
TDD, in \[6\] for BS TDD.

**Node B:**A logical node responsible for radio transmission / reception
in one or more cells to/from the User Equipment. Terminates the Iub
interface towards the RNC

**Power Spectral Density:** The units of Power Spectral Density (PSD)
are extensively used in this document. PSD is a function of power versus
frequency and when integrated across a given bandwidth, the function
represents the mean power in such a bandwidth. When the mean power is
normalised to (divided by) the chip-rate it represents the mean energy
per chip. Some signals are directly defined in terms of energy per chip,
(DPCH\_E~c~, E~c~, OCNS\_E~c~ and S-CCPCH\_E~c~) and others defined in
terms of PSD (I~o~, I~oc~, I~or~ and Î~or~). There also exist quantities
that are a ratio of energy per chip to PSD (DPCH\_E~c~/I~or~, E~c~/I~or~
etc.). This is the common practice of relating energy magnitudes in
communication systems.\
It can be seen that if both energy magnitudes in the ratio are divided
by time, the ratio is converted from an energy ratio to a power ratio,
which is more useful from a measurement point of view. It follows that
an energy per chip of X dBm/3,84 MHz can be expressed as a mean power
per chip of X dBm. Similarly, a signal PSD of Y dBm/3,84 MHz can be
expressed as a signal power of Y dBm.

**MBSFN cluster:** Set of cells operating in MBSFN mode providing only
MBMS service in PtM mode and seen as one cell by a UE.

**Adjacent Frequency:** A downlink frequency in the inter-frequency cell
info list that is within 5 MHz from the intra frequency. It is
explicitly indicated by UTRAN to UE via upper layer signaling.

**Primary uplink frequency**: If a single uplink frequency is configured
for the UE, then it is the primary uplink frequency. In case more than
one uplink frequency is configured for the UE, then the primary uplink
frequency is the frequency on which the E-DCH corresponding to the
serving E-DCH cell associated with the serving HS-DSCH cell is
transmitted. The association between a pair of uplink and downlink
frequencies is indicated by higher layers.

**Secondary uplink frequency**: A secondary uplink frequency is a
frequency on which an E-DCH corresponding to a serving E-DCH cell
associated with a secondary serving HS-DSCH cell is transmitted. The
association between a pair of uplink and downlink frequencies is
indicated by higher layers.

**Activated Uplink Frequency:** For a specific UE, an uplink frequency
is said to be activated if the UE is allowed to transmit on that
frequency. The primary uplink frequency is always activated when
configured while a secondary uplink frequency has to be activated by
means of an HS-SCCH order in order to become activated.

**Normal Performance Group:** For UE which supports Increased UE carrier
monitoring UTRA or E-UTRA, the group of inter-frequency carriers or
inter-RAT carriers is divided into two groups. The group which has a
better delay performance compared to the other group is refered to as
the normal performance group.

**Reduced Performance Group:** For UE which supports Increased UE
carrier monitoring UTRA or E-UTRA the group of inter-frequency carriers
or inter-RAT carriers is divided into two groups. The group which has
worse delay performance compared to the other group is refered to as the
reduced performance group.

**eDRX cycles:** eDRX cycles and associated parameters are defined in TS
24.008 \[32\].

3.4 Test tolerances
-------------------

The requirements given in the present document make no allowance for
measurement uncertainty. The test specification 34.121 and 25.141 define
test tolerances. These test tolerances are individually calculated for
each test. The test tolerances are then added to the limits in this
specification to create test limits. The measurement results are
compared against the test limits as defined by the shared risk
principle.

Shared Risk is defined in ETR 273 Part 1 sub-part 2 section 6.5.

3.5 Additional notation

4 Idle Mode Tasks
=================

4.1 Cell Selection
------------------

### 4.1.1 Introduction

After a UE has switched on and a PLMN has been selected, the Cell
selection process takes place, as described in TS25.304. This process
allows the UE to select a suitable cell where to camp on in order to
access available services. In this process the UE can use stored
information (*Stored information cell selection*) or not (*Initial cell
selection*).

4.2 Cell Re-selection
---------------------

### 4.2.1 Introduction

The cell reselection procedure allows the UE to select a more suitable
cell and camp on it.

When the UE is in either *Camped* *Normally* state or *Camped on Any
Cell* state on a FDD cell, the UE shall attempt to detect, synchronise,
and monitor intra-frequency, inter-frequency and inter-RAT cells
indicated in the measurement control system information of the serving
cell. UE measurement activity is also controlled by measurement rules
defined in TS25.304, allowing the UE to limit its measurement activity
if certain conditions are fulfilled.

### 4.2.2 Requirements

In the following sections, T~higher\_priority\_search~ is defined as (60
\* N~layers~) seconds when eDRX\_IDLE is not configured, and as MAX(one
eDRX\_IDLE cycle, 60 \* N~layers~) when eDRX\_IDLE is configured, where
N~layers~ is the total number of configured higher priority E-UTRA, UTRA
FDD and UTRA TDD carrier frequencies and is additionally increased by
one if one or more groups of GSM frequencies is configured as a higher
priority.

For a UE which supports increased carrier monitoring UTRA or increased
carrier monitoring E-UTRA, the reselection performance for different
carriers may be configured by higher layers to be either normal or
reduced. The following definitions are used in the performance
requirements:

> N~carrier~-1: Total number of FDD interfrequency carriers in the
> interfrequecny neighbour cell info list
>
> N~norm,inter~ = (N~carrier~-1- N~reduced,inter~): Number of FDD
> interfrequency carriers to be monitored with normal performance
>
> N~reduced,inter~: Number of FDD interfrequency carriers to be
> monitored with reduced performance
>
> K~carrier~: Total number of configured E-UTRA carriers in the
> neighbour cell list
>
> K~norm,E-UTRA~ =( K~carrier~ -- K~reduced,E-UTRA~): Number of E-UTRA
> carriers to be monitored with normal performance
>
> K~norm,E-UTRA,FDD~ : number of configured FDD E-UTRA carriers in the
> neighbour cell list to be monitored with normal performance
>
> K~norm,E-UTRA,TDD~ : number of configured TDD E-UTRA carriers in the
> neighbour cell list to be monitored with normal performance
>
> K~reduced,E-UTRA~: Number of E-UTRA carriers to be monitored with
> reduced performance

The minimum performance requirements for a UE which supports Increased
UE carrier monitoring UTRA \[16, 31\] are calculated as defined in
sections 4.2.2.3 provided that N~norm,inter~ ≤2 for FDD and
N~norm,inter~ ≤3 for TDD and the minimum performance requirements for a
UE which supports Increased UE carrier monitoring E-UTRA \[16, 31\] are
calculated as defined in sections 4.2.2.5a provided that
K~norm,E-UTRA~≤4 *for a UE capable of of either FDD E-UTRA carrier
monitoring or TDD E-UTRA carrier monitoring* or K~norm,E-UTRA~≤8 *for a
UE capable of both FDD and TDD E-UTRA carrier monitoring provided*
K~norm,E-UTRA,FDD~ ≤4 *and* K~norm,E-UTRA,TDD~ ≤4. In case the limits
for the number of normal performance carriers is exceeded, considering
the broadcast neighbour cell list and the bands supported by the UE, the
UE which supports Increased UE carrier monitoring UTRA shall measure the
first-listed 2 UTRA FDD carriers in the *Inter-frequency cell info list*
with normal performance and the UE capable of either FDD or TDD carrier
monitoring which supports Increased UE carrier monitoring E-UTRA shall
measure the first-listed 4 E-UTRA carriers, and a UE capable of both
FDD/TDD carrier monitoring the first-listed 4 FDD E-UTRA carriers and
first-listed 4 TDD E-UTRA carriers in *the Inter-RAT cell info list,*
with normal performance. Additionally, reduced performance requirements
shall be met for carriers for which the *Reduced measurement
performance* IE is indicated, up to the UE measurement capability in
section 4.2.2.8a.

The minimum performance requirements for a UE which does not support
Increased UE carrier monitoring UTRA \[16,31\] are calculated assuming
all UTRA carriers required to be monitored for such UE, are having
normal performance, i.e. N~norm,inter~ = N~carrier~-1 and
N~reduced,inter~ =0. The minimum performance requirements for a UE which
does not support Increased UE carrier monitoring E-UTRA \[16,31\] are
calculated assuming all E-UTRA carriers required to be monitored for
such UE, are having normal performance, i.e. K~norm,E-UTRA~ =
K~carrier~, and K~reduced,E-UTRA~ =0. Capabilities for number of
carriers to monitor for a UE which does not support Increased carrier
monitoring E-UTRA or Increased carrier monitoring UTRA are specified in
section 4.2.2.8.

#### 4.2.2.1 Measurement and evaluation of cell selection criteria S of serving cell

The UE shall, when eDRX\_IDLE is not configured or when eDRX\_IDLE cycle
is configured and eDRX\_IDLE cycle is below or equal to 20.48s, measure
the CPICH Ec/Io and CPICH RSCP level of the serving cell and evaluate
the cell selection criterion S defined in \[1\] for the serving cell at
least every DRX cycle. The UE shall filter the CPICH Ec/Io and CPICH
RSCP measurements of the serving cell using at least 2 measurements.
Within the set of measurements used for the filtering, at least two
measurements shall be spaced by, at least T~measureFDD~/2 (see table
4.1).

The UE shall, when eDRX\_IDLE is configured and eDRX\_IDLE cycle is
longer than 20.48s, measure the CPICH Ec/Io and CPICH RSCP level of the
serving cell and evaluate the cell selection criterion S defined in
\[1\] for the serving cell at least every DRX cycle within the PTW of
each eDRX\_IDLE cycle. The UE shall filter the CPICH Ec/Io and CPICH
RSCP measurements within the PTW of the serving cell using at least 2
measurements. Within the set of measurements used for the filtering, at
least two measurements shall be spaced by, at least half of the DRX
cycle length.

If the UE, when eDRX\_IDLE is not configured or when eDRX\_IDLE cycle is
configured and eDRX\_IDLE cycle is below or equal to 20.48s, has
evaluated in N~serv~ consecutive measured DRX cycles that the serving
cell does not fulfil the cell selection criterion S, the UE shall
initiate the measurements of all neighbour cells indicated in the
measurement control system information, regardless of the measurement
rules currently limiting UE measurement activities.

If the UE when eDRX\_IDLE is configured and eDRX\_IDLE cycle is longer
than 20.48s, has evaluated in MIN(N~serv,~
$\left\lceil \frac{\text{PTW}}{\text{DRX}_{\text{cycle}_{\text{length}}}} \right\rceil$)
consecutive measured DRX cycles that the serving cell does not fulfil
the cell selection criterion S, the UE shall initiate the measurements
of all neighbour cells indicated in the measurement control system
information, regardless of the measurement rules currently limiting UE
measurement activities.If the UE, independent on if eDRX\_IDLE is
configured or not, has not found any new suitable cell based on searches
and measurements of the neighbour cells indicated in the measurement
control system information for 12 s, the UE shall initiate cell
selection procedures for the selected PLMN as defined in \[1\].

After this 12 s period a UE in Cell:PCH or URA\_PCH is considered to be
\"out of service area\" and shall perform actions according to 25.331.

On transition from CELL\_DCH to CELL\_PCH/URA\_PCH, if a UE cannot find
a suitable UTRA cell, then it is considered to be \"out of service
area\" and shall perform actions according to \[16\].

If the S criterion of the serving cell is no longer fulfilled, the UE
may suspend MBMS reception if necessary to improve the UE's ability to
find a suitable cell.

If the S criterion of the serving cell is fulfilled, the measurement
requirements when a MBMS reception is active are specified in sections
4.2.2.2 and 4.2.2.9.

#### 4.2.2.2 Measurements of intra-frequency cells

The UE shall, when eDRX\_IDLE is not configured or when eDRX\_IDLE cycle
is configured and eDRX\_IDLE cycle is below or equal to 20.48s, measure
CPICH Ec/Io and CPICH RSCP at least every T~measureFDD~ (see table 4.1)
for intra-frequency cells that are identified and measured according to
the measurement rules. T~measureFDD~ is defined in Table 4.1. The UE
shall filter CPICH Ec/Io and CPICH RSCP measurements of each measured
intra-frequency cell using at least 2 measurements. Within the set of
measurements used for the filtering, at least two measurements shall be
spaced by at least T~measureFDD~/2.

The filtering shall in this case be such that the UE shall be capable of
evaluating that an intra-frequency cell has become better ranked than
the serving cell within T~evaluateFDD~ (see table 4.1), from the moment
the intra-frequency cell became at least 3 dB better ranked than the
current serving cell, provided that Treselection timer is set to zero
and either CPICH Ec/Io or CPICH RSCP is used as measurement quantity for
cell reselection. The UE shall when eDRX\_IDLE is configured and
eDRX\_IDLE cycle is longer than 20.48s, measure CPICH Ec/Io and CPICH
RSCP at least 2 times during the PTW every eDRX\_IDLE cycle for
intra-frequency cells that are identified and measured according to the
measurement rules. The UE shall filter CPICH Ec/Io and CPICH RSCP
measurements of each measured intra-frequency cell using at least 2
measurements from the same PTW. Within the set of measurements used for
the filtering, at least two measurements shall be spaced by at least
half the DRX cycle.

The filtering shall in this case be such that the UE shall be capable of
evaluating that an intra-frequency cell has become better ranked than
the serving cell within one eDRX\_IDLE cycle from the moment the
intra-frequency cell became at least 3 dB better ranked than the current
serving cell, provided that Treselection timer is set to zero and either
CPICH Ec/Io or CPICH RSCP is used as measurement quantity for cell
reselection.

If Treselection timer has a non zero value and the intra-frequency cell
is better ranked than the serving cell, the UE shall evaluate this
intra-frequency cell for the Treselection time. If this cell remains
better ranked within this duration, then the UE shall reselect that
cell.

If the UE is receiving the MTCH, the UE shall to be able to identify new
intra-frequency cells and take them into use for MTCH combining purposes
as defined in section 8.4.2.2.1

#### 4.2.2.3 Measurements of inter-frequency FDD cells

If priority information for UTRA FDD carrier frequencies is provided in
the measurement control systems information and Srxlev~ServingCell~ \>
S~prioritysearch1~ and Squal~ServingCell~ \> S~prioritysearch2~ then the
UE shall search for any higher priority UTRA inter-frequency cells at
least every T~higher\_priority\_search~ where
T~higher\_priority\_search~ is described in section 4.2.2. If the UE is
not in CELL\_PCH, URA\_PCH or IDLE state then the UE shall search for
UTRA FDD layers of higher priority within T~higher\_layer\_start~ upon
entering into any of these states. If 1 second has not elapsed since the
UE camped on the current serving cell when the UE enters into any of
these states, T~higher\_layer\_start~ is one DRX cycle plus 1 second;
otherwise T~higher\_layer\_start~ is one DRX cycle. If higher priority
UTRA cells are found by the higher priority search, they shall be
measured when eDRX\_IDLE is not configured or is configured with a
eDRX\_IDLE cycle less than or equal 20.48s at least every (N~carrier~-1)
\* T~measureFDD~. When eDRX\_IDLE is configured with a eDRX\_IDLE cycle
longer than 20.48s they shall be measured at least with two measurements
during the PTW in each eDRX\_IDLE cycle. If, after detecting a cell in a
higher priority search, it is determined that reselection has not
occurred then the UE is not required to continuously measure the
detected cell to evaluate the ongoing possibility of reselection.
However, the minimum measurement filtering requirements specified later
in this section shall still be met by the UE before it makes any
determination that it may stop measuring the cell. If priority
information for UTRA FDD carrier frequencies is provided in the
measurement control systems information and Srxlev~ServingCell~ \<=
S~prioritysearch1~ or Squal~ServingCell~ \<= S~prioritysearch2~, the
rules defined below apply irrespective of the priority of the
inter-frequency layer.

The UE shall, when eDRX\_IDLE is not configured or eDRX\_IDLE is
configured with a eDRX\_IDLE cycle less than or equal 20.48s, measure
CPICH Ec/Io and CPICH RSCP at least every N~norm,\ inter~ \*
T~measureFDD~ (see table 4.1) for the normal performance group carriers
and N~reduced,\ inter~ \* 6 \* T~measureFDD~ for the reduced performance
group carriers for inter-frequency cells that are identified and
measured according to the measurement rules. The parameter
N~norm,\ inter~ is the number of carriers in the normal performance
group and N~reduced,\ inter~ is the number of carriers in the reduced
performance group used for FDD cells as defined in section 4.2.2.The UE
shall filter CPICH Ec/Io and CPICH RSCP measurements of each measured
inter-frequency cell using at least 2 measurements. Within the set of
measurements used for the filtering, at least two measurements shall be
spaced by at least T~measureFDD~/2.

If CPICH Ec/Io is used as measurement quantity for cell reselection and
eDRX\_IDLE is not configured or eDRX\_IDLE is configured with a
eDRX\_IDLE cycle less than or equal 20.48s, the filtering shall be such
that the UE shall be capable of evaluating that an already identified
inter-frequency cell has met the reselection criteria in \[1\] within
N~norm,\ inter~ \* T~evaluateFDD~ (see table 4.1) for the normal
performance group carriers and N~reduced,\ inter~ \* 6 \* T~evaluateFDD~
for the reduced performance group carriers from the moment the
inter-frequency cell met the reselection criteria by at least 3 dB
provided that Treselection timer is set to zero. For non-identified
inter-frequency cells, the filtering shall be such that the UE shall be
capable of evaluating that inter-frequency cell belonging to the normal
performance group has met the reselection criteria in \[1\] within 30 s
and inter-frequency cell belonging to the reduced performance group has
met the reselection criteria in \[1\] within 180 s from the moment the
inter-frequency cell met the reselection criteria by at least 3 dB
provided that Treselection timer is set to zero.

If CPICH RSCP is used as measurement quantity for cell reselection and
eDRX\_IDLE is not configured or eDRX\_IDLE is configured with a
eDRX\_IDLE cycle less than or equal 20.48s, the filtering shall be such
that the UE shall be capable of evaluating that an already identified
inter-frequency cell has met the reselection criteria in \[1\] within
N~norm,\ inter~ \* T~evaluateFDD~ for the normal performance group
carriers and N~reduced,\ inter~ \* 6 \* T~evaluateFDD~ for the reduced
performance group carriers from the moment the inter-frequency cell met
the reselection criteria by at least 5 dB for reselection based on
ranking, or \[6\]dB for reselection based on absolute priorities
provided that Treselection timer is set to zero. For non-identified
inter-frequency cells, the filtering shall be such that the UE shall be
capable of evaluating that inter-frequency cell belonging to the normal
performance group has met the reselection criteria in \[1\] within 30 s
and inter-frequency cell belonging to the reduced performance group has
met the reselection criteria in \[1\] within 180 s from the moment the
inter-frequency cell met the reselection criteria by at least 5 dB for
reselection based on ranking, or \[6\]dB for reselection based on
absolute priorities provided that Treselection timer is set to zero.

The UE shall when eDRX\_IDLE is configured with a eDRX\_IDLE cycle
longer than 20.48s measure CPICH Ec/Io and CPICH RSCP at least two times
during the PTW period in every eDRX\_IDLE cycle length for the normal
performance group carriers for inter-frequency cells that are identified
and measured according to the measurement rules. For the reduced
performance group the UE shall, when Srxlev\<3 dB or Squal\<3 dB measure
CPICH Ec/Io and CPICH RSCP at least two times during the PTW cycle in
every DRX cycle length. The UE shall filter CPICH Ec/Io and CPICH RSCP
measurements of each measured inter-frequency cell using at least 2
measurements from the same PTW. Within the set of measurements used for
the filtering, at least two measurements shall be spaced by at least
half the DRX cycle length.

If CPICH Ec/Io is used as measurement quantity for cell reselection
reselection and eDRX\_IDLE is configured with a eDRX\_IDLE cycle longer
than 20.48s, the filtering shall be such that the UE shall be capable of
evaluating that an already identified inter-frequency cell has met the
reselection criteria in \[1\] within one eDRX\_IDLE cycle length for the
normal performance group carriers and if Srxlev\<3 dB or Squal\<3 dB one
eDRX\_IDLE cycle for the reduced performance group carriers from the
moment the inter-frequency cell met the reselection criteria by at least
3 dB provided that Treselection timer is set to zero. For non-identified
inter-frequency cells, the filtering shall be such that the UE shall be
capable of evaluating that inter-frequency cell belonging to the normal
performance group has met the reselection criteria in \[1\] within the
MAX(30s, 2\*eDRX\_IDLE cycle length) and inter-frequency cell belonging
to the reduced performance group when Srxlev\<3 dB or Squal\<3 dB has
met the reselection criteria in \[1\] within MAX(180s, 2\*eDRX\_IDLE
cycle length) from the moment the inter-frequency cell met the
reselection criteria by at least 3 dB provided that Treselection timer
is set to zero.

If CPICH RSCP is used as measurement quantity for cell reselection and
and eDRX\_IDLE is configured with a eDRX\_IDLE cycle longer than 20.48s,
the filtering shall be such that the UE shall be capable of evaluating
that an already identified inter-frequency cell has met the reselection
criteria in \[1\] within one eDRX\_IDLE cycle length for the normal
performance group carriers and if Srxlev\<3 dB or Squal\<3 dB one
eDRX\_IDLE cycle for the reduced performance group carriers from the
moment the inter-frequency cell met the reselection criteria by at least
5 dB for reselection based on ranking, or 6 dB for reselection based on
absolute priorities provided that Treselection timer is set to zero. For
non-identified inter-frequency cells, the filtering shall be such that
the UE shall be capable of evaluating that inter-frequency cell
belonging to the normal performance group has met the reselection
criteria in \[1\] within the MAX(30s,2\*eDRX\_IDLE cycle length) and
inter-frequency cell belonging to the reduced performance group and
Srxlev\<3 dB or Squal\<3 dB has met the reselection criteria in \[1\]
within MAX(180 s, 2\*eDRX\_IDLE cycle length) from the moment the
inter-frequency cell met the reselection criteria by at least 5 dB for
reselection based on ranking, or \[6\]dB for reselection based on
absolute priorities provided that Treselection timer is set to zero.

If Treselection timer has a non zero value and the inter-frequency cell
meets the reselection criteria in \[1\], the UE shall evaluate this
inter-frequency cell for the Treselection time. If this cell fulfils the
reselection criteria within this duration, then the UE shall reselect
that cell.

#### 4.2.2.4 Measurements of inter-frequency TDD cells {#measurements-of-inter-frequency-tdd-cells .list-paragraph}

The requirements in this section shall apply to UE supporting FDD and
TDD.

The UE shall, when eDRX\_IDLE is not configured or eDRX\_IDLE is
configured with a eDRX\_IDLE cycle less than or equal 20.48s, measure
P-CCPCH RSCP at least every N~carrierTDD~ \* T~measureTDD~ (see table
4.1) for inter-frequency TDD cells that are identified and measured
according to the measurement rules. The parameter N~carrierTDD~ is the
number of carriers used for inter-frequency TDD cells. The UE shall
filter P-CCPCH RSCP measurements of each measured inter-frequency TDD
cell using at least 2 measurements. Within the set of measurements used
for the filtering, at least two measurements shall be spaced by at least
T~measureTDD~/2.

The filtering of PCCPCH RSCP shall, when eDRX\_IDLE is not configured or
eDRX\_IDLE is configured with a eDRX\_IDLE cycle less than or equal
20.48s, be such that the UE shall be capable of evaluating that an
already identified inter-frequency TDD cell has become better ranked
than the serving cell within N~carrierTDD~\* T~evaluateTDD~ from the
moment the inter-frequency TDD cell became at least 5 dB better ranked
than the current serving cell provided that Treselection timer is set to
zero. For non-identified inter-frequency TDD cells, the filtering shall
be such that the UE shall be capable of evaluating that an
inter-frequency TDD cell has become better ranked than the serving cell
within 30 s from the moment the inter-frequency TDD cell became at least
5 dB better ranked than the current serving cell provided that
Treselection timer is set to zero.

The UE shall, when eDRX\_IDLE is configured with a eDRX\_IDLE cycle
longer than 20.48s, measure P-CCPCH RSCP at least two times during the
PTW in every eDRX\_IDLE cycle length for inter-frequency TDD cells that
are identified and measured according to the measurement rules. The UE
shall filter P-CCPCH RSCP measurements of each measured inter-frequency
TDD cell using at least 2 measurements from the same PTW. Within the set
of measurements used for the filtering, at least two measurements shall
be spaced by at least half the DRX cycle length.

The filtering of PCCPCH RSCP shall when eDRX\_IDLE is configured with a
eDRX cycle longer than 20.48s be such that the UE shall be capable of
evaluating that an already identified inter-frequency TDD cell has
become better ranked than the serving cell within one eDRX\_IDLE cycle
length from the moment the inter-frequency TDD cell became at least 5 dB
better ranked than the current serving cell provided that Treselection
timer is set to zero. For non-identified inter-frequency TDD cells, the
filtering shall be such that the UE shall be capable of evaluating that
an inter-frequency TDD cell has become better ranked than the serving
cell within the minimum of 30s and two times the eDRX\_IDLE cycle length
from the moment the inter-frequency TDD cell became at least 5 dB better
ranked than the current serving cell provided that Treselection timer is
set to zero.

If Treselection timer has a non zero value and the inter-frequency TDD
cell is better ranked than the serving cell, the UE shall evaluate this
inter-frequency TDD cell for the Treselection time. If this cell remains
better ranked within this duration, then the UE shall reselect that
cell.

##### 4.2.2.5 Measurements of inter-RAT GSM cells

##### 4.2.2.5.1 Cell reselection based on cell ranking

The requirements in this subclause shall apply if the UE uses the cell
ranking algorithm for inter-RAT cell reselection \[1\].

The UE shall, when eDRX\_IDLE is not configured or eDRX is configured
with a eDRX\_IDLE cycle less than or equal 20.48s, measure the signal
level of the GSM BCCH carrier of each GSM neighbour cell indicated in
the measurement control system information of the serving cell,
according to the measurement rules defined in \[1\], at least every
T~measureGSM~ (see table 4.1). The UE shall maintain a running average
of 4 measurements for each GSM BCCH carrier. The measurement samples for
each cell shall be as far as possible uniformly distributed over the
averaging period.

The UE shall, when eDRX\_IDLE is configured with a eDRX\_IDLE cycle
longer than 20.48s, measure the signal level of the GSM BCCH carrier of
each GSM neighbour cell indicated in the measurement control system
information of the serving cell, according to the measurement rules
defined in \[1\], at least two times every eDRX\_IDLE cycle length. The
UE shall in the PTW in every eDRX\_IDLE cycle calculate an average of 4
measurement samples for each GSM BCCH carrier. The measurement samples
for each cell shall as far as possible be uniformly distributed over the
averaging period.

If GSM measurements are required by the measurement rules in \[1\], the
UE shall attempt to verify the BSIC at least every MAX(30 seconds,
eDRX\_IDLE cycle length) for each of the 4 strongest GSM BCCH carriers
and rank the verified GSM BCCH cells according to the cell reselection
criteria defined in \[1\]. If a change of BSIC is detected for one GSM
cell then that GSM BCCH carrier shall be treated as a new GSM neighbour
cell.

If the UE detects a BSIC, which is not indicated in the measurement
control system information, the UE shall not consider that GSM BCCH
carrier in cell reselection. The UE also shall not consider the GSM BCCH
carrier in cell reselection, if the UE cannot demodulate the BSIC of
that GSM BCCH carrier.

If Treselection timer has a non zero value and the inter-RAT GSM cell is
better ranked than the serving cell, the UE shall evaluate this
inter-RAT GSM cell for the Treselection time. If this cell remains
better ranked within this duration, then the UE shall reselect that
cell.

##### 4.2.2.5.2 Cell reselection based on priority information

The requirements in this subclause shall apply if the UE uses the
absolute priorities based algorithm for inter-RAT cell reselection
\[1\].

If Srxlev~ServingCell~ \> S~prioritysearch1~ and Squal~ServingCell~ \>
S~prioritysearch2~ then the UE shall search for and measure GSM cells if
the priority of GSM is higher than the serving cell. The minimum rate at
which the UE is required to search for and measure such layers may be
reduced in this scenario to maintain UE battery life.

When the measurement rules defined in \[1\] indicate that inter-RAT
cells are to be measured then the UE shall measure, the signal level of
the GSM BCCH carriers if the GSM BCCH carriers are indicated in the
measurement control system information of the serving cell. GSM BCCH
carriers of lower priority than the serving cell shall when
eDRX\_IDLE\_IDLE is not configured or eDRX\_IDLE is configured with a
eDRX\_IDLE cycle less than or equal 20.48s be measured at least every
T~measure,GSM~ (see table 4.1). When eDRX\_IDLE is configured with a
eDRX\_IDLE cycle longer than 20.48s serving cell shall be measured at
least 4 times during the PTW within every eDRX\_IDLE cycle length.

If Srxlev~ServingCell~ \> S~prioritysearch1~ and Squal~ServingCell~ \>
S~prioritysearch2~ then the UE shall search for GSM BCCH carrier at
least every T~higher\_priority\_search~ where
T~higher\_priority\_search~ is described in section 4.2.2. If the UE is
not in CELL\_PCH, URA\_PCH or IDLE state then the UE shall search for
GSM layers of higher priority within T~higher\_layer\_start~ upon
entering into any of these states. If 1 second has not elapsed since the
UE camped on the current serving cell when the UE enters into any of
these states, T~higher\_layer\_start~ is one DRX cycle plus 1 second;
otherwise T~higher\_layer\_start~ is one DRX cycle. When higher priority
GSM BCCH carriers are found by the higher priority search when
eDRX\_IDLE is not configured or eDRX\_IDLE is configured with a
eDRX\_IDLE cycle less than or equal 20.48s, they shall be measured at
least every T~measure,GSM,~ and the UE shall decode the BSIC of the GSM
BCCH carrier. When eDRX\_IDLE is configured with a eDRX\_IDLE cycle
longer than 20.48s, they shall be measured at least 4 times during the
PTW in every eDRX\_IDLE cycle length~,~ and the UE shall decode the BSIC
of the GSM BCCH carrier.

If, after detecting a cell in a higher priority search, it is determined
that reselection has not occurred then the UE is not required to
continuously measure the detected cell to evaluate the ongoing
possibility of reselection to continuously verify the BSIC of the GSM
BCCH carrier every MIN(30s, eDRX\_IDLE cycle length). However, the
minimum measurement filtering requirements specified later in this
section shall still be met by the UE before it makes any determination
that it may stop measuring the cell. If Srxlev~ServingCel**l**~ \<=
S~prioritysearch1~ or Squal~ServingCell~ \<= S~prioritysearch2~, the
rules defined below apply irrespective of the priority of the GSM layer.

The UE shall when eDRX\_IDLE is not configured or eDRX\_IDLE is
configured with a eDRX\_IDLE cycle less than or equal 20.48s maintain a
running average of 4 measurements for each GSM BCCH carrier. The
measurement samples for each cell shall be as far as possible uniformly
distributed over the averaging period. The UE shall when eDRX\_IDLE is
configured with a eDRX\_IDLE cycle longer than 20.48s every eDRX\_IDLE
cycle length measure and average of 4 measurements for each GSM BCCH
carrier. The measurement samples for each cell shall be as far as
possible uniformly distributed over the averaging period.

If continuous GSM measurements are required by the measurement rules in
\[1\], the UE shall attempt to verify the BSIC at least every MIN(30
seconds, eDRX\_IDLE cycle length) for each of the 4 strongest GSM BCCH
carriers. If a change of BSIC is detected for one GSM cell then that GSM
BCCH carrier shall be treated as a new GSM neighbour cell. If the UE
detects on a BCCH carrier a BSIC which is indicated as not allowed for
that carrier in the measurement control system information of the
serving cell, the UE is not required to perform BSIC re-confirmation for
that cell.

The UE shall not consider the GSM BCCH carrier in cell reselection, if
the UE cannot demodulate the BSIC of that GSM BCCH carrier.
Additionally, the UE shall not consider a GSM neighbour cell in cell
reselection, if it is indicated as not allowed in the measurement
control system information of the serving cell.

#### 4.2.2.5a Measurements of inter-RAT E-UTRA cells

The UE shall be able to identify new E-UTRA cells and perform RSRP and
RSRQ measurements of identified E-UTRA cells if carrier frequency
information is provided by the serving cell, even if no explicit
neighbour list with physical layer cell identities is provided.

If Srxlev~ServingCell~ \> S~prioritysearch1~ and Squal~ServingCell~ \>
S~prioritysearch2~ then the UE shall search for E-UTRA layers of higher
priority at least every T~higher\_priority\_search~ where
T~higher\_priority\_search~ is described in section 4.2.2. If the UE is
not in CELL\_PCH, URA\_PCH or IDLE state then the UE shall search for
E-UTRA layers of higher priority within T~higher\_layer\_start~ upon
entering into any of these states. If 1 second has not elapsed since the
UE camped on the current serving cell when the UE enters into any of
these states, T~higher\_layer\_start~ is one DRX cycle plus 1 second;
otherwise T~higher\_layer\_start~ is one DRX cycle. The minimum rate at
which the UE is required to search for and measure such layers may be
reduced in this scenario to maintain UE battery life.

If Srxlev~ServingCell~ \<= S~prioritysearch1~ or Squal~ServingCell~ \<=
S~prioritysearch2~ then the UE shall search for and measure E-UTRA
frequency layers of higher or lower priority in preparation for possible
reselection. In this scenario, the minimum rate at which the UE is
required to search for and measure higher priority layers shall be the
same as that defined below for a lower priority layers.

The UE shall, when eDRX\_IDLE is not configured or eDRX\_IDLE is
configured with a eDRX\_IDLE cycle less than or equal 20.48s, be able to
evaluate whether a new detectable lower priority inter-RAT E-UTRA cell
meets the reselection criteria defined in \[1\] within K~norm,\ EUTRA~
\* T~detectE-UTRA~ for the normal performance group and
K~reduced,\ EUTRA~ \* 6 \* T~detectE-UTRA~ for the reduced performance
group, where T~detectE-UTRA~ is given in Table 4.2, if E-UTRA carrier
frequency information is provided in the inter-RAT measurement control
system information when Treselection=0 provided that the reselection
criteria is met by at least 6dB for RSRP reselections or 4dB for RSRQ
reselections. The parameter K~norm,\ EUTRA~ is the number of E-UTRA
carrier frequencies in the normal performance group and the parameter
K~reduced,\ EUTRA~ is the number of E-UTRA carrier frequencies in the
reduced performance group indicated in the inter-RAT measurement control
system information as defined in section 4.2.2. An inter RAT E-UTRAN
cell is considered to be detectable if:

> \- RSRP\|~dBm~ according to Annex B.1.1 for a corresponding Band

The UE shall measure RSRP and RSRQ at least every K~norm,\ EUTRA~ \*
T~measureE-UTRA~ for normal performance group and K~reduced,\ EUTRA~ \*
6 \* T~measureE-UTRA~ for reduced performance group as defined in table
4.2 for identified E-UTRA cells.

The UE shall when eDRX\_IDLE is configured with a eDRX\_IDLE cycle
longer than 20.48s for the normal performance group and if Srxlev\<3 dB
or Squal\<3 dB for the reduced performance group be able to evaluate
whether a new detectable lower priority inter-RAT E-UTRA cell meets the
reselection criteria defined in \[1\] within the PTW in every eDRX\_IDLE
cycle length if E-UTRA carrier frequency information is provided in the
inter-RAT measurement control system information when Treselection=0
provided that the reselection criteria is met by at least 6dB for RSRP
reselections or 4dB for RSRQ reselections. An inter RAT E-UTRAN cell is
considered to be detectable when eDRX\_IDLE is configured with a
eDRX\_IDLE cycle longer than 20.48s if:

> \- RSRP\|~dBm~ according to Annex B.1.1 for a corresponding Band

The UE shall measure RSRP and RSRQ at least 2 times every eDRX\_IDLE
cycle time for normal performance group and if Srxlev\<3 dB or Squal\<3
dB for reduced performance group.

When higher priority cells are found by the higher priority search when
eDRX\_IDLE is not configured or eDRX is configured with a eDRX\_IDLE
cycle less than or equal 20.48s, they shall be measured at least every
T~measureE-UTRA~. When higher priority cells are found by the higher
priority search when eDRX\_IDLE is configured with a eDRX\_IDLE cycle
longer than 20.48s, they shall be measured at least two times during the
PTW in every eDRX\_IDLE cycle time. If, after detecting a cell in a
higher priority search, it is determined that reselection has not
occurred then the UE is not required to continuously measure the
detected cell to evaluate the ongoing possibility of reselection.
However, the minimum measurement filtering requirements specified later
in this section shall still be met by the UE before it makes any
determination that it may stop measuring the cell. If the UE detects on
a E-UTRA carrier a cell whose physical identity is indicated as not
allowed for that carrier in the measurement control system information
of the serving cell, the UE is not required to perform measurements on
that cell.

If the UE detects on a E-UTRA carrier a cell whose physical identity is
indicated as not allowed for that carrier in the measurement control
system information of the serving cell, the UE is not required to
perform measurements on that cell.

The UE shall filter RSRP and RSRQ measurements of each measured E-UTRA
cell using at least 2 measurements. Within the set of measurements used
for the filtering when eDRX\_IDLE is not configured or eDRX\_IDLE is
configured with a eDRX\_IDLE cycle less than or equal 20.48s, at least
two measurements shall be spaced by at least T~measureE-UTRA~/2. When
eDRX\_IDLE is configured with a eDRX\_IDLE cycle longer than 20.48s the
UE shall filter RSRP and RSRQ measurements of each measured E-UTRA cell
using at least 2 measurements from the PTW within a eDRX\_IDLE cycle
length. Within this set of measurements used for the filtering, at least
two measurements shall be spaced by at least half the DRX cycle.

RSRP and RSRQ measurements of E-UTRA cells shall not be filtered over a
longer period than that specified in Table 4.2.

The UE shall not consider an E-UTRA neighbour cell in cell reselection,
if it is indicated as not allowed in the measurement control system
information of the serving cell.

For an inter-RAT E-UTRA cell that has been already detected, but that
has not been reselected to, the filtering shall be such that the UE
shall when eDRX\_IDLE is not configured or eDRX\_IDLE is configured with
a eDRX\_IDLE cycle less than or equal 20.48s be capable of evaluating
that the E-UTRA cell has met reselection criterion defined TS 36.304
within K~norm,\ EUTRA~ \* T~evaluateEUTRA~ for normal performance group
and K~reduced,\ EUTRA~ \* 6 \* T~evaluateE-UTRA~ for reduced performance
group as specified in table 4.2 provided that the reselection criteria
is met by at least 6dB for RSRP reselections or 4dB for RSRQ
reselections and the Treselection timer is set to zero. When eDRX\_IDLE
is configured with a eDRX\_IDLE cycle longer than 20.48s the filtering
shall be such that the UE shall be capable of evaluating that the E-UTRA
cell has met reselection criterion defined TS 36.304 within one
eDRX\_IDLE cycle length for normal performance group and for reduced
performance group when Srxlev\<3 dB or Squal\<3 dB provided that the
reselection criteria is met by at least 6dB for RSRP reselections or 4dB
for RSRQ reselections and the Treselection timer is set to zero.

#### 4.2.2.6 Evaluation of cell re-selection criteria

The UE shall evaluate the cell re-selection criteria defined in TS
25.304 for the cells, which have new measurement results available, at
least every DRX cycle.

UE shall perform cell reselection immediately after the reselection
criteria have been met (e.g. the UE has found a higher ranked suitable
cell or the UE has found a suitable cell on a higher priority RAT),
unless less than 1 second has elapsed from the moment the UE started
camping on the serving cell. The ranking of the cells shall be made
according to the cell reselection criteria specified in TS25.304.

#### 4.2.2.7 Maximum interruption in paging reception

UE shall perform the cell re-selection with minimum interruption in
monitoring downlink channels for paging reception.

At intra-frequency cell re-selection, the UE shall monitor the downlink
of serving cell for paging reception until the UE is capable to start
monitoring downlink channels of the target intra-frequency cell for
paging reception. The interruption time shall not exceed 50 ms.

At inter-frequency and inter-RAT cell re-selection, the UE shall monitor
the downlink of serving cell for paging reception until the UE is
capable to start monitoring downlink channels for paging reception of
the target inter-frequency cell. For inter-frequency cell re-selection
the interruption time must not exceed - T~SI~ + 50 ms. For inter-RAT
cell re-selection the interruption time must not exceed T~BCCH~ + 50 ms
for GSM or T~SI-EUTRA~ + \[50 ms\] for E-UTRA.

T~SI~ is the time required for receiving all the relevant system
information data according to the reception procedure and the RRC
procedure delay of system information blocks defined in 25.331 for a
UTRAN cell.

T~BCCH~ is the maximum time allowed to read BCCH data from a GSM cell
\[21\].

T~SI-EUTRA~ is the maximum time allowed to read system information from
a E-UTRA cell \[24\].

These requirements assume sufficient radio conditions, so that decoding
of system information can be made without errors and does not take into
account cell re-selection failure.

For higher priority cells, a UE may optionally use a shorter value for
TmeasureFDD and TmeasureE-UTRA ,which shall not be less than Max(0.64 s,
one DRX cycle).

In idle mode, UE shall support DRX cycles lengths 0.64, 1.28, 2.56 and
5.12 s, according to \[16\] and UE shall, if it supports eDRX\_IDLE,
support eDRX\_IDLE cycle lengths 10.24, 20.48, 40.96, 81.92, 163.84,
327.68, 655.36,1310.72, 1966.08 and 2621.44 seconds, according to TS
24.008 \[32\].

#### 4.2.2.8 Number of cells in cell lists

For idle mode cell re-selection purposes, the UE shall be capable of
monitoring:

\- 32 intra-frequency cells (including serving cell), and

\- 32 inter-frequency cells, including

\- FDD cells on maximum 2 additional carriers, and

\- Depending on UE capability, TDD cells distributed on up to 3 TDD
carriers, and

\- Depending on UE capability, 32 GSM cells distributed on up to 32 GSM
carriers, and

\- Depending on UE capability, up to 4 E-UTRA FDD carriers, and

\- Depending on UE capability up to 4 E-UTRA TDD carriers

as indicated in cell information lists sent in system information
(BCCH).

*In addition to the requirements defined above, a UE supporting E-UTRA
measurements in RRC\_IDLE state shall be capable of monitoring a minimum
total of at least 8 carrier frequency layers, including the
intra-frequency serving layer and comprising of any* above defined
*combination of E-UTRA FDD, E-UTRA TDD, UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD and GSM
layers (one GSM layer corresponds to 32 cells).*

#### 4.2.2.8a Number of cells in cell lists (Increased UE carrier monitoring)

UE which supports Increased UE carrier monitoring UTRA according to
capabilities in \[16,31\] shall be capable of monitoring at least

80 inter-frequency cells, including

\- 5 FDD UTRA inter-frequency carriers with up to 32 cells per carrier.

UE which supports increased UE carrier monitoring E-UTRA according to
capabilities in \[16,31\] shall be capable of monitoring at least

\- Depending on UE capability, 8 FDD E-UTRA carriers, and

\- Depending on UE capability, 8 TDD E-UTRA carriers, and

*In addition to the requirements defined above,* a UE supporting E-UTRA
measurements in RRC\_IDLE state and supporting Increased UE carrier
monitoring UTRA or increased UE carrier monitoring E-UTRA according to
capabilities in \[16,31\] shall be capable of monitoring a total of at
least 13 carrier frequency layers, which includes serving layer,
comprising of any above defined combination of *of E-UTRA FDD, E-UTRA
TDD, UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD and GSM layers (one GSM layer corresponds to 32
cells)*.

#### 4.2.2.9 Additional requirements for measurement of inter-frequency and inter-RAT cells when MBMS reception is active 

If an MBMS service is being received then the following requirements
additionally apply:

When the UE is receiving MTCH and the UE evaluates that the cell
re-selection measurement rules in 25.304 indicate that inter-frequency
or inter-RAT measurements are not required to be made, the UE shall not
perform the corresponding inter-frequency or inter-RAT measurements.

When the UE is receiving MTCH and the UE evaluates that the cell
re-selection measurement rules in 25.304 indicate that inter-frequency
or inter-RAT measurements are required to be made, and the UE needs to
interrupt MTCH reception to make inter-frequency or inter-RAT
measurements, an individual interruption of MTCH reception shall not
exceed 12.5% of an MTCH TTI from a single arbitrary cell from which the
MTCH is received.

The total interruption time to the MTCH reception due to inter-frequency
measurements shall not exceed a total of

\- 20 ms every Tmeasure, FDD for measuring known FDD inter-frequency
neighbours, and

\- 300 ms every 30 seconds for searching for new FDD inter-frequency
cells for each inter-frequency carrier frequency

There are no corresponding limitations on the total interruption time to
the MTCH reception due to inter-RAT measurements

The UE shall ensure that inter-frequency measurement or inter-RAT
measurement interruptions do not overlap constantly with the periodic
MCCH transmissions.

#### 4.2.2.10 MTCH Interruption time

The MTCH interruption time is the time between the end of the last MTCH
TTI on which UE receives MTCH from the serving cell and the beginning of
the first MTCH TTI on which UE starts receiving MTCH from the target
cell.

The MTCH interruption time due to intra-frequency cell reselection
without soft combining during an MBMS session shall be less than
T~MTCH\_interrupt~

T~MTCH\_interrupt~ = T~IU~+20 +T~MCCH~+T~MTCH~ ms

Where

TMCCH: is the time required to read the relevant MCCH information of the
target cell according to the MBMS specific procedures defined in TS
25.331.

TMTCH: is the uncertainty when reading the MTCH of the serving and
target cells while performing cell reselection; TMTCCH can be up to 2
MTCH TTI.

The MTCH interruption time (T~MTCH\_interrupt~) shall be applicable when
UE is receiving MBMS in idle mode, CELL\_PCH state and URA\_PCH state.

#### 4.2.2.11 Reselection to CSG cells

Note: Requirements in this section are minimum requirements defined to
ensure the testability of autonomous CSG search.

Reselection from non CSG to CSG cells may be performed using UE
autonomous search as defined in \[1\] when at least one CSG ID is
included in the UE's **CSG** white**list**. The requirements in this
section are valid for reselection to CSG cells previously visited by the
UE when the radio configuration parameters, including the carrier
frequency and physical cell identity of the CSG cell, non CSG cell and
other neighbour cells are unchanged from the most recent previous visit.

NOTE: According to \[1\], the UE autonomous search function, per UE
implementation, determines when and/or where to search for allowed CSG
cells.

##### 4.2.2.11.1 Reselection from a non CSG to an inter-frequency CSG cell

The UE shall perform search and reselection to an allowed
inter-frequency CSG cell that has met CSG reselection criterion defined
in \[1\] and that is in its whitelist, within 6 minutes in the
conditions shown in table 4.2.2.11.1-1. There is no need for statistical
testing of this requirement.

+----------------+--------------+----------------+----------------+

4.3 MBSFN cluster selection
---------------------------

### 4.3.1 Introduction

MBSFN allows the UE to select a suitable MBSFN cluster where to camp on
in order to access available services.

4.4 MBSFN cluster reselection
-----------------------------

### 4.4.1 Introduction

There are no requirements specified for MBSFN cluster reselection.

4.5 Minimization of Drive Tests (MDT)
-------------------------------------

UE supporting minimisation of drive tests shall be capable of, 3GPP TS
25.331 \[16\]:

\- logging measurements in RRC\_IDLE, CELL\_PCH, and URA\_PCH states,
reporting the logged measurements and meeting requirements in this
section.

\- logging of RRC connection establishment failure, reporting the logged
failure and meeting requirements in this section.

### 4.5.1 Introduction

The loggeed MDT requirements consist of measurement requirements as
specified in section 4.5.2 and relative time stamp accuracy requirements
as specified in section 4.5.3. Both sets of requirements are applicable
for intra-frequency, inter-frequency and inter-RAT cases in idle,
CELL\_PCH and URA\_PCH states. The MDT procedures are described in 3GPP
TS 37.320 \[26\].

For RRC connection establishment failure logging and reporting, the MDT
requirements consist of requirements for measurements performed and
logged in IDLE, CELL\_PCH, and URA\_PCH states specified in Section
4.5.2 and relative time stamp accuracy requirement for RRC connection
establishment failure log reporting as specified in Section 4.5.4.

### 4.5.2 Measurements 

The requirements specified in this section apply for the measurements
(GSM carrier RSSI, UTRA CPICH RSCP, UTRA CPICH Ec/Io, P-CCPCH RSCP for
UTRA 1.28 TDD , E-UTRA RSRP and E-UTRA RSRQ) performed and logged by the
UE for MDT in IDLE, CELL\_PCH and URA\_PCH states. The requirements
apply for the measurements included in logged MDT reports and RRC
connection establishment failure reports.

#### 4.5.2.1 Requirements

The measurement values that are used to meet serving cell and
reselection requirements as specified in sections 4.2.2.1, 4.2.2.2,
4.2.2.3, 4.2.2.4, 4.2.2.5 and 4.2.2.5a shall also apply to the values
logged for MDT measurements in idle state.

The measurement values that are used to meet serving cell and
reselection requirements as specified in section 5.6 shall also apply to
the values logged for MDT measurements in CELL\_PCH state.

The measurement values that are used to meet serving cell and
reselectionrequirements as specified in section 5.7 shall also apply for
the values logged for MDT measurements in URA\_PCH state.

### 4.5.3 Relative Time Stamp Accuracy

The relative time stamp for a logged measurement is defined as the time
from the moment the MDT configuration was received at the UE until the
measurement was logged, see \[16\].

#### 4.5.3.1 Requirements

The accuracy of the relative time stamping is such that the drift of the
time stamping shall be not more than ±2 seconds per hour.

### 4.5.4 Relative Time Stamp Accuracy for RRC Connection Establishment Failure Log Reporting

Relative time stamp for RRC connection establishment failure log
reporting is defined as the time elapsed from the last RRC connection
establishment failure to the time when the log is included in the report
\[16\]. The UE shall report the RRC connection establishment failure
log, while meeting the accuracy requirement specified in Section
4.5.4.1.

#### 4.5.4.1 Requirements

The accuracy of the relative time stamping for RRC connection
establishment failure log reporting is such that the drift of the time
stamping shall not be larger than ± 0.72 seconds per hour and ± 10
seconds over 48 hours. The relative time stamp accuracy requirements
shall apply provided that:

\- no switch off or detach occurs after the RRC connection establishment
failure had been detected and until the log is time-stamped.

NOTE: This requirement does not need to be tested.

5 UTRAN Connected mode mobility
===============================

This section contains the requirements on the mobility procedures in
UTRAN connected mode such as handover and cell re-selection.

Requirements related to the measurements in support of the execution of
the UTRAN connected mode mobility procedures are specified, currently
not necessarily for all UTRAN connected mode states, in section 8 .

The radio links the UE shall use are controlled by UTRAN with RRC
signalling.

UE behaviour in response to UTRAN RRC messages is described in TS25.331.

The purpose of Cell reselection in CELL\_FACH, CELL\_PCH and URA\_PCH
states is that the UE shall select a better cell according to the cell
reselection criteria in TS 25.304. CELL\_FACH, CELL\_PCH and URA\_PCH
states are described in TS 25.331.

5.1 FDD/FDD Soft Handover
-------------------------

### 5.1.1 Introduction

Soft handover is a function in which the UE is connected to several
UTRAN access points at the same time. Addition and/or release of radio
links are controlled by the ACTIVE SET UPDATE procedure.

The soft handover function includes a measurement phase, a decision
algorithm in UTRAN and the ACTIVE SET UPDATE procedure.

### 5.1.2 Requirements

#### 5.1.2.1 Active set dimension

When the UE is configured with a single uplink carrier frequency, the UE
shall be capable of supporting at least 6 radio links in the active set.
For E-DCH the UE shall be capable of supporting a sub-set of the 6 radio
links in the active set. The subset shall consist of the Serving E-DCH
radio link and up to 3 additional E-DCH radio links. The 3 additional
radio links can either be from the Serving E-DCH radio link set or can
be Non-Serving radio links. The Serving E-DCH radio link, the Serving
E-DCH radio link set and Non-Serving E-DCH radio links are defined in
\[15\].

When the UE is configured with dual uplink carrier frequencies, the UE
shall be capable of supporting at least 4 radio links per uplink carrier
frequency. For E-DCH the UE shall be capable of supporting a sub-set of
the 4 radio links in the active set per uplink carrier frequency. The
subset shall consist of the Serving E-DCH radio link and up to 3
additional E-DCH radio links per uplink carrier frequency. The 3
additional radio links can either be from the Serving E-DCH radio link
set or can be Non-Serving radio links on the same uplink carrier
frequency.

#### 5.1.2.2 Active set update delay

The active set update delay is defined as the time from when the UE has
received the ACTIVE SET UPDATE message from UTRAN, or at the time stated
through the activation time when to perform the active set update, to
the time when the UE successfully uses the set of radio links stated in
that message for power control.

The active set update delay is depending on the number of known cells
referred to in the ACTIVE SET UPDATE message. A cell is known if it has
been measured by the UE during the last 5 seconds and the SFN of the
cell has been decoded by the UE.

And the phase reference is the primary CPICH.

The active set update delay shall be less than 50+10\*KC+100\*OC ms,
where

KC: is the number of known cells in the active set update message;

OC: is the number of cells that are not known in the active set update
message.

If the UE have radio links in the active set that it can not use for
data detection (due to low signal level), the UE shall at least every
150 ms search for the radio link

#### 5.1.2.3 Interruption Time

The UE shall not interrupt the data flow when adding, changing or
removing radio links to the active set.

5.2 FDD/FDD Hard Handover
-------------------------

### 5.2.1 Introduction

The hard handover procedure is initiated from UTRAN with a RRC message
that implies a hard handover, see TS 25.331 section 8.3.5.

### 5.2.2 Requirements

#### 5.2.2.1 Hard handover delay

Procedure delay for all procedures, that can command a hard handover,
are specified in TS25.331 section 13.5.2.

When the UE receives a RRC message implying hard handover with the
activation time \"now\" or earlier than RRC procedure delay seconds from
the end of the last TTI containing the RRC command, the UE shall be
ready to start the transmission of the new uplink DPCCH within
D~handover~ seconds from the end of the last TTI containing the RRC
command.

If the access is delayed to an indicated activation time later than RRC
procedure delay seconds from the end of the last TTI containing the RRC
command, the UE shall be ready to start the transmission of the new
uplink DPCCH at the designated activation time + interruption time.

where:

\- D~handover~ equals the RRC procedure delay defined in TS25.331
Section 13.5.2 plus the interruption time stated in section 5.2.2.2.

#### 5.2.2.2 Interruption time

The interruption time, i.e. the time between the last TTI containing a
transport block on the old DPDCH and the time the UE starts transmission
of the new uplink DPCCH, is depending on whether the target cell is
known for the UE or not.

If intra-frequency hard handover is commanded or inter-frequency hard
handover is commanded when the UE does not need compressed mode to
perform inter-frequency measurements, and if higher layers do not
indicate that the UE shall not perform any synchronisation procedure for
timing maintained intra- or inter-frequency hard handover, the
interruption time shall be less than Tinterrupt1

Tinterrupt1=T~IU~+T~sync~+20\*KC+150\*OC + 10\*F~max~ ms

where

T~IU~ is the interruption uncertainty when changing the timing from the
old to the new cell. T~IU~ can be up to one frame (10 ms).

KC is the number of known target cells in the message, and

OC is the number of target cells that are not known in the message.

F~max~ denotes the maximum number of radio frames within the
transmission time intervals of all transport channels that are
multiplexed into the same CCTrCH.

T~sync~ is the time required for measuring the downlink DPCCH channel as
stated in TS 25.214 section 4.3.1.2. In case higher layers indicate the
usage of a post-verification period T~sync~=0 ms. Otherwise T~sync~=40
ms.

In the interruption requirement Tinterrupt1 a cell is known if it has
been measured by the UE during the last 5 seconds and the SFN of the
cell has been decoded by the UE.

If inter-frequency hard handover is commanded and the UE needs
compressed mode to perform inter-frequency measurements and if higher
layers do not indicate that the UE shall not perform any synchronisation
procedure for timing maintained intra- or inter-frequency hard handover,
the interruption time shall be less than Tinterrupt2

Tinterrupt2 = T~IU~+T~sync~+50\*KC+150\*OC + 10\*F~max~ ms

In the interruption requirement Tinterrupt2 a cell is known if the cell
has been measured by the UE during the last 5 seconds.

If intra-frequency hard handover is commanded or if inter-frequency hard
handover is commanded when the UE does not need compressed mode to
perform inter-frequency measurements, and if higher layers do indicate
that the UE shall not perform any synchronisation procedure for timing
maintained intra- or inter-frequency hard handover, the interruption
time shall be less than Tinterrupt3

Tinterrupt3=20\*KC+150\*OC +10\*F~max~ ms

In the interruption requirement Tinterrupt3 a cell is known if the cell
has been measured by the UE during the last 5 seconds or the timing of
the cell is signalled from higher layers by the signal \"Reference time
difference to cell\" in \[16\], with the signalled accuracy lower than
or equal to 40 chips.

If inter-frequency hard handover is commanded and if higher layers do
indicate that the UE shall not perform any synchronisation procedure for
timing maintained intra- or inter-frequency hard handover, the
interruption time shall be less than Tinterrupt4

Tinterrupt4=50\*KC+150\*OC +10\*F~max~ ms

In the interruption requirement Tinterrupt4 a cell is known if the cell
has been measured by the UE during the last 5 seconds or the timing of
the cell is signalled from higher layers by the signal \"Reference time
difference to cell\" in \[16\], with the signalled accuracy lower than
or equal to 40 chips.

The phase reference is the primary CPICH.

The requirements in this section assume that N312 has the smallest
possible value i.e. only one insync is required.

5.3 FDD/TDD Handover
--------------------

### 5.3.1 Introduction

The purpose of FDD/TDD handover is to change the radio access mode from
FDD to TDD. The FDD/TDD handover procedure is initiated from UTRAN with
a RRC message that implies a hard handover as described in \[16\].

### 5.3.2 Requirements

The requirements in this section shall apply to UE supporting FDD and
TDD.

#### 5.3.2.1 FDD/TDD handover delay

RRC procedure performance values for all RRC procedures, that can
command a hard handover, are specified in \[16\].

When the UE receives a RRC message implying FDD/TDD handover with the
activation time \"now\" or earlier than RRC procedure delay seconds from
the end of the last TTI containing the RRC command, the UE shall be
ready to start the transmission of the new uplink DPCH within
D~handover~ seconds from the end of the last TTI containing the RRC
command.

If the access is delayed to an indicated activation time later than RRC
procedure delay seconds from the end of the last TTI containing the RRC
command, the UE shall be ready to start the transmission of the new
uplink DPCH at the designated activation time + interruption time.

where:

\- D~handover~ equals the RRC procedure performance value as defined in
\[16\] plus the interruption time stated in section 5.3.2.2.

#### 5.3.2.2 Interruption time

The interruption time, i.e. the time between the end of the last TTI
containing a transport block on the old DPDCH and the time the UE starts
transmission of the new uplink DPCH, is dependent on whether the target
cell is known for the UE or not.

If FDD/TDD handover is commanded, the interruption time shall be less
than,

T~interrupt~= T~offset~+T~UL~+30\*F~SFN~+20\*KC+180\*UC+10\*F~max~ ms

where,

T~offset~ Equal to 10 ms, the frame timing uncertainty between the old
cell and the target cell and the time that can elapse until the
appearance of a Beacon channel

T~UL~ Equal to 10 ms, the time that can elapse until the appearance of
the UL timeslot in the target cell

F~SFN~ Equal to 1 if SFN decoding is required and equal to 0 otherwise

KC Equal to 1 if a known target cell is indicated in the RRC message
implying FDD/TDD handover and equal to 0 otherwise

UC Equal to 1 if an unknown target cell is indicated in the RRC message
implying FDD/TDD handover and equal to 0 otherwise

F~max~ denotes the maximum number of radio frames within the
transmission time intervals of all transport channels that are
multiplexed into the same CCTrCH.

An inter-frequency TDD target cell shall be considered known by the UE,
if the target cell has been measured by the UE during the last 5
seconds.

The interruption time requirements for an unknown target cell shall
apply only if the signal quality of the unknown target cell is
sufficient for successful synchronisation with one attempt.

5.4 FDD/GSM Handover
--------------------

### 5.4.1 Introduction

The purpose of inter-RAT handover from UTRAN FDD to GSM is to transfer a
connection between the UE and UTRAN FDD to GSM. The handover procedure
is initiated from UTRAN with a RRC message (HANDOVER FROM UTRAN
COMMAND). The procedure is described in TS25.331 section 8.3.7.

Compressed mode according to the UE Capability may be used to be able to
make measurements on GSM.

### 5.4.2 Requirements

The requirements in this section shall apply to UE supporting FDD and
GSM.

The requirements given below in Tables 5.2 and 5.3 for the case where
the UE has not synchronised to the GSM cell before receiving the
HANDOVER FROM UTRAN COMMAND are valid when the signal quality of the GSM
cell is sufficient for successful synchronisation with one attempt. If
the UE is unable to synchronise to the GSM cell on the first attempt, it
shall continue to search for synchronisation information for up to 800
ms. If after 800 ms the UE has not synchronised to the GSM cell it shall
follow the handover failure procedure specified in \[16\].

#### 5.4.2.1 Handover delay

When the UE receives a RRC HANDOVER FROM UTRAN COMMAND with the
activation time \"now\" or earlier than RRC procedure delay (see below)
from the end of the last TTI containing the RRC command, the UE shall be
ready to transmit (as specified in TS 45.010) on the channel of the new
RAT within the value in table 5.2 from the end of the last TTI
containing the RRC command.

If the access is delayed to an indicated activation time later than RRC
procedure delay from the end of the last TTI containing the RRC command,
the UE shall be ready to transmit (as specified in TS 45.010) on the
channel of the new RAT at the designated activation time + interruption
time.

The UE shall process the RRC procedures for the RRC HANDOVER FROM UTRAN
COMMAND within 50 ms, which is noted as RRC procedure delay. If the
activation time is used, it corresponds to the CFN of the UTRAN channel.

within D~handover~ seconds from the end of the last TTI containing the
RRC command, where:

\- D~handover~ equals the maximum RRC procedure delay defined plus the

The UE shall process the RRC procedures for the RRC HANDOVER FROM UTRAN
COMMAND within 50 ms, which is noted as RRC procedure delay.

#### 5.4a.2.2 Interruption time

The interruption time is the time between end of the last TTI containing
the RRC command and the time the UE starts transmission of the PRACH in
the new E-UTRA cell, excluding RRC procedure delay. This requirement
applies when UE is not required to perform any synchronisation procedure
before transmitting on the new PRACH.

When inter-RAT handover to E-UTRAN is commanded, the interruption time
shall be less than Tinterrupt:

Tinterrupt = T~search~ + T~IU~ +20 ms

Where:

T~search~ is the time required to search the target cell when the target
cell is not already known when the handover command is received by the
UE. If the target cell is known, then T~search~ = 0 ms. If the target
cell is unknown and signal quality is sufficient for successful cell
detection on the first attempt, then T~search~ = 80 ms.

> T~IU~ T~IU~ is the interruption uncertainty in acquiring the first
> available PRACH occasion in the new cell.T~IU~ can be up to 30 ms.

NOTE: The actual value of T~IU~ shall depend upon the PRACH
configuration used in the target cell.

In the interruption requirement a cell is known if

\- it has been meeting the relevant cell identification requirements

identification requirements are described in \[24\].

The interruption time requirements for an unknown target cell shall
apply only if the signal quality of the unknown target cell is
sufficient for successful synchronisation with one attempt.

procedure delay. This requirement applies when the UE is not required to
perform any synchronisation procedure before transmitting on the new
PRACH.

When inter-RAT handover to E-UTRAN is commanded, the interruption time
shall be less than Tinterrupt

Tinterrupt = T~search~ + T~IU~ + 20 ms

Where:

> T~search~ is the time required to search the target cell when the

>
> T~IU~ is the interruption uncertainty in acquiring the first available
> PRACH occasion in the new cell. T~IU~ can be up to 30 ms.

to ensure the testability of autonomous CSG search, and are only
applicable when the 2^nd^ DRX cycle is configured, with a DRX cycle
length of equal to or greater than 1280msec.

Reselection from non CSG to CSG cells may be performed using UE
autonomous search as defined in \[1\] when at least one CSG ID is
included in the UE's **CSG** white**list**. The requirements in this
section are valid for reselection to CSG cells previously visited by the
UE when the radio configuration parameters, including the carrier
frequency and physical cell identity of the CSG cell, non CSG cell and
other neighbour cells are unchanged from the most recent previous visit.

NOTE: According to \[1\], the UE autonomous search function, per UE
implementation, determines when and/or where to search for allowed CSG
cells.

##### 5.5.2.1A.1 Reselection from a non CSG FDD to an inter-frequency FDD CSG cell

The UE shall perform search and reselection to an allowed
inter-frequency FDD CSG cell that has met CSG reselection criterion
defined in \[1\] and that is in its whitelist, within 6 minutes in the
conditions shown in table 5.3A. There is no need for statistical testing
of this requirement. When performing autonomous CSG search or
reselection to the CSG cell, the UE shall also meet the exsiting cell
reselection requirements defined in section 5.5.2.1.1-5.5.2.1.5. Where
applicable, the interruption time requirement of section 5.5.2.2 shall
apply. This requirement is not applicable if the SIB3 repetition period
in the CSG cell is the same length as the 2^nd^ DRX cycle in the serving
cell and SIB3 transmissions partially or wholly overlap periods in which
the UE is expected to receive HS-SCCH in the serving cell.

##### 5.5.2.1A.2 Reselection from a non CSG FDD to an inter-RAT E-UTRA CSG cell

The UE shall perform search and reselection to an allowed inter-RAT
E-UTRA CSG cell that has met CSG reselection criterion defined in \[1\]
and that is in its whitelist, within 6 minutes in the conditions shown
in table 5.3B. There is no need for statistical testing of this
requirement. When performing autonomous CSG search or reselection to the
CSG cell, the UE shall also meet the exsiting cell reselection
requirements defined in section 5.5.2.1.1-5.5.2.1.5. Where applicable,
the interruption time requirement of section 5.5.2.2 shall apply.

quality of the serving cell is good enough to allow decoding of the FACH
channel during the cell reselection.

##### 5.5.2.2.1 FDD-FDD cell reselection

The interruption time, i.e. the time between the last TTI the UE
monitors the FACH channel on the serving cell and the time the UE starts
transmit the preambles on the PRACH for sending the RRC CELL UPDATE
message in the target cell.

When intra-frequency cell reselection, or inter-frequency cell
reselection when the UE does not need measurement occasion to perform
inter-frequency measurements occurs, the interruption time shall be less
than Tinterrupt1

Tinterrupt1 = T~IU~+20+T~RA~ ms

where

T~IU~ is the interruption uncertainty when changing the timing from the
old to the new cell. T~IU~ can be up to one frame (10 ms).

T~RA~ The additional delay caused by the random access procedure.

When inter-frequency cell reselection occurs and the UE needs
measurement occasions to perform inter-frequency measurements, the
interruption time shall be less than Tinterrupt2

Tinterrupt2 = T~IU~+20+T~SI~+T~RA~ ms

where

T~SI~ the time required for receiving all the relevant system
information data according to the reception procedure and the RRC
procedure delay of system information blocks defined in 25.331.

In CELL\_FACH state the MTCH interruption time due to intra-frequency
cell reselection without soft combining during an MBMS session shall be
less than T~MTCH\_interrupt~ as specified in section 4.2.2.10.

##### 5.5.2.2.2 FDD-TDD cell reselection

The requirements in this section shall apply to UE supporting FDD and
TDD.

The interruption time, is defined as the time period between the last
TTI the UE monitors the FACH on the serving cell and the time instant
the UE starts to transmit the RRC CELL UPDATE message in the target
inter-frequency TDD cell on the RACH.

In case of inter-frequency cell reselection to a TDD cell and when the

information data according to the reception procedure and the RRC
procedure delay of system information blocks defined in \[16\].

T~RA~ is the additional delay caused by the random access procedure.

##### 5.5.2.2.3 FDD-GSM cell reselection

The interruption time, i.e. the time between the last TTI the UE
monitors the FACH channel and the time the UE starts transmit a RACH in
the target GSM cell.

When FDD-GSM cell reselection occurs the interruption time shall be less
than Tinterrupt, GSM

Tinterrupt,GSM = 40 +T~BCCH~+T~RA~ ms

where

T~BCCH~ = the maximum time allowed to read BCCH data from the GSM cell
\[21\].

T~RA~ = The additional delay caused by the random access procedure.

#### 5.5.2.3 Measurement and evaluation of cell selection criteria S of serving cell

The S-criteria detection delay is defined as the time between the
occurrence of an event which leads to that the cell selection criteria S
for serving cell is not fulfilled and the moment in time when the UE
detects that the cell selection criteria S for serving cell is not
fulfilled.

The UE shall filter the CPICH Ec/Io and CPICH RSCP measurements used for
cell selection criteria S evaluation of the serving cell over at least 3
measurement periods T~Measurement\_Period\ Intra~.

The S-critera detection delay in CELL\_FACH state shall be less than:

$T_{\text{S-criteria}} = 5 \times T_{\text{Measurement\_Period\ Intra}}$ms

where

T~Measurement\_Period\ Intra~ = Specified in 8.4.2.2.2.

The UE is \"out of service area\" if the UE has evaluated for 4 s that
that the serving cell does not fulfil the cell selection criterion S and
if the UE has not found any new suitable cell based on searches and
measurements of the neighbour cells indicated in the measurement control
system information during these 4 s. When the UE is \"out of service
area\" it shall initiate cell selection procedures for the selected PLMN
as defined in \[1\].

On transition from CELL\_DCH to CELL\_FACH, if a UE cannot find a
suitable UTRA cell, then it is considered to be \"out of service area\"
and shall perform actions according to \[16\].

If the S criterion of the serving cell is no longer fulfilled, the UE
may suspend MBMS reception if necessary to improve the UE's ability to
find a suitable cell.

If the S criterion of the serving cell is fulfilled, the measurement
requirements when a MBMS reception is active are specified in section
8.4.

##### 5.5.2.2.4 FDD-E-UTRA Cell Reselection

monitors the FACH channel and the time the UE starts transmit a RACH in
the target E-UTRAN cell.

When FDD-E-UTRAN cell reselection occurs the interruption time shall be
less than T~interrupt,\ E-UTRAN~.

T~interrupt,\ E-UTRAN~ = 40 +T~BCCH~+T~RA~ ms

where

T~BCCH~ = The maximum time allowed to read BCCH data from the E-UTRAN
cell \[24\].

T~RA~ = The additional delay caused by the random access procedure.

5.6 Cell Re-selection in CELL\_PCH
----------------------------------

### 5.6.1 Introduction

25.304, based on radio measurements, and if a better cell is found that
cell is selected.

### 5.6.2 Requirements

Requirements for cell re-selection in CELL\_PCH are the same as for cell

5.8 RACH reporting
------------------

### 5.8.1 Introduction

The network may request the UE to report on RACH cell CPICH levels for
the serving cell and up to 6 strongest monitored set cells and SFN-SFN
observed time difference between the serving cell and up to 6 different
monitored set cells.

### 5.8.2 Requirements

If all of the following conditions are true, the UE is allowed to have
an additional delay of N~RACH~\*50 ms in RACH transmission compared to
the normal RACH transmission delay:

\- SFN-SFN observed time difference measurement results are required to
be reported on RACH;

\- The set of cells on which the SFN-SFN observed time difference

measurement report;

\- The UE has not measured the SFN-SFN observed time differences for the
cells to be reported on RACH in the CELL\_FACH state according to the
requirements defined in Section 8.4.2.2.

able to report the requested measurement results on RACH within a normal
RACH transmission delay.

N~RACH~ is the number of cells requiring SFN decoding prior to the
reporting of SFN-SFN observed time difference measurement results on
RACH.

5.9 Inter-RAT cell change order from UTRAN in CELL\_DCH and CELL\_FACH
----------------------------------------------------------------------

### 5.9.1 Introduction

The purpose of inter-RAT cell change order from UTRAN FDD to GSM is to
transfer a connection between the UE and UTRAN FDD to GSM. This
procedure may be used in CELL\_DCH and CELL\_FACH state. The cell change
order procedure is initiated from UTRAN with a RRC message (CELL CHANGE
ORDER FROM UTRAN). The procedure is described in TS25.331 section
8.3.11.

NOTE: No procedure is defined for Inter-RAT cell change order from UTRAN
to E-UTRAN.

### 5.9.2 Requirements

The requirements in this section shall apply to UE supporting FDD and
GSM.

#### 5.9.2.1 Delay

When the UE receives a RRC CELL CHANGE ORDER FROM UTRAN COMMAND with the
activation time \"now\" or earlier than the value in table 5.4 from the
end of the last TTI containing the RRC command, the UE shall start
transmit the random access in the target cell of the new RAT within the
value in table 5.4 from the end of the last TTI containing the RRC
command.

If the access is delayed to an indicated activation time later than the
value in table 5.4 from the end of the last TTI containing the RRC
command, the UE shall start transmit the random access in the target
cell of the new RAT at the designated activation time.

The UE shall process the RRC procedures for the RRC CELL CHANGE ORDER
FROM UTRAN COMMAND within 50 ms. If the activation time is used, it
corresponds to the CFN of the UTRAN channel.

Table 5.4: Inter-RAT cell change order from UTRAN - delay

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------
  UE synchronisation status                                                                                 delay \[ms\]
  The UE has synchronised to the GSM cell before the CELL CHANGE ORDER FROM UTRAN COMMAND is received       90 + T~BCCH~ +T~RA~
  The UE has not synchronised to the GSM cell before the CELL CHANGE ORDER FROM UTRAN COMMAND is received   190 + T~BCCH~+T~RA~
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------

where

T~BCCH~ = the maximum time allowed to read BCCH data from the GSM cell
\[21\];

T~RA~ = the additional delay caused by the random access procedure.

#### 5.9.2.2 Interruption time

The requirements on interruption time below is valid when the signal
quality of the serving cell is good enough to allow decoding of the old
channel during the inter-RAT cell change order from UTRAN delay.

The interruption time, i.e. the time between the end of the last TTI
containing a transport block that the UE is able to receive on the old
channel and the time the UE starts transmit the random access in the
target cell, shall be less than the value in table 5.5. The requirement
in table 5.5 for the case, that UE is not synchronised to the GSM cell
before the CELL CHANGE ORDER FROM UTRAN COMMAND is received, is valid
when the signal quality of the GSM cell is good enough for successful
synchronisation with one attempt.

Table 5.5: Inter-RAT cell change order from UTRAN - interruption time

  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------
  Synchronisation status                                                                                    Interruption time \[ms\]
  The UE has synchronised to the GSM cell before the CELL CHANGE ORDER FROM UTRAN COMMAND is received       40 + T~BCCH~ +T~RA~
  The UE has not synchronised to the GSM cell before the CELL CHANGE ORDER FROM UTRAN COMMAND is received   140 + T~BCCH~+T~RA~
  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------

where

T~BCCH~ = the maximum time allowed to read BCCH data from the GSM cell
\[21\].

T~RA~ = the additional delay caused by the random access procedure

5.10 Serving HS-DSCH cell change
--------------------------------

### 5.10.3 Introduction

The serving HS-DSCH procedure is initiated from UTRAN with a RRC message
that implies a change of the serving HS-DSCH cell, see TS 25.331 section
8.2.2

### 5.10.2 Requirements

#### 5.10.2.1 Serving HS-DSCH cell change delay

Procedure delay for all procedures, that can command a HS-DSCH cell
change are specified in TS25.331 section 13.5.2.

When the UE receives a RRC message implying HS-DSCH cell change with the
activation time \"now\" or earlier than RRC procedure delay seconds from
the end of the last TTI containing the RRC command, the UE shall be
ready to receive the HS-SCCH channel from the new cell within
D~cell\_change~ seconds from the end of the last TTI containing the RRC
command.

If the access is delayed to an indicated activation time later than RRC
procedure delay seconds from the end of the last TTI containing the RRC
command, the UE shall be ready to start the transmission of the new
uplink HS-DPCCH at the designated activation time + interruption time.

where:

D~cell\_change~ equals the RRC procedure delay defined in TS25.331
Section 13.5.2 plus the interruption time of receiving HS-DSCH data
stated in section 5.10.2.2.

#### 5.10.2.2 Interruption time

The HS-DSCH interruption time is the time between the last received TTI
that can contain a transport block on the old HS-PDSCH and the time when
the UE is ready to transmit CQI reports based on the quality of the new
cell and the UE have started to receive the HS-SCCH of the new cell. The
interruption time is depending on whether the target cell is known for
the UE or not.

If serving HS-DSCH cell change is commanded to a cell in the active set
the HS-DSCH interruption time shall be less than Tinterrupt1

Tinterrupt1=T~IU~+22 ms

If an active set update, which includes a cell into the active set where
the cell is known, and serving HS-DSCH cell change is simultaneously
commanded to the same cell the HS-DSCH interruption time shall be less
than Tinterrupt2

Tinterrupt2=T~IU~+42 ms

where T~IU~ is the interruption uncertainty when changing the timing
from the old to the new cell. T~IU~ can be up to one subframe (2 ms).

The phase reference is the primary CPICH.

5.11 Enhanced Serving HS-DSCH cell change
-----------------------------------------

### 5.11.1 Introduction

The enhanced serving HS-DSCH cell change procedure is initiated from
UTRAN either with a RRC message that implies a change of the serving
HS-DSCH cell or through an HS-SCCH order sent on the target cell (target
cell is the cell which becomes the serving cell after the enhanced
serving HS-DSCH cell change procedure).

### 5.11.2 Requirements

When the UE receives a RRC message implying enhanced HS-DSCH cell
change, the serving cell change delay and interruption time requirements
are as defined in Section 5.10.

When the UE receives an HS-SCCH order from the target cell that implies
enhanced HS-DSCH serving cell change:

\- if the activation time is not equal to "now", the UE shall be ready
to receive the full configured HS-SCCH set from the target cell within
MAX{40 ms, activation time -- the end of the TTI containing the HS-SCCH
order} from the end of the TTI containing the HS-SCCH order.

\- if the activation time is set to "now", the UE shall be ready to
receive the full configured HS-SCCH set within 40 ms from the end of the
TTI containing the HS-SCCH order.

5.12 Interruption on Primary Uplink Frequency in DC-HSUPA
---------------------------------------------------------

### 5.12.1 Introduction

When the UE is configured with dual uplink carrier frequencies, the
transmission interruption on the primary uplink frequency can occur due
to the activation or deactivation of the secondary serving HS-DSCH cell
or of the serving E-DCH cell on the secondary uplink frequency.

The activation or deactivation procedure for the secondary serving
HS-DSCH cell or the serving E-DCH cell on the secondary uplink
frequency, is initiated from UTRAN with an HS-SCCH order \[18\], which
implies activation or deactivation of the secondary serving HS-DSCH cell
or the serving E-DCH cell on the secondary uplink frequency.

### 5.12.2 Requirements

The interruption time on the primary uplink frequency, T~interrupt~,
starts from the end of the last DPCCH slot which overlaps with the
HS-DPCCH subframe containing the ACK corresponding to the HS-SCCH order
for the activation or deactivation of the secondary serving HS-DSCH cell
or the serving E-DCH cell on the secondary uplink frequency. The UE
shall be ready to resume transmission of each physical channel on the
primary uplink frequency at the next slot, subframe or frame after
T~interrupt~ =4 ms, depending on the channel timing relationship defined
in \[2\] (next slot for DPCCH and next subframe for HS-DPCCH/2ms TTI
E-DCH). This requirement applies when the UE is configured with dual
uplink carrier frequencies.

5.13 System information acquisition for CSG cell
------------------------------------------------

### 5.13.1 Introduction

The requirements in this section apply to a UE which supports system
information acquisition of a CSG cell in preparation for handover. Both
intra frequency and inter frequency system information reading can be
configured, for the inter frequency case the UE may make autonomous gaps
in both downlink reception and uplink transmission. For intrafrequency
system information acquisition, interruption in downlink reception or
uplink tranmission shall not be performed to aquire system information.

### 5.13.2 CSG SI acquisition delay

The CSG SI acquisition delay is defined as the time between any
occurrences that will trigger a SI decoding until the UE starts to
transmit over the Uu interface. This requirement assumes that the
measurement report is not delayed by other RRC signalling on the DCCH.
The measurement reporting delay also excludes any RRC procedure delay
which is defined in \[16\] when SI reading is initiated by a measurement
control message.

For intra frequency CSG cells, CSG SI decoding is typically triggered
when a cell with primary scrambling code in a preconfigured range meets
the criteria for measurement reporting. For inter frequency CSG cells,
CSG SI decoding is explicitly requested by RRC signalling.

The CSG SI reporting delay shall not be more than T~CSG-SI-Report~ where
T~CSG-SI-Report~ in ms is given by

T~CSG-SI-Report~ = 630+ 40\*SIB3\_REP

SIB3\_REP is the repetition period at which the CSG cell schedules SIB3
blocks in units of frames

This requirement is applicable for CSG target cell configurations where
the information required to make the SI report can be determined from
the MIB and SIB3 alone, and SIB3 is not segmented into multiple TTI.
Additionally, for the requirement to be applicable, the reception
conditions shall be such that the system frame number of the target CSG
cell, the MIB and SIB3 can each be successfully decoded in no more than
four attempts. According to the reception conditions:

A cell shall be considered detectable when:

\- CPICH Ec/Io [\>]{.underline} -20 dB if DL\_DRX\_Active = 0, or CPICH
Ec/Io ≥-17dB if DL\_DRX\_Active=1,

\- SCH\_Ec/Io [\>]{.underline} -20 dB if DL\_DRX\_Active = 0, or SCH
Ec/Io ≥-17dB if DL\_DRX\_Active=1, for at least one channel tap and
SCH\_Ec/Ior is equally divided between primary synchronisation code and
secondary synchronisation code. When L3 filtering is used an additional
delay can be expected.

The system frame number, the MIB and SIB3 of the target CSG cell shall
be considered decodable provided the BCH demodulation requirements are
met according to \[3\].

### 5.13.3 Interfrequency CSG decoding interruption

When inter frequency CSG SI decoding of a neighbour cell is requested by
UTRAN, the UE may interrupt ongoing downlink reception, and uplink
transmission to perform the decoding on another frequency. The total of
the gaps in reception and the total of the gaps in transmission during
the period T~CSG-SI-Report~ shall not exceed T~CSG-SI-Interruption~
where T~CSG-SI-Interruption~ = 600ms. This requirement is applicable for
CSG target cell configurations where the information required to make
the SI report can be determined from the MIB and SIB3 alone, and SIB3 is
not segmented into multiple TTI. Additionally, for the requirement to be
applicable, the reception conditions shall be such that the system frame
number of the target CSG cell, the MIB and SIB3 can each be successfully
decoded in no more than four attempts. According to the reception
conditions:

A cell shall be considered detectable when:

\- CPICH Ec/Io \> -20 dB,

\- SCH\_Ec/Io \> -17 dB for at least one channel tap and SCH\_Ec/Ior is
equally divided between primary synchronisation code and secondary
synchronisation code. When L3 filtering is used an additional delay can
be expected.

The system frame number, the MIB and SIB3 of the target CSG cell shall
be considered decodable provided the BCH demodulation requirements are
met according to \[3\].

### 5.13.4 CSG reporting delay

Reporting delay results from delay uncertainty when inserting the
measurement report to the TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertainty
is twice the TTI of the uplink DCCH.

5.14 System information acquisition for inter-RAT E-UTRA cell
-------------------------------------------------------------

### 5.14.1 Identification of a new CGI of inter-RAT E-UTRA FDD cell with autonomous gaps

The UE shall identify and report the CGI when requested by the UTRAN for
the purpose of SI reading. To perform SI reading, the UE may make
autonomous gaps in both downlink reception and uplink transmission for
receiving MIB and SIB1 message of E-UTRAN cell \[27\] when the IE \"
E-UTRA SI Acquisition\" is received by the UE \[16\]. If the autonomous
gaps are used for the measurement with the purpose of SI reading, the UE
shall be able to identify a new CGI of inter-RAT E-UTRA cell within:

$T_{\text{identify\_CGI,\ E-UTRAN}} = T_{\text{basic}_{\text{identify\_CGI,\ E-UTRAN}}}\ \text{ms}$

Where

> T~basic\_identify\_CGI,\ E-UTRAN~ = \[300\] ms. This is the time
> period used in the above equation where the maximum allowed time for
> the UE to identify a new CGI of E-UTRA cell is defined.

A E-UTRAN cell shall be considered identifiable following conditions are
fulfilled:

\- RSRP related side conditions given in Section 9.1of \[24\] are
fulfilled for a corresponding Band,

\- SCH\_RP\|dBm and SCH Ês/Iot according to Annex B.4.1 for a
corresponding Band.

The MIB of an inter-RAT E-UTRA cell whose CGI is identified shall be
considered decodable by the UE provided the PBCH demodulation
requirements are met according to \[28\].

### 5.14.2 Identification of a new CGI of inter-RAT E-UTRA TDD cell with autonomous gaps

The UE shall identify and report the CGI when requested by the UTRAN for
the purpose of SI reading. To perform SI reading, the UE may make
autonomous gaps in both downlink reception and uplink transmission for
receiving MIB and SIB1 message \[27\] when the IE \" E-UTRA SI
Acquisition\" is received by the UE \[16\]. If the autonomous gaps are
used for the measurement with the purpose of SI reading, the UE shall be
able to identify a new CGI of inter-RAT E-UTRA cell within:

$T_{\text{identify\_CGI,\ E-UTRAN}} = T_{\text{basic}_{\text{identify\_CGI,\ E-UTRAN}}}\ \text{ms}$

Where

T~basic\_identify\_CGI,\ E-UTRAN~ = \[300\] ms. This is the time period
used in the above equation where the maximum allowed time for the UE to
identify a new CGI of E-UTRA cell is defined.

A cell shall be considered identifiable following conditions are
fulfilled:

\- RSRP related side conditions given in Section 9.1 of \[24\] are
fulfilled for a corresponding Band,

\- SCH\_RP and SCH Ês/Iot according to Annex B.4.1 for a corresponding
Band.

The MIB of an inter-RAT E-UTRA cell whose CGI is identified shall be
considered decodable by the UE provided the PBCH demodulation
requirements are met according to \[28\].

### 5.14.3 ECGI reporting delay

Reporting delay results from delay uncertainty when inserting the
measurement report to the TTI of the uplink DCCH and the RRC procedure
delay. The delay uncertainty is twice the TTI of the uplink DCCH.

5.15 Packet Loss Rate on Serving HS-DSCH Cells in Multi-Carrier HSDPA
---------------------------------------------------------------------

### 5.15.1 Introduction

A UE according to its measurement capability in the IE, "Inter-frequency
measurements on configured carriers without compressed mode" defined in
section 10.3.3.21 of TS 25.331 \[16\] may reconfigure its receiver
bandwidth when performing measurements on configured carrier frequencies
corresponding to secondary serving HS-DSCH cells. This may cause loss of
HS-DSCH reception from those primary and secondary serving HS-DSCH cells
whose carrier frequencies belong to the same frequency band as that of
the measured configured secondary carrier frequency.

### 5.15.2 Requirements

The probability of not sending ACK/NACK corresponding to HS-DSCH
transmitted to a UE by its primary or secondary serving HS-DSCH cell
shall not exceed 4% when the UE measures cells on any configured
secondary carrier frequency which belongs to the same frequency band as
that of the primary or secondary serving HS-DSCH cell.

6 RRC Connection Control
========================

6.1 RRC Re-establishment
------------------------

### 6.1.1 Introduction

RRC connection re-establishment is needed, when a UE in state CELL\_DCH
loses radio connection due to radio link failure. The procedure when a
radio link failure occurs in CELL\_DCH is specified in TS 25.331.

### 6.1.2 Requirements

The requirements in this section are applicable when the UE performs a
RRC Re-establishment to a cell belonging to any of the frequencies
present in the previous (old) monitored set.

The UE *moves from CELL\_DCH to CELL\_FACH state and* shall be capable
of sending a CELL UPDATE message using the cause \"radio link failure\"
within T~RE-ESTABLISH~ seconds from when the radio link failure
occurred.

T~RE-ESTABLISH~ equals the RRC procedure delay (T~RRC-RE-ESTABLISH~)
according to TS25.331 plus the UE Re-establishment delay
(T~UE-RE-ESTABLISH-REQ~), specified in 6.1.2.1.

T~RE-ESTABLISH~= T~RRC-RE-ESTABLISH~+ T~UE-RE-ESTABLISH-REQ~

#### 6.1.2.1 UE Re-establishment delay requirement

The UE Re-establishment delay requirement (T~UE-RE-ESTABLISH-REQ~) is
defined as the time between the moment when radio link failure is
considered by the UE, to when the UE starts to send preambles on the
PRACH.

T~UE-RE-ESTABLISH-REQ~ is depending on whether the target cell is known
by the UE or not. A cell is known if either or both of the following
conditions are true:

\- the UE has had radio links connected to the cell in the previous
(old) active set;

\- the cell has been measured by the UE during the last 5 seconds.

And the phase reference is the primary CPICH.

The UE Re-establishment delay requirement T~UE-RE-ESTABLISH-REQ~ shall
be less than

T~UE-RE-ESTABLISH-REQ-KNOWN~ =50ms+T~search~ + T~SI~+ T~RA~

in case that the target cell is known, and

T~UE-RE-ESTABLISH-REQ-UNKNOWN~ =50ms+T~search~\*NF + T~SI~ + T~RA~

in case that the target cell is not known by the UE.

where

*T~search~* is the time it takes for the UE to search the cell.

*T~search~* =100 ms if the target cell is known by the UE, and

*T~search~* =800 ms if the target cell is not known by the UE.

*T~SI~* is the time required for receiving all the relevant system
information data according to the reception procedure and the RRC
procedure delay of system information blocks defined in 25.331 for a
UTRAN cell (ms).

T~RA~ = The additional delay caused by the random access procedure.

*NF* is the number of different frequencies in the monitored set.

This requirement assumes radio conditions to be sufficient, so that
reading of system information can be done without errors.

6.2 (void)
----------

6.3 Random Access
-----------------

### 6.3.1 Introduction

The random access procedure is used when establishing the layer 1
communication between the UE and UTRAN. The random access shall provide
a fast access but without disturbing ongoing connections. The random
access is specified in section 6 of TS 25.214 and the control of the
RACH transmission is specified in section 11.2 of TS 25.321. A random
access transmit sequence is described in section 6.7.2 of TS 25.303. The
UE procedure for selecting 2 or 10 msec TTI when operating Enhanced
Uplink in CELL\_FACH is specified in 3GPP TS 25.321 \[19\].

### 6.3.2 Requirements

The UE shall have capability to calculate initial power according to the
open loop algorithm and apply this power level at the first preamble and
increase the power on additional preambles. The UE shall stop transmit
preambles upon a ACK/NACK on the AICH has been received or if the
maximum number of preambles within on cycle has been reached. Upon an
ACK has been received the UE shall transmit a message otherwise the
ramping procedure shall be repeated.

#### 6.3.2.1 Correct behaviour when receiving an ACK

The UE shall stop transmitting preambles upon a ACK on the AICH has been
received and then transmit a message..

The absolute power applied to the first preamble shall have an accuracy
as specified in table 6.3 of TS 25.101 \[3\]. The relative power applied
to additional preambles shall have an accuracy as specified in section
6.5.2.1 of 25.101 \[3\].

#### 6.3.2.2 Correct behaviour when receiving an NACK

The UE shall stop transmitting preambles upon a NACK on the AICH has
been received and then repeat the ramping procedure when the back off
timer T~B01~ expires.

#### 6.3.2.3 Correct behaviour at Time-out

The UE shall stop transmit preambles when reaching the maximum number of
preambles allowed in a cycle. The UE shall then repeat the ramping
procedure until the maximum number of preamble ramping cycles are
reached.

#### 6.3.2.4 Correct behaviour when reaching maximum transmit power

The UE shall not exceed the maximum allowed UL TX power configured by
the UTRAN.

The absolute power of any preamble shall not exceed the maximum allowed
UL TX power with more than specified in section 6.5.

#### 6.3.2.5 Correct behaviour when selecting 2 or 10msec TTI length for Enhanced Uplink in CELL\_FACH state and idle mode

A UE that is capable of 2/10msec TTI selection shall select a preamble
signature assigned to 2msec TTI when the TX power headroom based on the
TX power on the current preamble according to the method specified in
\[19\] is greater than the threshold value configured by UTRAN plus an
accuracy value of 6 dB. The UE shall select a preamble assigned to the
10msec TTI when the TX power headroom based on the TX power calculated
on the current preamble according to the method specified in \[19\] is
lower than the threshold value configured by UTRA minus the accuracy
value 6 dB. Otherwise, the UE may select a preamble signature assigned
to either 2msec or 10msec TTI.

6.4 Transport format combination selection in UE
------------------------------------------------

### 6.4.1 Introduction

When the UE estimates that a certain TFC and E-TFC would require more
power than the maximum transmit power, it shall limit the usage of
transport format combinations for the assigned transport format set,
according to the functionality specified in section 11.4 in TS25.321.
This is in order to make it possible for the network operator to
maximise the coverage. Transport format combination selection is
described in section 11.4 of TS 25.321.

When the UE has more than one Activated Uplink Frequency, the UE
estimates the power which may be allocated for all Activated Uplink
Frequencies. The E-TFC selection when the UE has more than one Activated
Uplink Frequency is described in section 11.8.1.4 of TS25.321

### 6.4.2 Requirements

The UE shall continuously evaluate based on the *Elimination,* *Recovery
and Blocking* criteria defined below, how TFCs on an uplink DPDCH can be
used for the purpose of TFC selection. The evaluation shall be performed
for every TFC in the TFCS using the estimated UE transmit power.

The UE transmit power estimation for a given TFC, when HS-DPCCH and
S-DPCCH are not transmitted during the measurement period, shall be
calculated using the DPDCH and DPCCH gain factors of the corresponding
TFC and reference transmit power. The reference transmit power is the
transmit power of DPCCH and DPDCH of a given TFC during the measurement
period for which UE transmit power estimation is made. If a single
HS-DPCCH is transmitted either partially or totally within the given
measurement period the UE transmit power estimation for a given TFC
shall be calculated using DPDCH and DPCCH gain factors, the maximum
value of the HS-DPCCH gain factor that is used during the measurement
period, and the reference transmit power. If two HS-DPCCHs are
transmitted either partially or totally within the given measurement
period then a maximum combined transmit power over both of the HS-DPCCHs
should be considered in the TFC calculation. Rules for calculating the
HS-DPCCH gain factors from the most recent signalled ∆~ACK~, ∆~NACK~ and
∆~CQI~ according to the specific multicarrier and MIMO configuration and
activation status of the secondary HS-DSCH serving cells are defined in
subclause 5.1.2.5A in \[18\]. The timing of the measurement period,
which is defined in 9.1.6.1 as one slot, is the same as the timing of
the DPCH slot. If S-DPCCH is transmitted within the given measurement
period, the UE transmit power for a given TFC shall be calculated using
the DPDCH and DPCCH gain factors, the HS-DPCCH power as described above
if one or two HS-DPCCH(s) are present, the S-DPCCH gain factor, and the
reference transmit power.

E-TFC selection is allowed only in CELL\_DCH state, CELL\_FACH state,
and Idle mode. E-TFC selection is based on the estimated power leftover
from TFC selection if the DPDCH is present and from the HS-DPCCH.

When the UE has one Activated Uplink Frequency, the UE shall estimate
the normalised remaining power margin available for E-TFC selection
based on the following equations for E-TFC candidate j

NRPM~j~= (PMax ~j~ - P~DPCCH,target~ - P~S-DPCCH~ - P~DPDCH~-
P~HS-DPCCH~- P~E-DPCCH,j~)/ P~DPCCH,\ target~ (1),

NRPM~j~= 0.5 \* (PMax ~j~ - P~DPCCH,target~ - P~S-DPCCH~ - P~HS-DPCCH~-
P~E-DPCCH,j~ -- P~S-E-DPCCH,j~)/ P~DPCCH,\ target~ (2),

where

Equation (2) is used when estimating the candidate E-TFCs for potential
rank-2 transmissions for UL MIMO, and equation (1) in used in all other
cases.

PMax~j~ = Maximum UE transmitter power for E-TFC-j as defined in section
6.5

P~DPCCH~(t) represents a slotwise estimate of the current UE DPCCH power
at time t. If at time t, the UE is transmitting a compressed mode frame
then P~DPCCH,comp~(t) = P~DPCCH~(t) × (N~pilot,C~/ N~pilot,N~) else
P~DPCCH,comp~(t) = P~DPCCH~(t). If the UE is not transmitting uplink
DPCCH during the slot at time t, either due to compressed mode gaps or
when discontinuous uplink DPCCH transmission operation is enabled then
the power shall not contribute to the filtered result.Samples of
P~DPCCH,comp~(t) shall be filtered using a filter period of 3 slotwise
estimates of P~DPCCH,comp~(t) when the E-DCH TTI is 2ms or 15 slotwise
estimates of P~DPCCHcomp~(t) when the E-DCH TTI is 10ms to give
P~DPCCH,filtered.~The accuracy of the P~DPCCH~ estimate shall be at
least that specified in table 6.0A

If the target E-DCH TTI for which NRPM~j~ evaluated does not correspond
to a compressed mode frame then P~DPCCH,target\ =~ P~DPCCH,filtered~.

If the target E-DCH TTI for which NRPM~j~ is being evaluated corresponds
to a compressed mode frame then P~DPCCH,target\ =~ P~DPCCH,filtered~×
(N~pilot,N~/ N~pilot,C~). N~pilot,N~ and N~pilot,C~ are numbers of pilot
symbols as defined in \[18\].

P~DPDCH~ = estimated DPDCH transmit power, based on P~DPCCH,target~ and
the gain factors from the TFC selection that has already been made. If
the target E-DCH TTI for which NRPM~j~ is being evaluated corresponds to
a compressed mode frame then the modification to the gain factors which
occur due to compressed mode shall be included in the estimate of
P~DPDCH.~

P~HS-DPCCH~ = estimated HS-DPCCH transmit power based on the maximum
HS-DPCCH gain factor and P~DPCCH,target~ If two HS-DPCCHs are
transmitted, P~HS-DPCCH~ is the maximum combined estimated transmit
power over both HS-DPCCHs. Rules for calculating the HS-DPCCH gain
factors from the most recent signalled ∆~ACK~, ∆~NACK~ and ∆~CQI~
according to the specific multicarrier and MIMO configuration and
activation status of the secondary HS-DSCH serving cells are defined in
subclause 5.1.2.5A in \[18\]. If the target E-DCH TTI for which NRPM~j~
is being evaluated corresponds to a compressed mode frame then the
modification to the gain factors which occur due to compressed mode
shall be included in the estimate of P~HS-DPCCH~.

P~E-DPCCH,j~ = estimated E-DPCCH transmit power for E-TFCI~j~, as
follows:.

\- For estimating the remaining power margin for a single transport
block in an E-DCH TTI (UL MIMO not configured, or rank1 with UL MIMO
configured); If E-TFCI~j~ is smaller than or equal to *E-TFCI~ec,boost~*
the estimate is based on P~DPCCH,target~ and the E-DPCCH gain factor
calculated using the most recent signalled value of ∆~E-DPCCH~. If
E-TFCI~j~ is greater than *E-TFCI~ec,boost~* the estimate is based on
the E-DPCCH gain factor,* β~ec,j~*, which is calculated for E-TFCI~j~
using the procedure in \[18\]. If the target E-DCH TTI for which NRPM~j~
is being evaluated corresponds to a compressed mode frame then the
modification to the gain factors which occur due to compressed mode
shall be included in the estimate of P~E-DPCCH~

\- For estimating the remaining power margin for transmission of two
transport blocks in an E-DCH TTI (Rank2 UL MIMO); The estimate is based
on the E-DPCCH gain factor,* β~ec,j~*, which is calculated for E-TFCI~j~
using the procedure in \[18\] assuming *E-TFCI~ec,boost~* = -1.

P~S-E-DPCCH,j~ = estimated S-E-DPCCH transmit power for E-TFCI~j~. The
estimate is based on the S-E-DPCCH gain factor,* β~sec,j~*, which is
calculated for E-TFCI~j~ as defined in \[18\].

P~S-DPCCH~ = estimated S-DPCCH transmit power, based on P~DPCCH,target~
and the S-DPCCH gain factor. In case neither the uplink CLTD operation
nor uplink MIMO operation is configured or one of the two is configured
with CLTD activation state 2 or 3, P~S-DPCCH~ is considered as zero.

NOTE: P~DPCCH~(t), PMax ~j~, P~DPCCH,target~, P~DPCCH,filtered~,
P~DPCCH,comp~(t), P~DPDCH~, P~HS-DPCCH~, P~S-DPCCH~, P~E-DPCCH~ and
P~S-E-DPCCH~ are expressed in linear power units

In CELL\_FACH state and Idle mode, if less than 3 E-DCH TTIs of DPCCH
transmission for 2ms TTI and less than 2 E-DCH TTIs of DPCCH
transmission for 10ms TTI is configured prior to the start of the E-DCH
transmissions, an estimate of P~DPCCH,\ target~ = P~preamble~ + P~p-e~
shall be used for initial E-TFC restriction. P~preamble~ is the code
power of the last transmitted PRACH preamble, and P~p-e~ is the power
offset between the power of the last transmitted preamble and the
initial DPCCH transmission power.

The UE shall consider the *Elimination* criterion for a given TFC to be
detected if the estimated UE transmit power needed for this TFC is
greater than the Maximum UE transmitter power for at least X out of the
last Y successive measurement periods immediately preceding evaluation.
The MAC in the UE shall consider that the TFC is in Excess-Power state
for the purpose of TFC selection.

MAC in the UE shall indicate the available bit rate for each logical
channel to upper layers within T~notify~ from the moment the
*Elimination* criterion was detected.

The UE shall consider the *Recovery* criterion for a given TFC to be
detected if the estimated UE transmit power needed for this TFC has not
been greater than the Maximum UE transmitter power for the last Z
successive measurement periods immediately preceding evaluation. The MAC
in the UE shall consider that the TFC is in Supported state for the
purpose of TFC selection.

MAC in the UE shall indicate the available bit rate for each logical
channel to upper layers within T~notify~ from the moment the *Recovery*
criterion was detected.

The evaluation of the *Elimination* criterion and the *Recovery*
criterion shall be performed at least once per radio frame.

The definitions of the parameters X,Y and Z which shall be used when
evaluating the *Elimination* and the *Recovery* criteria when no
compressed mode patterns are activated are given in Table 6.0.

Table 6.0: X, Y, Z parameters for TFC selection

  ---- ---- ----
  X    Y    Z
  15   30   30
  ---- ---- ----

The UE shall consider the *Blocking* criterion for a given TFC to be
fulfilled at the latest at the start of the longest uplink TTI after the
moment at which the TFC will have been in Excess-Power state for a
duration of:

(T~notify~ + T~modify~+ T~L1\_proc~)

where:

T~notify~ equals 15 ms, and

T~modify~ equals MAX(T~adapt\_max~,T~TTI~), and

T~L1\ proc~ equals 15 ms, and

T~adapt\_max~ equals MAX(T~adapt\_1~, T~adapt\_2~, \..., T~adapt\_N~),
and

N equals the number of logical channels that need to change rate, and

T~adapt\_n~ equals the time it takes for higher layers to provide data
to MAC in a new supported bitrate, for logical channel n. For services
where no codec is used T~adapt~ shall be considered to be equal to 0 ms.
For services where either UMTS\_AMR2 or UMTS\_AMR\_WB is used, Tadapt
shall be considered to be equal to the time required to switch from the
current codec mode to a new supported codec mode. In that case Tadapt
equals 20 ms + 40 ms per codec mode switch. E.g. Tadapt equals 60ms if
one codec mode switch is necessary and Tadapt equals 140ms if 3 codec
mode switches are necessary.

T~TTI~ equals the longest uplink TTI of the selected TFC (ms).

When the UE has one Activated Uplink Frequency, the UE shall be able to
update the normalised remaining power estimate of each E-TFC at least
every E-DCH TTI. The UE shall use the latest available estimate of
NRPM~j~ at the time when all absolute and relative grants relating to
the E-DCH TTI under consideration have been received. Using the
estimates of NRPM~j~ the UE shall evaluate for each E-TFC which
configured MAC-d flows are supported and which are unsupported as
follows:

In the case that the target E-DCH TTI for which E-TFC restriction is
being considered does not belong to a compressed mode frame then if
NRPM~j~≥ ∑(β~ed,j~/β~c~)^2^ then E-TFC~j~ can be supported, otherwise it
cannot be supported

In the case that the target E-DCH TTI for which E-TFC restriction is
being considered belongs to a compressed mode frame then if NRPM~j~≥
∑(β~ed,C,j~/β~c,C~)^2^ then E-TFC~j~ can be supported, otherwise it
cannot be supported

β~ed,j~/β~c~ and β~ed,C,j~/β~c,C~ is the quantized amplitude ratio.

If the UE is allowed to reduce its maximum transmit power for certain
TFCs and E-TFCs, the UE shall use the reduced maximum transmit power in
the evaluation of the TFC and E-TFC selection criteria for those TFCs.

When the UE has more than one Activated Uplink Frequency, if the TTIs
configured on the uplink carrier frequencies are at a common TTI
boundary, the UE shall estimate the remaining power which is available
to be allocated to scheduled E-DCH transmissions on all Activated Uplink
Frequencies. The total available power for scheduled E-DCH transmissions
is defined by:

P~remaining,s~=max(PMax - Σ~i~ P~DPCCH,target,i~ - P~HS-DPCCH~ -
P~DPDCH~ - P~non-SG~, 0)

If the TTIs configured on the uplink carrier frequencies are not at a
common TTI boundary and Activated Uplink Frequency k is configured with
10ms TTI, the total available power for scheduled E-DCH transmissions is
defined by:

P~remaining,s~=max(PMax - ∑~i~ P~DPCCH,target,i~ - P~HS-DPCCH~ -
P~DPDCH~ - P~non-SG~ -- P~k,~ 0)

The power Pk is the power of activated uplink frequency k, estimated by
using the current filtered power of the DPCCH and the power offset for
the E-TFC of the transmission for the carrier

where

PMax represents the Maximum UE Transmitter power, as defined in Section
6.5.

\- P~DPCCH,i~(t) represents a slotwise estimate of the current UE DPCCH
power for carrier with index i (i=0,1) at time t. If at time t, the UE
is transmitting a compressed mode frame then P~DPCCH,comp,i~(t) =
P~DPCCH,i~(t) × (N~pilot,C~/ N~pilot,N~) else P~DPCCH,comp,i~(t) =
P~DPCCH,i~(t). If the UE is not transmitting uplink DPCCH on the
Activated Uplink Frequency i during the slot at time t, either due to
compressed mode gaps or when discontinuous uplink DPCCH transmission
operation is enabled then the power shall not contribute to the filtered
result. Samples of P~DPCCH,comp,i~(t) shall be filtered using a filter
period of 3 slotwise estimates of P~DPCCH,comp,i~(t) if a 2ms TTI is in
use on carrier i, or a filter period of 15 slotwise estimates of
P~DPCCH,comp,i~(t) if a 10ms TTI is in use on carrier i. The accuracy of
the P~DPCCH,i~ estimate shall be at least that specified in table 6.0A

If the target E-DCH TTI for which RPM is being evaluated does not
correspond to a compressed mode frame then P~DPCCH,target,i\ =~
P~DPCCH,filtered,i~.

If the target E-DCH TTI for which RPM is being evaluated corresponds to
a compressed mode frame then P~DPCCH,target,i\ =~ P~DPCCH,filtered,i~×
(N~pilot,N~/ N~pilot,C~). N~pilot,N~ and N~pilot,C~ are numbers of pilot
symbols as defined in \[18\].

\- P~HS-DPCCH~ represents the estimated HS-DPCCH transmit power and
shall be calculated based on the estimated Primary Activated Frequency
DPCCH power, and the greatest HS-DPCCH gain factor and assuming the
maximum possible activity of HS-DPCCH over a 10ms period if a 10ms TTI
is in use. If two HS-DPCCHs are transmitted, P~HS-DPCCH~ is the maximum
combined estimated transmit power from both HS-DPCCHs. Rules for
calculating the HS-DPCCH gain factors from the most recent signalled
∆~ACK~, ∆~NACK~ and ∆~CQI~ according to the specific multicarrier and
MIMO configuration and activation status of the secondary HS-DSCH
serving cells are defined in subclause 5.1.2.5A in \[18\].

\- P~DPDCH~ represents estimated DPDCH transmit power on Primary
Activated Frequency based on P~DPDCH,target~ and the gain factors from
the TFC selection that has already been made. If the target E-DCH TTI
for which NRPMj is being evaluated corresponds to a compressed mode
frame then the modification to the gain factors which occur due to
compressed mode shall be included in the estimate of P~DPDCH~.

\- P~non-SG~ represents the power pre-allocated for non-scheduled
transmissions for Primary Uplink Frequency, as defined by \[19\]. An
estimate of the E-DPCCH power required for non-scheduled transmissions
may be included in P~non-SG~ .

When the UE has more than one Activated Uplink Frequency and no
retransmission is required, or when the UE has more than one Activated
Uplink Frequency and two retransmissions are required, the UE shall
estimate the normalised remaining power margin available for E-TFC
selection using the power allocated to the Primary Uplink Frequency
P~allocated,1~ and the power allocated to the Secondary Uplink Frequency
P~allocated,2~ defined by:

> P~allocated,1~ = P~1~ +P~non-SG,~
>
> P~allocated,2~ = P~2~

where

P~i~ represents the maximum remaining allowed power for scheduled
transmissions for the Activated Uplink Frequency i = 1,2, where index 1
and index 2 correspond to the index of the Primary Uplink Frequency and
the index of the Secondary Uplink Frequency as defined by \[19\]

When the UE has more than one Activated Uplink Frequency and one
retransmission is required in one Activated Uplink Frequency, the UE
shall estimate the normalised remaining power margin available for E-TFC
selection using the power allocated to the Activated Uplink Frequency
for which a retransmission is required P~allocated,x~ and on the power
allocated to the Activated Uplink Frequency for which no retransmission
is required P~allocated,y~ defined by:

> P~allocated,y~= PMax - P~HS-DPCCH~ - Σ~i~ P~DPCCH,target,i~ - P~DPDCH~
> - P~E-DPCCH,x~ - P~E-DPDCH,x~
>
> P~allocated,x~= P~E-DPCCH,x~ + P~E-DPDCH,x~

where

P~E-DPDCH,x~ represents the estimated E-DPDCH transmit power for the
Uplink Frequency for which a retransmission is required. The estimate is
based on P~DPCCH,target,x~ where x is denoting the index of the
Activated Uplink Frequency on which a retransmission required and the
E-DPDCH gain factor which will be used for the retransmission.

P~E-DPCCH,x~ represents the estimated E-DPCCH transmit power for the
Uplink Frequency for which a retransmission is required. The estimate is
based on P~DPCCH,target,x~ where x is denoting the index of the
Activated Uplink Frequency on which a retransmission is required and the
E-DPCCH gain factor which will be used for the retransmission.

When the UE has more than one Activated Uplink Frequency, the UE shall
estimate the normalised remaining power margin available for E-TFC
selection for the Activated Uplink Frequency i based on the following
equation for E-TFC candidate j:

NRPM ~i,j~ = (P~allocated,\ i~ -- P~E-DPCCHi,i~) / P~DPCCH,,target,i~

where

P~E-DPCCH,j,i~ represents the estimated E-DPCCH transmit power for
E-TFCI~j~ on the Activated Uplink Frequency i. If E-TFCI~j~ is smaller
than or equal to *E-TFCI~ec,boost~* the estimate is based on
P~DPCCH,target,i~ and the E-DPCCH gain factor calculated using the most
recent signalled value of ∆~E-DPCCH~. If E-TFCI~j~ is greater than
*E-TFCI~ec,boost~* the estimate is based on the E-DPCCH gain
factor,* β~ec,j~*, which is calculated for E-TFCI~j~ using the procedure
in \[18\]. If the target E-DCH TTI for which NRPM~j,i~ is being
evaluated corresponds to a compressed mode frame then the modification
to the gain factors which occur due to compressed mode shall be included
in the estimation.

In the case that the target E-DCH TTI for which E-TFC restriction is
being considered does not belong to a compressed mode frame then if
NRPM~j,i~≥ ∑(β~ed,j~/β~c~)^2^ then E-TFC~j~ can be supported on the
Activated Uplink Frequency i, otherwise it cannot be supported on that
Activated Uplink Frequency.

In the case that the target E-DCH TTI for which E-TFC restriction is
being considered belongs to a compressed mode frame then if NRPM~j,i~≥
∑(β~ed,C,j~/β~c,C~)^2^ then E-TFC~j~ can be supported on the Activated
Uplink Frequency i, otherwise it cannot be supported on that Activated
Uplink Frequency.

β~ed,j~/β~c~ and β~ed,C,j~/β~c,C~ is the quantized amplitude ratio.

6.5 Maximum allowed UL TX Power
-------------------------------

The Maximum UE transmitter power is defined as follows

Maximum UE transmitter power = MIN {Maximum allowed UL TX Power, P~MAX~}

Where

\- Maximum allowed UL TX Power is set by UTRAN and defined in \[16\],
and

\- P~MAX~ is the UE nominal maximum transmit power is defined by the UE
power class, and specified in table 6.1 of \[3\]

For DB-DC-HSUPA, the UE transmit power is considered to be the sum of
the transmit powers on both bands.

The UE shall not exceed the Maximum allowed UL TX Power, as set by the
UTRAN with the tolerances as defined for the UE transmitted power
(section 9.1.6). For UE output powers that are outside the range covered
by the UE transmitted power measurement the UE output power shall not
exceed the Maximum allowed UL TX Power with more than the tolerances
specified for the Open loop power control in TS 25.101 section 6.4.1.

For TFC selection the UE is allowed to reduce P~MAX~ when HS-DPCCH is
transmitted by the TFC-MPR values specified in table 6.1

6.7 CSG Proximity Indication for E-UTRAN and UTRAN
--------------------------------------------------

### 6.7.1 Introduction

The requirements defined in this section are applicable to a UE
supporting and configured with CSG proximity indication and are valid
when a UE is entering the proximity of one or more CSG member cell(s) or
leaving the proximity of all CSG member cell(s) on a UTRA or E-UTRA
frequency as specified in \[16\].

The detection of CSG proximity is based on a UE autonomous search
function.

### 6.7.2 Requirements

The UE shall initiate transmission of the *ProximityIndication* message
with \"entering\" according to \[16\] within \[6\] minutes after
entering the proximity of one or more CSG member cell(s) on a UTRA or
E-UTRA frequency.

The UE shall initiate transmission of the *ProximityIndication* message
with \"leaving\" according to \[16\] within \[6\] minutes after leaving
the proximity of all CSG member cell(s) on a UTRA or E-UTRA frequency.

There is no need for statistical testing of this requirement.

NOTE: Entering the proximity of one or more CSG member cell(s) means
that the UE is near a cell whose CSG ID is in the UE\'s CSG whitelist
(as determined based on autonomous search procedures). Leaving the
proximity of one or more CSG member cell(s) means that the UE is no
longer near any cell whose CSG ID is in the UE\'s CSG whitelist.

6.8 10ms Mode/20ms Mode switching in DCH
----------------------------------------

### 6.8.1 Introduction

When DL\_DCH\_FET\_Config \[7\] is configured by higher layers, the UE
shall continuously evaluate based on the *Restrict and Revive* criteria
defined below, what transmission mode can be used for each TFC on an
uplink DPDCH. The evaluation shall be performed for every TFC in the
TFCS using the estimated UE transmit power using 10ms Mode β~c~ and β~d~
gain factors, if signalled by higher layers.

### 6.8.2 Requirements

The UE shall estimate the transmit power for a TFC in 10ms Mode,
following the procedure in Subclause 6.4 using β~c~ and β~d~ gain
factors corresponding to 10ms Mode.

The UE shall consider the *Restrict* criterion for a given TFC
transmission mode to be detected if the estimated UE transmit power
needed for this TFC using the 10ms Mode is greater than the Maximum UE
transmitter power for at least K out of the last M successive
measurement periods immediately preceding evaluation.

The UE shall consider the *Revive* criterion for a given TFC to be
detected if the estimated UE transmit power needed for this TFC using
the 10ms Mode has not been greater than the Maximum UE transmitter power
for the last L successive measurement periods immediately preceding
evaluation.

The evaluation of the *Restrict* criterion and the *Revive* criterion
shall be performed at least once per radio frame, except if UL DPCCH is
DTXed according to Subclause 6C.2 of \[18\] in all slots in one radio
frame.

The parameters K, L and M are signalled by the higher layers.

7 Timing and Signalling characteristics
=======================================

7.1 UE Transmit Timing
----------------------

### 7.1.1 Introduction

The UE shall have capability to follow the frame timing change of the
connected Node B. The uplink DPCCH/DPDCH frame transmission takes place
approximately T~0~ chips after the reception of the first detected path
(in time) of the corresponding downlink DPCCH/DPDCH or F-DPCH frame,
from the reference cell. T~0~ is defined in \[2\]. UE initial transmit
timing accuracy, maximum amount of timing change in one adjustment,
minimum and maximum adjustment rate are defined in the following
requirements.

### 7.1.2 Requirements

The UE initial transmission timing error shall be less than or equal to
±1.5 Chips. This requirement applies at the first transmission on the
DPCCH/DPDCH. The reference point for the UE initial transmit timing
control requirement shall be the time when the first detected path (in
time) of the corresponding downlink DPCCH/DPDCH or F-DPCH frame is
received from the reference cell plus T~0~ chips. T~0~ is defined in
\[2\].

When the UE is not in soft handover, the reference cell shall be the one
the UE has in the active set. **In case the UE is initially allocated in
soft handover, the reference cell shall be the same cell as used for
calculating the initial CFN as defined in \[16\].**

The cell, which is selected as a reference cell, shall remain as a
reference cell even if other cells are added to the active set. In case
that the reference cell is removed from the active set the UE shall
start adjusting its transmit timing no later than the time when the
whole active set update message is available at the UE taking the RRC
procedure delay into account.

When the UE has performed a timing-maintained intra- or inter-frequency
hard handover and higher layers has indicated that the UE shall not
perform any synchronisation procedure for timing maintained intra- or
inter-frequency hard handover, or when the UE attempts to re establish
all dedicated physical channel(s) after an inter-RAT, intra- or
inter-frequency hard-handover failure \[18\], it shall resume UL
transmission with the same transmit timing as used immediately before
the handover attempt. After resuming transmission, transmit timing
adjustment requirements defined in the remainder of this clause apply.

The UE shall be capable of changing the transmission timing according to
the received downlink DPCCH/DPDCH or F-DPCH frame. When the transmission
timing error between the UE and the reference cell exceeds ±1.5 chips
the UE is required to adjust its timing to within ±1.5 chips.

All adjustments made to the UE timing shall follow these rules:

1\) The maximum amount of the timing change in one adjustment shall be ¼
Chip.

2\) The minimum adjustment rate shall be 233ns per second.

3\) The maximum adjustment rate shall be ¼ chip per 200ms.

In particular, within any given 800\*d ms period, the UE transmit timing
shall not change in excess of ±d chip from the timing at the beginning
of this 800\*d ms period, where 0≤d≤1/4.

7.2 UE Receive - Transmit Time Difference
-----------------------------------------

### 7.2.1 Introduction

The UE shall have the capability to be in soft handover with more than
one cell. The downlink DPCH frame timing or the downlink F-DPCH frame
timing shall take place approximately T~0~ chips before the transmission
of the uplink DPDCH/DPCCH. The adjustment requirements for the uplink
DPDCH/DPCCH timing are specified in 7.1.1. The valid range of the
Receive to Transmit time difference at the UE is defined in the
following requirements.

### 7.2.2 Requirements

A UE shall support reception, demodulation and combining of signals of a
downlink DPCH, or a downlink F-DPCH, when the receive timing is within a
window of T~0~ +/- 148 chip before the transmit timing where T~0~ is
defined in \[2\].

For downlink DPCH a UE is only required to react to TPC commands with a
transmit power adjustment in the immediate next slot if the downlink
receive timing of all cells in the active set is within a window of T~0~
+/- 148 chip before the uplink transmit timing.

For downlink F-DPCH, a UE is only required to react to TPC commands with
a transmit power adjustment in the immediate next slot after the end of
the TPC command combining period as defined in \[18\] if the downlink
receive timing of all cells in the active set is within a window of T~0~
+/- 148 chip before the uplink transmit timing.

If the downlink receive timing of one or more cells in the active set is
outside the window of T~0~ +/- 148 chip, the UE may also react with a
power adjustment one slot later. The receive timing is defined as the
first detected path in time.

7.3 UE timer accuracy
---------------------

### 7.3.1 Introduction

UE timers are used in different protocol entities to control the UE
behaviour.

### 7.3.2 Requirements

For UE timers T3xx, T~barred~, Treselection, Penalty\_time, T~CRmax~,
T~CrmaxHyst~ \[16\], UE shall comply with the timer accuracies according
to Table 7.1.

The requirements are only related to the actual timing measurements
internally in the UE. They do not include the following:

\- Inaccuracy in the start and stop conditions of a timer (e.g. UE
reaction time to detect that start and stop conditions of a timer is
fulfilled), or

\- Inaccuracies due to restrictions in observability of start and stop
conditions of a UE timer (e.g. TTI alignment when UE sends messages at
timer expiry).

Table 7.1

  ------------------- ----------
  Timer value \[s\]   Accuracy
  timer value \<4     ± 0.1 s
  timer value ≥4      ± 2.5 %
  ------------------- ----------

7.4 PRACH Burst timing accuracy
-------------------------------

### 7.4.1 Introduction

The UE shall have capability to transmit the PRACH burst according to
the timing of the received access slot \[18\]. The PRACH burst timing
accuracy is defined in the following requirement.

### 7.4.2 Requirements

The UE PRACH burst timing error shall be less than or equal to ± 3.5
Chips. The reference point shall be the expected timing calculated from
the UE's reference detected path of the P-CCPCH.

8 UE Measurements Procedures
============================

8.1 General Measurement Requirements in CELL\_DCH State
-------------------------------------------------------

### 8.1.1 Introduction

This section contains requirements on the UE regarding measurement
reporting in CELL\_DCH state. The requirements are split in FDD intra
frequency, FDD inter frequency, TDD, GSM and E-UTRAN measurements. These
measurements may be used by the UTRAN, e.g. for handover decisions. The
measurements are defined in TS 25.215, the measurement model is defined
in TS 25.302 and measurement accuracies are specified in section 9.
Control of measurement reporting is specified in TS 25.331 and parallel
measurements are specified in section 8.2. Compressed mode is specified
in TS 25.215.

If UE indicates support for increased UE carrier monitoring UTRA or
increased carrier monitoring E-UTRA, the measurement performance for
different carriers may be configured by higher layers to be either
normal or reduced. A measurement scaling factor \[16\] defining the
relaxation to be applied to the requirements for carriers measured with
reduced measurement performance is signalled by higher layers and has
the possible settings shown in table 8.0a.

Table 8.0a: Measurement scaling factor Configurations supported by the
UE

  --------------- --------------------------------------------------------- ------- ------

If no reduced performance group carrier is configured, the UE shall
consider all carriers to have normal performance. If no measurement
scaling factor is configured, a UE indicating support for increased
carrier monitoring UTRA or increased carrier monitoring E-UTRA shall
monitor at least the number of carriers specified in section 8.1.2.1 and
8.4.2.1 and is not required to monitor the increased number of carriers
specified in section 8.1.2.1a and 8.4.2.1a.

The minimum performance requirements for a UE which indicates support
for Increased UE carrier monitoring UTRA \[16, 31\] are calculated as
defined in section 8.1.2.3 provided that N~freq,n~≤2 or if all FDD
interfrequency carriers are indicated to have normal performance. The
minimum performance requirements for a UE which indicates support for
Increased UE carrier monitoring E-UTRA \[16, 31\] are calculated as
defined in section 8.1.2.6 provided that N~freq,E-UTRA,n~≤4 *for a UE
capable of either FDD E-UTRA carriers or TDD E-UTRA carrier monitoring*
or N~freq,E-UTRA,n~≤8 *for a UE capable of both FDD and TDD E-UTRA
carrier monitoring provided* N~freq,E-UTRA,n,FDD~≤4 *and*
N~freq,E-UTRA,n,TDD~≤4 or if all E-UTRA carriers are indicated to have
normal performance.

Capabilities for number of carriers to monitor for UE which indicates
support for Increased UE carrier monitoring UTRA or E-UTRA are specified
in section 8.1.2.1a.

### 8.1.2 Requirements

#### 8.1.2.1 UE Measurement Capability

In CELL\_DCH state, when a single uplink carrier frequency is
configured, the UE shall be able to monitor up to

\- 32 intra frequency FDD cells (including active set); and

\- 32 inter frequency cells, including

> \- FDD cells distributed on up to 2 additional FDD carriers; and
>

measurements according to this section.

The received CPICH E~c~/I~o~ is defined as

$\ \left( \frac{\text{CPICH}_{}}{I_{o}} \right)|_{\text{in}\ \text{dB}} = \left( \frac{\text{CPICH}_{}}{I_{\text{or}}} \right)|_{\text{in}\ \text{dB}} - \frac{I_{o}}{\left( {\hat{I}}_{\text{or}} \right)}|_{\text{in}\ \text{dB}}$

and the received SCH E~c~/I~o~ is defined as

$\ \left( \frac{\text{SCH}_{}}{I_{o}} \right)|_{\text{in}\ \text{dB}} = \left( \frac{\text{SCH}_{}}{I_{\text{or}}} \right)|_{\text{in}\ \text{dB}} - \frac{I_{o}}{\left( {\hat{I}}_{\text{or}} \right)}|_{\text{in}\ \text{dB}}$

according to capabilities in \[16,31\] shall additionally be capable of
monitoring at least

80 inter-frequency cells, including

\- 5 FDD UTRA inter-frequency carriers with up to 32 cells per carrier.

frequency layers, which includes serving layer, comprising of any above
defined combination of *of E-UTRA FDD, E-UTRA TDD, UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD

#### 8.1.2.2 FDD intra frequency measurements

During the CELL\_DCH state the UE shall continuously measure identified
intra frequency cells and search for new intra frequency cells in the
monitoring set. In case the network requests the UE to report detected
set cells, the UE shall also search for intra frequency cells outside
the monitored and active set. Cells, which are neither included in the
active set nor in the monitored set, and are identified by the UE belong
to the detected set according to TS 25.331. If compressed mode pattern
sequences are activated, intra frequency measurements can be performed
between the transmission gaps simultaneously for data reception from the
active set cell/s. If DL\_DRX\_Active=1, and the UE is performing DRX,
intra frequency measurements can be performed when the receiver is
active, simultaneously to data reception from the active set cell/s.

The performance of intra frequency measurements when IPDL is active has
not been studied.

A cell shall be considered detectable when

\- CPICH Ec/Io [\>]{.underline} -20 dB if DL\_DRX\_Active = 0, or CPICH
Ec/Io ≥-17dB if DL\_DRX\_Active=1,

\- SCH\_Ec/Io [\>]{.underline} -20 dB if DL\_DRX\_Active = 0, or SCH

secondary synchronisation code. When L3 filtering is used an additional
delay can be expected.

In case of conflict when a compressed gap sequence is activated the UE
may choose to prioritise the SFN decoding

The UE shall be able to identify a new detectable cell not belonging to
the monitored set within

$T_{\text{identify}\ \text{\ detected\ set}} = \text{30}s$

when CPICH Ec/Io [\>]{.underline} -20 dB, SCH\_Ec/Io [\>]{.underline}
-17 dB and SCH\_Ec/Ior is equally divided between primary
synchronisation code and secondary synchronisation code. When L3

###### 8.1.2.2.1.1 Identification of a new cell using IPDL gaps

When the UE is supporting IPDL measurements and when idle periods with a
length of 1 slot are scheduled the UE physical layer shall be capable to
identify a new cell and report SFN-SFN observed time difference type 2
measurement within

T~identify,IPDL~=Max{T~Measerement\_Period\ Intra~,T~IPDL~} ms

where

T~Measurement\_Period\ Intra~ = The measurement period for Intra
frequency CPICH measurements defined in Section 8.1.2.2.2.

and

T~IPDL~ depends on the Search Window Size given in UE positioning OTDOA
neighbour cell info as given in Table 8.0

Table 8.0: T~IPDL~

  ------------------------------------ -----------------------------------------------
  Search Window Size                   T~IPDL~

  +/- 80 chips                         Time over which 8 consecutive IPDL gaps occur
  ------------------------------------ -----------------------------------------------

##### 8.1.2.2.2 UE CPICH measurement capability 

In the CELL\_DCH state the measurement period for intra frequency
measurements is 200 ms. When no transmission gap pattern sequence is
activated and DL\_DRX\_Active=0, the UE shall be capable of performing
CPICH measurements for 8 identified-intra-frequency cells of the
monitored set and/or the active set, and the UE physical layer shall be
capable of reporting measurements to higher layers with the measurement
period of 200 ms. When one or more transmission gap pattern sequences
are activated, and/or DL\_DRX\_Active=1, the UE shall be capable of
performing CPICH measurements for at least Y~measurement\ intra~ cells ,
where Y~measurement\ intra~ is defined in the following equation. The
measurement accuracy for all measured cells shall be as specified in the
sub-clause 9.1.1 and 9.1.2. If the UE has identified more than
Y~measurement\ intra~ cells, the UE shall perform measurements of all
identified cells but the reporting rate of CPICH measurements of cells
from UE physical layer to higher layers may be decreased.

$Y_{\text{measurement}\ \text{\ intra}} = \text{Floor}\left\{ X_{\text{basic}\ \text{measurement}\ \text{FDD}} \cdot \frac{T_{\text{Intra}}}{T_{\text{Measurement}\ \text{\ Period,\ Intra}}} \right\}$
cells

where

X~basic\ measurement\ FDD~ = 8 (cells)

T~Measurement\_Period\ Intra~ = 200 ms. The measurement period for Intra
frequency CPICH measurements.

T~Intra~ : This is the minimum time that is available for intra
frequency measurements, during the measurement period with an
arbitrarily chosen timing. If DL\_DRX\_Active=1, and the UE is
performing DRX, intra frequency measurements are assumed only to be
performed when the receiver is guaranteed to be active, and
simultaneously to data reception from the active set cell/s.

T~basic\_identify\_FDD,\ intra~ = 800 ms. This is the time period used
in the intra frequency equation where the maximum allowed time for the
UE to identify a new FDD cell is defined.

The UE shall furthermore be capable of performing CPICH measurements for
at least 1 detected intra-frequency cell, in the detected set, and the
UE physical layer shall be capable of reporting measurements to higher
layers with the measurement period of 10 s. The measurement accuracy for
all measured cells shall be as specified in the sub-clause 9.1.1 and
9.1.2.

###### 8.1.2.2.2.1 Capabilities for measurements during IPDL gaps

When idle periods with a length of 1 slot are scheduled, the UE physical
layer shall be capable of reporting SFN-SFN observed time difference
type 2 measurements to higher layers with measurement accuracy as
specified in sub-clause 9.1.8.2.2 with measurement period given by

$T_{\text{measurement}\ \text{\ IPDL}} = \text{Max}\left\{ T_{\text{Measurement\_Period\ Intra\ }},T_{\text{4\ IPDLs}} \right\}\text{ms}$

where

T~Measurement\_Period\ Intra~ = The measurement period for Intra
frequency CPICH measurements defined in Section 8.1.2.2.2.

T~4\ IPDLs~ = Time period over which 4 consecutive idle periods occur.

##### 8.1.2.2.3 Periodic Reporting

Reported measurements contained in periodically triggered measurement
reports shall meet the requirements in section 9.

##### 8.1.2.2.4 Event-triggered Periodic Reporting

Reported measurements contained in event triggered periodic measurement
reports shall meet the requirements in section 9.

The first report in event triggered periodic measurement reporting shall
meet the requirements specified in section 8.1.2.2.3 Event Triggered
Reporting.

##### 8.1.2.2.5 Event Triggered Reporting

Reported measurements contained in event triggered measurement reports
shall meet the requirements in section 9.

The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as long as
the reporting criteria are not fulfilled.

The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between any event
that will trigger a measurement report until the UE starts to transmit
over the Uu interface. This requirement assumes that the measurement
report is not delayed by other RRC signalling on the DCCH. This
measurement reporting delay excludes a delay uncertainty resulted when
inserting the measurement report to the TTI of the uplink DCCH. The
delay uncertainty is twice the TTI of the uplink DCCH.

The event triggered measurement reporting delay, on cells belonging to
monitored set, measured without L3 filtering, shall be less than the
above defined T~identify\ intra~ defined in Section 8.1.2.2.1

If a cell, belonging to monitored set, which the UE has identified and
measured at least once over the measurement period, becomes undetectable
for a period ≤ 5 seconds and then the cell becomes detectable again and
triggers an event, the measurement reporting delay shall be less than
T~Measurement\_Period\ Intra~ ms provided the timing to that cell has
not changed more than +/-32 chips, the UE CPICH measurement capabilities
of section 8.1.2.2.2 are valid and L3 filtering has not been used. When
L3 filtering is used an additional delay can be expected.

If a cell belonging to monitored set has been detectable at least for
the time period T~identify\_intra~ and then triggers the measurement
report as per TS 25.331, section 14 \[16\], the event triggered
measurement reporting delay shall be less than
T~Measurement\_Period\ Intra~ when the L3 filter has not been used and
the UE CPICH measurement capabilities of Section 8.1.2.2.2 are valid.

The event triggered measurement reporting delay on cells not belonging
to monitored set, measured without L3 filtering, shall be less than the
above defined T ~identify\ detected\ set~ defined in Section 8.1.2.2.1.

#### 8.1.2.3 FDD inter frequency measurements

In the CELL\_DCH state when a transmission gap pattern sequence with the
\"FDD measurements\" purpose is provided by the network the UE shall
continuously measure identified inter frequency cells and search for new
inter frequency cells indicated in the measurement control information.

In order for the requirements in the following subsections to apply the
UTRAN must provide a transmission gap pattern sequence with measurement
purpose FDD measurement using the following combinations for TGL1, TGL2,
TGD and Max TGPL:

A cell shall be considered detectable when

\- CPICH Ec/Io [\>]{.underline} -20 dB,

\- SCH\_Ec/Io [\>]{.underline} -17 dB for at least one channel tap and

##### 8.1.2.3.2 UE CPICH measurement capability

When transmission gaps are scheduled for FDD inter frequency
measurements the UE physical layer shall be capable of reporting
measurements to higher layers with measurement period given by

$T_{\text{measurement}\ \text{\ inter}} = \text{Max}\left\{ T_{\text{Measurement\_Period\ Inter}},T_{\text{basic}\ \text{measurement}\ \text{FDD\ inter}} \cdot \frac{T_{\text{Measurement\_Period\ Inter}}}{T_{\text{Inter}}} \cdot K_{n} \cdot N_{\text{freq},n} \right\}\text{ms}$
(normal performance) and

$T_{\text{measurement}\ \text{\ inter}} = \text{Max}\left\{ T_{\text{Measurement\_Period\ Inter}},T_{\text{basic}\ \text{measurement}\ \text{FDD\ inter}} \cdot \frac{T_{\text{Measurement\_Period\ Inter}}}{T_{\text{Inter}}} \cdot K_{r} \cdot N_{\text{freq},r} \right\}\text{ms}$
(reduced performance)

If the UE does not need compressed mode to perform inter-frequency
measurements, the measurement period for inter frequency measurements is
480 ms.

The UE shall be capable of performing CPICH measurements for
X~basic\ measurement\ FDD\ inter~ inter-frequency cells per FDD
frequency of the monitored set or the virtual active set, or the
detected set for UE that supports inter frequency detected set
meaurements, and the UE physical layer shall be capable of reporting
measurements to higher layers with the measurement period of
T~Measurement\_Inter.~ If the UE has identified more than Xbasic
measurement FDD inter cells, the UE shall perform measurements of all
identified cells but the reporting rate of CPICH measurements of cells
from UE physical layer to higher layers may be decreased.

X~basic\ measurement\ FDDinter~ = 6

T~Measurement\_Period\ Inter~ = 480 ms. The period used for calculating
the measurement period T~measurement\_inter~ for inter frequency CPICH
measurements.

T~Inter::~ This is the minimum time that is available for inter
frequency measurements , during the period T~Measurement\_Period\ inter~
with an arbitrarily chosen timing. The minimum time per transmission gap
is calculated by using the actual idle length within the transmission
gap as given in the table 11 of Annex B in TS 25.212 and by assuming
2\*0.5 ms for implementation margin and after that taking only full
slots into account in the calculation.

T~basic\_identify\_FDD,inter~ = 300 ms. This is the time period used in
the inter frequency equation where the maximum allowed time for the UE
to identify a new FDD cell is defined.

T~basic\_measurement\_FDD\ inter~ = 50 ms. This is the time period used
in the equation for defining the measurement period for inter frequency
CPICH measurements.

N~Freq~: Number of FDD frequencies indicated in the inter frequency
measurement control information.

N~freq,n~ : Number of interfrequency carriers to be monitored with
normal performance

> N~freq,r~: Number of interfrequency carriers to be monitored with
> reduced performance
>
> If N~freq,r~ is not equal to zero then K~n~ and K~r~ are as shown in
> table 8.0a. Otherwise K~n~=1 and all interfrequency layers have normal
> performance.

> The minimum performance requirements for a UE which does not indicate

> calculated assuming all UTRA carriers required to be monitored for
> such UE, are having normal performance and are in normal performance
> group, i.e. N~freq,n~ = N~Freq~ and N~freq,r~ =0.

The measurement accuracy for all measured cells shall be as inter
frequency measurement accuracy specified in the sub-clause 9.1.1 and
9.1.2.

##### 8.1.2.3.3 Periodic Reporting

Reported measurements in periodically triggered measurement reports
shall meet the requirements in section 9.

##### 8.1.2.3.4 Event Triggered Reporting

Reported measurements in event triggered measurement reports shall meet
the requirements in section 9.

The UE shall not send any event triggered measurement reports, as long
as the reporting criteria is not fulfilled.

The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between any event
that will trigger a measurement report until the UE starts to transmit
the measurement report over the Uu interface. This requirement assumes
that the measurement report is not delayed by other RRC signalling on
the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes a delay uncertainty
resulted when inserting the measurement report to the TTI of the uplink
DCCH. The delay uncertainty is twice the TTI of the uplink DCCH.

The event triggered measurement reporting delay of a cell belonging to
the monitored set, measured without L3 filtering shall be less than T
~identify\ inter~ defined in Section 8.1.2.3.1 When L3 filtering is used
an additional delay can be expected.

The event triggered measurement reporting delay of a cell belonging to
the detected set, measured without L3 filtering shall be less than
T~identify\ inter\ detected\ set~ defined in Section 8.1.2.3.1~.~ When
L3 filtering is used an additional delay can be expected.

If a cell belonging to a monitored set has been detectable at least for
the time period T~identify\_inter~ or a cell belonging to a detected set
has been detectable at least for the time period
T~identify\ inter\ detected\ set~ and then triggers the measurement
report as per TS 25.331, section 14 \[16\], the event triggered
measurement reporting delay shall be less than
T~Measurement\_Period\ Inter~ provided the timing to that cell has not
changed more than +/-32 chips while transmission gap has not been
available and the L3 filter has not been used.

If one of the following conditions is met,

1\) if the UE does not need compressed mode to measure cells on a
frequency adjacent to the intra-frequency (irrespective of the number of
serving cells configured in the UE) according to its measurement
capability in the IE "Adjacent Frequency measurements without compressed
mode" defined in section 10.3.3.21 of TS 25.331 \[16\], and if the
Adjacent Frequency Index \[16\] is configured; or

2\) if the UE does not need compressed mode to measure cells on a
frequency in a band jointly supported with the band of intra-frequency
according to its measurement capability in the IE "Inter-band Frequency
measurements without compressed mode" defined in section 10.3.3.21 of TS
25.331 \[16\]; or

3\) if the UE is able to search enhanced inter-frequency measurements
without compressed mode according to its measurement capability in the
IE "Enhanced inter-frequency measurements without compressed mode"
defined in section 10.3.3.21 of TS 25.331 \[16\]; or

4\) if the UE does not need compressed mode to measure cells on
configured carrier frequencies corresponding to secondary serving
HS-DSCH cells according to its measurement capability in the IE,
"Inter-frequency measurements on configured carriers without compressed
mode" defined in section 10.3.3.21 of TS 25.331 \[16\],,

the event triggered measurement reporting delay of a cell belonging to
the monitored set, measured without L3 filtering shall be less than T
~identify,inter,optional~ defined in Section 8.1.2.3.1. When L3
filtering is used an additional delay can be expected. If a cell has
been detectable at least for the time period T~identify,inter,optional~
and then triggers the measurement report as per TS 25.331, section 14
\[16\], the event triggered measurement reporting delay shall be less
than T~Measurement\_Period\ Intra~ defined in Section 8.1.2.2.2 provided
the timing to that cell has not changed more than +/-32 chips while
transmission gap has not been available and the L3 filter has not been
used.

#### 8.1.2.4 TDD measurements

The requirements in this section shall apply to UE supporting FDD and
TDD.

In the CELL\_DCH state when a transmission gap pattern sequence with the
\"TDD measurements\" purpose is provided by the network, the UE shall
continuously measure identified inter frequency TDD cells and search for
new inter frequency TDD cells indicated in the measurement control
information.

In order for the requirements in the following subsections to apply, the
Beacon timeslots of the inter-frequency TDD cells indicated in the
measurement control information shall either be synchronised or
non-overlapping in time such that the UE can measure an inter-frequency
TDD cell at least once in every transmission gap pattern as given in
\[7\] for the slot allocation case in use in this cell and by assuming
2\*0.5 ms implementation margin per transmission gap.

UTRAN shall provide a transmission gap pattern sequence with measurement
purpose TDD measurement using the combinations for TGL1, TGL2 and TGD in
Table 8.2:

##### 8.1.2.4.1 Identification of a new cell

###### 8.1.2.4.1.1 3,84 Mcps TDD Option

When transmission gaps are scheduled for inter-frequency TDD
measurements, the UE shall be able to identify a new detectable
inter-frequency TDD cell belonging to the monitored set within

$T_{\text{identify\ TDD}\ \text{inter}} = \text{Max}\left\{ \ \text{5000},N_{\text{basic}\ \text{identify}\ \text{TDD\ inter}} \cdot \frac{T_{\text{Measurement}\ \text{\ Period\ \ TDD\ inter}}}{N_{\text{TDD\ inter}}} \cdot N_{\text{Freq}} \right\}\text{ms}$

If the UE does not need compressed mode to perform inter-frequency TDD
measurements, the UE shall be able to identify a new detectable
inter-frequency TDD cell belonging to the monitored set within 5000 ms.

When L3 filtering is used an additional delay can be expected.

An inter-frequency TDD cell shall be considered detectable when P-CCPCH
Ec/Io ≥ -8 dB and SCH\_Ec/Io ≥ -13 dB.

The received P-CCPCH\_E~c~/I~o~ is defined as

$\ \left( \frac{P - \text{CCPCH}_{}}{I_{o}} \right)|_{\text{in}\ \text{dB}} = \left( \frac{P - \text{CCPCH}_{}}{I_{\text{or}}} \right)|_{\text{in}\ \text{dB}} - \frac{I_{o}}{\left( {\hat{I}}_{\text{or}} \right)}|_{\text{in}\ \text{dB}}$

and the received SCH\_E~c~/I~o~ is defined as

$\ \left( \frac{\text{SCH}_{}}{I_{o}} \right)|_{\text{in}\ \text{dB}} = \left( \frac{\text{SCH}_{}}{I_{\text{or}}} \right)|_{\text{in}\ \text{dB}} - \frac{I_{o}}{\left( {\hat{I}}_{\text{or}} \right)}|_{\text{in}\ \text{dB}}$

###### 8.1.2.4.1.2 1.28 Mcps TDD Option

measurements, the UE shall be able to identify a new detectable
inter-frequency TDD cell belonging to the monitored set within

$T_{\text{identify\ TDD}\ \text{inter}} = \text{Max}\left\{ \ \text{5000},N_{\text{basic}\ \text{identify}\ \text{TDD\ inter}} \cdot \frac{T_{\text{Measurement}\ \text{\ Period\ \ TDD\ inter}}}{N_{\text{TDD\ inter}}} \cdot N_{\text{Freq}} \right\}\text{ms}$

If the UE does not need compressed mode to perform inter-frequency TDD
measurements, the UE shall be able to identify a new detectable
inter-frequency TDD cell belonging to the monitored set within 5000 ms.

When L3 filtering is used an additional delay can be expected.

A cell shall be considered detectable when P-CCPCH Ec/Io
[\>]{.underline} -8 dB and DwPCH\_Ec/Io [\>]{.underline} -5 dB. When L3
filtering is used an additional delay can be expected.

The received P-CCPCH E~c~/I~o~ is defined as

$\ \left( \frac{P - \text{CCPCH}_{}}{I_{o}} \right)|_{\text{in}\ \text{dB}} = \left( \frac{P - \text{CCPCH}_{}}{I_{\text{or}}} \right)|_{\text{in}\ \text{dB}} - \frac{I_{o}}{\left( {\hat{I}}_{\text{or}} \right)}|_{\text{in}\ \text{dB}}$

The received DwPTS E~c~/I~o~ is defined as

$\ \left( \frac{\text{DwPCH}_{}}{I_{o}} \right)|_{\text{in}\ \text{dB}} = \left( \frac{\text{DwPCH}_{}}{I_{\text{or}}} \right)|_{\text{in}\ \text{dB}} - \frac{I_{o}}{\left( {\hat{I}}_{\text{or}} \right)}|_{\text{in}\ \text{dB}}$

##### 8.1.2.4.2 P-CCPCH RSCP measurement period

When transmission gaps are scheduled for inter frequency TDD
measurements the UE physical layer shall be capable of reporting
measurements to higher layers with measurement accuracy as specified in
sub-clause 9.1.11 and with a measurement period as given by

$T_{\text{measurement\ \ TDD\ \ inter}} = \text{Max}\left\{ T_{\text{Measurement\ Period\ \ TDD\ inter}},N_{\text{basic\ }\ \text{measurement}\ \text{TDD\ inter}} \cdot \frac{T_{\text{Measurement\ Period\ \ TDD\ inter}}}{N_{\text{TDD\ inter}}} \cdot N_{\text{Freq}} \right\}\text{ms}$

If the UE does not need compressed mode to perform inter-frequency TDD
measurements, the measurement period for inter-frequency TDD
measurements shall be 480 ms.

The UE shall be capable of performing P-CCPCH RSCP measurements for
X~basic\ measurement\ TDD\ inter~ inter-frequency TDD cells per TDD
frequency of the monitored set and the UE physical layer shall be
capable of reporting measurements to higher layers with the measurement
period of T~measurement\ TDD\ inter~.

X~basic\ measurement\ TDD\ inter~ = 6 (cells)

T~Measurement\_Period\ TDD\ inter~ = 480 ms. The time period used for
calculating the measurement period T~measurement\_TDD\ inter~ for inter
frequency P-CCPCH RSCP measurements.

N~TDD~ ~inter:~ This is the smallest resulting integer number of
transmission gap patterns in a transmission gap pattern sequence
assigned to UE by UTRAN for inter frequency TDD measurements during the
time period T~Measurement\_Period\ TDD\ inter~ with an arbitrarily
chosen timing.

N~basic\_identify\_TDD,inter~ =80. This is the number of transmission
gap patterns in a transmission gap pattern sequence for inter-frequency
TDD measurements during the time period used in the inter frequency TDD
equation where the maximum allowed time for the UE to identify a new
inter frequency TDD cell is defined.

N~basic\_measurement\_TDD\ inter~ = 5. This is the number of
transmission gap patterns in a transmission gap pattern sequence for
inter-frequency TDD measurements during the time period
T~Measurement\_Period\ TDD\ inter~ with an arbitrarily chosen timing
that is used in the inter-frequency TDD equation where the measurement
period for inter-frequency P-CCPCH RSCP measurements is defined.

N~Freq~: This is the number of TDD frequencies indicated in the inter
frequency measurement control information.

##### 8.1.2.4.3 Periodic Reporting

Reported measurements in periodically triggered measurement reports
shall meet the requirements in section 9.

##### 8.1.2.4.4 Event Triggered Reporting

Reported measurements in event triggered measurement reports shall meet
the requirements in section 9.

The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as long as
the reporting criteria are not fulfilled.

The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between any event
that will trigger a measurement report, until the UE starts to transmit
the measurement report over the Uu interface. This requirement assumes
that the measurement report is not delayed by other RRC signalling on
the DCCH.. This measurement reporting delay excludes a delay uncertainty
resulting when inserting the measurement report to the TTI of the uplink
DCCH. The delay uncertainty is twice the TTI of the uplink DCCH.

The event triggered measurement reporting delay, measured without L3
filtering shall be less than T~identify\ TDD\ inter~ defined in Section
8.1.2.4.1 When L3 filtering is used an additional delay can be expected.

#### 8.1.2.5 GSM measurements

The requirements in this section apply only to UE supporting FDD and
GSM.

Measurements on GSM cells can be requested with BSIC verified or BSIC
non-verified.

1\) In CELL\_DCH state when a transmission gap pattern sequence is
provided by the UTRAN the UE shall continuously measure GSM cells and
search for new GSM cells given in the monitored set.

2\) If the UE does not need compressed mode to perform GSM measurements:

\- the UE shall measure all GSM cells present in the monitored set

\- the relevant requirements for GSM dedicated mode when a TCH channel
is assigned in TS 45.008 shall apply. This is further detailed in the
following sub-sections.

##### 8.1.2.5.1 GSM carrier RSSI

1\) For a UE requiring compressed mode

A UE supporting GSM measurements using compressed mode shall meet the
minimum number of GSM RSSI carrier measurements specified in table 8.4.
This measurement shall be based on a transmission gap pattern sequence
with purpose \"GSM carrier RSSI measurements\"

In order for the requirements in this subsection to apply the UTRAN must
provide a transmission gap pattern sequence with measurement purpose GSM
carrier RSSI measurements using the following combinations for TGL1,
TGL2 and TGD:

Table 8.3

  14               14               45...269
  ---------------- ---------------- ---------------

In the CELL\_DCH state the measurement period,
T~Measurement\ Period,\ GSM~, for the GSM carrier RSSI measurement is
480 ms.

The UE shall meet the measurement accuracy requirements stated for RXLEV
in TS45.008, when the given measurement time allows the UE to take at
least 3 GSM carrier RSSI samples per GSM carrier in the monitored set
during the measurement period.

  ----- -------------------------------------------------

In case the UE is not able to acquire the required number of samples per
GSM carrier during one measurement period, the UE shall measure as many
GSM carriers as possible during that measurement period using at least 3
samples per GSM carrier. The GSM carriers that were not measured during
that measurement period shall be measured in the following measurement
periods. This means that, in this particular case, the L1 reporting
period to higher layers of a GSM neighbour can be a multiple of the
measurement period.

2\) For a UE not requiring compressed mode

The samples allocated to each carrier shall as far as possible be
uniformly distributed over each measurement period. At least 3 received
signal level measurement samples are required per RSSI value. The
measurement period is 480 ms.

##### 8.1.2.5.2 BSIC verification

1\) For a UE requiring compressed mode

In order for the requirements in the following subsections to apply the
UTRAN must provide a transmission gap pattern sequence with measurement
purpose GSM Initial BSIC identification or with measurement purpose GSM
BSIC re-confirmation, using the following combinations for TGL1, TGL2
and TGD:

  14               14               45...269
  ---------------- ---------------- ---------------

The procedure for BSIC verification on a GSM cell can be divided into
the following two tasks:

**Initial BSIC identification**

Includes searching for the BSIC and decoding the BSIC for the first time
when there is no knowledge about the relative timing between the FDD and
GSM cell. The UE shall trigger the initial BSIC identification within
the available transmission gap pattern sequence with purpose \"GSM
Initial BSIC identification\". The requirements for Initial BSIC
identification can be found in 8.1.2.5.2.1.

**BSIC re-confirmation**

Tracking and decoding the BSIC of a GSM cell after initial BSIC
identification is performed. The UE shall trigger the BSIC
re-confirmation within the available transmission gap pattern sequence
with purpose \"GSM BSIC re-confirmation\". The requirements for BSIC
re-confirmation can be found in 8.1.2.5.2.2.

Measurements on a GSM cell can be requested with BSIC verified or BSIC
non-verified. If GSM measurements are requested with BSIC verified the
UE shall be able to report the GSM cells with BSIC verified for those
cells where the verification of BSIC has been successful.

If the network requests measurements on a GSM cell with BSIC verified,
the UE shall behave as follows:

\- The UE shall perform GSM carrier RSSI measurements according to
Section 8.1.2.5.1 when ever a transmission gap pattern sequence with the
purposes \"GSM carrier RSSI measurements\" is provided and the UE shall
perform measurement reporting as defined in Section 8.6.7.6 of \[16\].

\- The UE shall perform BSIC identification according to Section
8.1.2.5.2.1 when a \"GSM Initial BSIC identification\" transmission gap
pattern sequence is activated. The UE shall use the last available GSM
carrier RSSI measurement results for arranging GSM cells in signal
strength order for performing BSIC identification.

\- The UE shall perform BSIC re-confirmation according to Section
8.1.2.5.2.2 when a \"GSM BSIC re-confirmation\" transmission gap pattern
sequence is activated.

\- If a \"GSM BSIC re-confirmation\" transmission gap pattern sequence
is not activated in parallel to a \"GSM Initial BSIC identification\"
transmission gap pattern sequence or within one frame from the
deactivation of a \"GSM Initial BSIC identification\" transmission gap
pattern sequence, the BSIC shall be considered to be non-verified after
10s has elapsed after the UE identified the BSIC of the cell..

The UE shall perform event evaluation for event-triggered reporting
after the BSIC has been verified for a GSM cell. The UE shall use the
last available GSM carrier RSSI measurement results in event evaluation
and event-triggered reporting. Periodic reports shall be triggered
according to Sections 8.6.7.5 and 8.6.7.6 of \[16\].

The BSIC of a GSM cell is considered to be \"verified\" if the UE has
decoded the SCH of the BCCH carrier and identified the BSIC at least one
time (initial BSIC identification) and from that moment the BSIC shall
be re-confirmed at least once every T~re-confirm\_abort~ seconds.
Otherwise the BSIC of the GSM cell is considered as \"non-verified\". If
a transmission gap pattern sequence with a purpose \"GSM BSIC
re-confirmation \" is not activated by the network after BSIC identified
or the \"GSM BSIC re-confirmation \" transmission gap pattern sequence
is deactivated, the UE shall behave as described previously in this
section.

The parameters N~identify\_abort~ and T~re-confirm\_abort~ are defined
by higher layers and are signalled to the UE together with the
transmission gap pattern sequence. N~identify\_abort~ indicates the
maximum number of patterns that the UE shall use to attempt to decode
the unknown BSIC of the GSM cell in the initial BSIC identification
procedure. T~re-confirm\_abort~ indicates the maximum time allowed for
the re-confirmation of the BSIC of one GSM cell in the BSIC
re-confirmation procedure.

The UE shall be able to decode a BSIC within a transmission gap when the
time difference between the middle of the received GSM synchronisation
burst at the UE and the middle of the effective transmission gap is
within the limits specified in table 8.6.

The effective transmission gap is calculated by assuming both UL and DL
compressed mode and applying the worst-case values for UL/DL timing
offset and pilot field length of last DL gap slot.

Table 8.6: The gap length and maximum time difference for BSIC
verification

+------------+-------------------------+
| Gap length | Maximum time difference |
|            |                         |
| \[slots\]  | \[μs\]                  |
+------------+-------------------------+
| 5          | ± 500                   |
+------------+-------------------------+
| 7          | ± 1200                  |
+------------+-------------------------+
| 10         | ± 2200                  |
+------------+-------------------------+
| 14         | ± 3500                  |
+------------+-------------------------+

The UE shall be able to perform BSIC verification at levels down to the
reference sensitivity level or reference interference levels as
specified in TS 45.005.

2\) For a UE not requiring compressed mode

If a BSIC is decoded and matches the expected value, it is considered as
\"verified\", else it is considered as \"non verified\".

The UE shall be able to perform BSIC verification at levels down to the
reference sensitivity level or reference interference levels as
specified in TS 45.005.

###### 8.1.2.5.2.1 Initial BSIC identification 

This measurement shall be based on a transmission gap pattern sequence
with the purpose \"GSM Initial BSIC identification\"

For GSM cells that are requested with BSIC verified the UE shall attempt
to decode the SCH on the BCCH carrier of the 8 strongest BCCH carriers
of the GSM cells indicated in the measurement control information. The
UE shall give priority for BSIC decoding attempts in decreasing signal
strength order to BSIC carriers with unknown BSIC. The strongest BCCH
carrier is defined as the BCCH carrier having the highest measured GSM
carrier RSSI value after layer 3 filtering. The GSM signal strength
levels used in BSIC identification for arranging GSM cells in signal
strength order shall be based on the latest GSM carrier RSSI measurement
results available.

When the UE attempts to decode the BSIC of one GSM BCCH carrier with
unknown BSIC, the UE shall use all available transmission gaps, within
the transmission gap pattern sequence with the purpose \"GSM Initial
BSIC identification\", to attempt to decode the BSIC from that GSM BCCH
carrier.

If the BSIC of the GSM BCCH carrier has been successfully decoded the UE
shall immediately continue BSIC identification with the next GSM BCCH
carrier, in signal strength order, with unknown BSIC. The GSM cell for
which the BSIC has been successfully identified shall be moved to the
BSIC re-confirmation procedure.

If the UE has not successfully decoded the BSIC of the GSM BCCH carrier
within N~identify\_abort~ successive patterns, the UE shall abort the
BSIC identification attempts for that GSM BCCH carrier. The UE shall
continue to try to perform BSIC identification of the next GSM BCCH
carrier in signal strength order. The GSM BCCH carrier for which the
BSIC identification failed shall not be re-considered for BSIC
identification until BSIC identification attempts have been made for all
the rest of the 8 strongest GSM BCCH carriers in the monitored set with
unknown BSIC.

N~identify\_abort~ values are given for a set of reference patterns in
table 8.7. T~identify\_abort~ is the elapsed time during
N~identify\_abort~ transmission gap patterns (informative). The figures
given in table 8.7 represent the number of patterns required to
guarantee at least two attempts to decode the BSIC for one GSM BCCH
carrier.

###### 8.1.2.5.2.2 BSIC re-confirmation

The requirements of this section are applicable for BSIC
re-confirmation.

The UE shall maintain the timing information of 8 identified GSM cells.
Initial timing information is obtained from the initial BSIC
identification. The timing information shall be updated every time the
BSIC is decoded.

For each transmission gap of a transmission gap pattern sequence with
the measurement purpose \"GSM BSIC re-confirmation\", the UE shall
attempt to decode the BSIC falling within the effective gap duration. If
more than one BSIC can be decoded within the same gap, priority shall be
given to the least recently decoded BSIC.

If the UE fails to decode the BSIC after two successive attempts or if
the UE has not been able to re-confirm the BSIC for a GSM cell within
T~re-confirm\_abort~ seconds, the UE shall abort the BSIC
re-confirmation attempts for that GSM cell. The GSM cell shall be
treated as a new GSM cell with unidentified BSIC and the GSM cell shall
be moved to the initial BSIC identification procedure, see section
8.1.2.5.2.1. The UE shall be able to make BSIC re-confirmation attempts
for the 8 strongest GSM cells in the monitored list.

N~re-confirm\_abort~ is the number of transmission gap patterns executed
during T~re-confirm\_abort~ (informative).

##### 8.1.2.5.3 Periodic Reporting

Reported measurements in periodically triggered measurement reports
shall meet the requirements in section 9.

##### 8.1.2.5.4 Event Triggered Reporting

Reported measurements in event triggered measurement reports shall meet
the requirements in section 9.

The UE shall not send any event triggered measurement reports, as long
as the reporting criteria is not fulfilled.

The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between any event
that will trigger a measurement report until the UE starts to transmit
the measurement report over the Uu interface. This requirement assumes
that that the measurement report is not delayed by other RRC signalling
on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes a delay
uncertainty resulted when inserting the measurement report to the TTI of
the uplink DCCH . The delay uncertainty is twice the TTI of the uplink
DCCH.

The event triggered reporting delay requirement is valid when the UE for
each GSM carrier in the monitored set can take the required number of
samples during the measurement period T~Measurement\ Period,\ GSM~ (see
section 8.1.2.5.1).

The event triggered measurement reporting delay for a GSM cell with
verified BSIC, measured without L3 filtering shall be less than
2\*T~Measurement\ Period,\ GSM~, where T~Measurement\ Period,\ GSM~ is
defined in Section 8.1.2.5.1. When L3 filtering is used an additional
delay can be expected. For a GSM cell with non-verified BSIC an
additional delay according to section 8.1.2.5.2.1 Initial BSIC
identification can be expected.

#### 8.1.2.6 E-UTRAN measurements

The requirements in this section apply only to UEs supporting UTRAN FDD
and E-UTRAN FDD and TDD.

1\) In CELL\_DCH state when a transmission gap pattern sequence is
provided by the UTRAN the UE shall continuously measure previously
detected E-UTRAN cells and search for new E-UTRAN cells.

> In order for the requirements in the following subsections to apply
> the UTRAN must provide a transmission gap pattern sequence with
> measurement purpose \"E-UTRAN measurement\" using the following
> combinations for TGL1, TGL2, TGD and Max TGPL:

  ≥10              \-               undefined       12
  ---------------- ---------------- --------------- ---------------------

2\) If the UE does not need compressed mode to perform E-UTRAN
measurements:

\- the UE shall measure either all E-UTRAN cells present in the
monitored set or, if only frequencies are provided in the neighbour cell
list, the strongest cells present in the detected set, up to the
monitoring capabilities of the UE.

> \- the relevant requirements for E-UTRAN RRC\_CONNECTED mode specified
> in 3GPP TS 36.133 \[24\] shall apply. This is further detailed in the
> following subclauses.

##### 8.1.2.6.1 Identification of a new cell

When compressed mode gaps are used for E-UTRAN measurements, the UE
shall be able to identify a new detectable E-UTRAN cell within

$T_{\text{Identify,E-UTRAN}} = K_{n} \cdot N_{\text{freq},E - \text{UTRA},n} \cdot T_{\text{Basic\_Identify\_E-UTRAN\ }} \cdot \frac{\text{480}}{T_{\text{E-UTRAN}}}\ \text{ms}$(normal
performance) and

$T_{\text{Identify,E-UTRAN}} = K_{r} \cdot N_{\text{freq},E - \text{UTRA},r} \cdot T_{\text{Basic\_Identify\_E-UTRAN\ }} \cdot \frac{\text{480}}{T_{\text{E-UTRAN}}}\ \text{ms}$(reduced
performance);

If the UE does not need compressed mode to perform E-UTRAN measurements,
the UE shall be able to identify a new detectable E-UTRAN cell within
$T_{\text{Basic\_Identify\_E-UTRAN\ }}$ ms.

Where:

> T~E-UTRAN~: This is the minimum time that is available for E-UTRAN
> measurements during a 480ms period with an arbitrarily chosen timing.
> The minimum time per compressed mode gap is calculated by subtracting
> 2\*0.5 ms from the length of the gap.
>
> N~freq,E-UTRAN~ :This is the number of E-UTRAN carriers being
> monitored
>
> N~freq,E-UTRA,n~ : Number of E-UTRAN carriers to be monitored with
> normal performance
>
> N~freq,E-UTRA,n,FDD~ : Number of E-UTRAN FDD carriers to be monitored
> with normal performance
>
> N~freq,E-UTRA,n,TDD~ : Number of E-UTRAN TDD carriers to be monitored

> N~freq~,~E-UTRA,r~: Number of E-UTRAN carriers to be monitored with
> reduced performance.
>
> If N~freq,E-UTRA,r~ is not equal to zero then K~n~ and K~r~ are as

> =0.
>
> T~Basic\_Identify\_E-UTRAN~ = 480ms

When L3 filtering is used an additional delay can be expected.

> An E-UTRANcell shall be considered detectable when

\- RSRP\|~dBm~ RSRP Ês/Iot according to Annex B.2.1 for a corresponding
Band

\- other RSRP related side condition given in Section 9.1 of \[24\] are
fulfilled[,]{.underline}

\- SCH\_RP\|~dBm~ and SCH\_RP/Iot according to Annex B.2.1 for a
corresponding Band

##### 8.1.2.6.2 E-UTRAN RSRP and RSRQ measurement period

When compressed mode gaps are scheduled for E-UTRAN measurements the UE
physical layer shall be capable of reporting measurements to higher
layers with measurement accuracy as specified in sub-clause 9.1.4a and
9.1.4b with measurement period of T~Measurement\_Period\_E-UTRAN~ =480 x
K~n~ x N~freq,E-UTRA,n~ ms (normal performance) and
T~Measurement\_Period\_E-UTRAN~ =480 x K~r~ x N~freq,E-UTRA,r,~ (reduced
performance) where N~freq,E-UTRA,n~ and N~freq,E-UTRA,r~ are defined in
section 8.1.2.6.

The UE shall be capable of performing RSRP and RSRQ measurements of at
least 4 E-UTRAN cells per E-UTRAN frequency, according to its supported
UE capabilities. Additionally, *for a UE supporting E-UTRA measurements
in Cell-DCH state, the UE shall be capable of monitoring a minimum total
of at least 13 carrier frequency layers, including the intrafrequency
serving layer and comprising of any allowed combination of E-UTRA FDD,
E-UTRA TDD, UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD and GSM layers (one GSM layer corresponds
to 32 cells).*

##### 8.1.2.6.3 Periodic reporting

Reported measurements in periodically triggered measurement reports
shall meet the requirements in section 9.

##### 8.1.2.6.4 Void

##### 8.1.2.6.5 Event Triggered reporting

Reported measurements in event triggered measurement reports shall meet
the requirements in section 9.

The UE shall not send any event triggered measurement reports, as long
as the reporting criteria is not fulfilled.

The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between any event
that will trigger a measurement report until the UE starts to transmit
the measurement report over the Uu interface. This requirement assumes
that the measurement report is not delayed by other RRC signalling on
the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes a delay uncertainty
resulted when inserting the measurement report to the TTI of the uplink
DCCH . The delay uncertainty is twice the TTI of the uplink DCCH.

The event triggered measurement reporting delay, measured without L3
filtering shall be less than T ~identify\ ,E-UTRAN~ defined in Section
8.1.2.6.1When L3 filtering is used an additional delay can be expected.

If a cell has been detectable at least for the time period than T
~identify\ ,E-UTRAN~ and then triggers the measurement report as per TS
25.331, section 14 \[16\], the event triggered measurement reporting
delay shall be less than T~Measurement\_Period\_E-UTRAN~ provided the
timing to that cell has not changed more than ± 50 Ts while transmission
gap has not been available and the L3 filter has not been used.

8.2 Measurements in CELL\_DCH State with special requirements
-------------------------------------------------------------

### 8.2.1 Introduction

This section contains specific requirements for certain measurements
beyond those specified in section 8.1. The measurements are defined in
TS 25.215, the measurement model is defined in TS 25.302 and measurement
accuracies are specified in section 9. As long as the measurement
configuration does not exceed the requirements stated in section 8.2.2,
the UE shall meet the performance requirements defined in section 9.

Control of measurement reporting is specified in TS 25.331. Compressed
mode is specified in TS 25.215.

### 8.2.2 Requirements

The UE shall be able to perform in parallel all physical layer
measurements according to table 8.9. In this section one physical layer
measurement corresponds to a measurement at the reference point B (i.e.
measurement reported by layer 1 after layer 1 filtering) in the
measurement model in TS 25.302 \[15\].

In addition to the requirements in table 8.9 the UE shall in parallel,
in state CELL\_DCH, also be able to measure and report the quantities
according to section 8.1.

8.3 Capabilities for Support of Event Triggering and Reporting Criteria in CELL\_DCH state
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 8.3.1 Introduction

This section contains requirements on UE capabilities for support of
event triggering and reporting criteria. As long as the measurement
configuration does not exceed the requirements stated in section 8.3.2,
the UE shall meet the performance requirements defined in section 9.

The UE can be requested to make measurements under different Measurement
Identities \[16\]. Each Measurement Identity corresponds to either event
based reporting, periodic reporting or no reporting. In case of event
based reporting, each Measurement Identity is associated with one or
more events, each identified with an Event Identity. In case of periodic
reporting, a Measurement Identity is associated with one periodic
reporting criterion. In case of no reporting, a Measurement Identity is
associated with one no reporting criterion.

The purpose of this section is to set some limits on the number of
different event, periodic and no reporting criteria the UE may be
requested to track in parallel.

### 8.3.2 Requirements

In this section a reporting criterion corresponds to either one event
(in the case of event based reporting), or one periodic reporting
criterion (in case of periodic reporting), or one no reporting criterion
(in case of no reporting). For event based reporting, each instance of
event, with the same or different Event Identities, is counted as
separate reporting criterion in Table 8.10.

The UE shall be able to support in parallel per category up to E~cat~
reporting criteria according to Table 8.10. If the UE is configured with
a single uplink carrier frequency, for the measurement categories:
Intra-frequency, Inter frequency, Inter frequency (virtual active set),
and Inter-RAT the UE need not support more than 42 reporting criteria in
total. If the UE is configured with dual uplink carrier frequencies, for
the measurement categories: Intra-frequency, Inter frequency, Inter
frequency (virtual active set), and Inter-RAT the UE need not support
more than 55 reporting criteria in total. For the measurement
categories: Traffic volume and Quality measurements the UE need not
support more than 16 reporting criteria in total.

8.4 Measurements in CELL\_FACH State when HS-DSCH discontinuous reception is not ongoing
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 8.4.1 Introduction

This section contains requirements on the UE regarding cell reselection
and measurement reporting in CELL\_FACH state when HS-DSCH discontinuous
reception is not ongoing. The requirements for cell re-selection are
split in FDD intra frequency, FDD inter frequency, TDD, GSM and E-UTRAN
measurements. The measurements are defined in TS 25.215, the measurement
model is defined in TS 25.302 and measurement accuracies are specified
in section 9. Control of measurement reporting is specified in TS
25.331. Measurement occasions in CELL\_FACH state are described in TS
25.331.

If UE indicates support for Increased UE carrier monitoring UTRA or
increased carrier monitoring E-UTRA the measurement performance for
different carriers may be configured by higher layers to be either
normal or reduced. A measurement scaling factor \[16\] defining the
relaxation to be applied to the requirements for carriers measured with
reduced measurement performance is signalled by higher layers and has
the possible settings shown in table 8.0a. The same measurement scaling
factor mapping is used in Cell FACH state as cell DCH state.

The minimum performance requirements for a UE which indicates support
for Increased UE carrier monitoring UTRA \[16, 31\] are calculated as
defined in section 8.4.2.3 provided that N~freq,\ FDD,n~ ≤2 or if all
FDD interfrequency carriers are indicated to have normal performance.
The minimum performance requirements for a UE which indicates support
for Increased UE carrier monitoring E-UTRA \[16, 31\] are calculated as
defined in section 8.4.2.6 provided that N~E-UTRA,n~≤4 *for a UE capable
of either FDD E-UTRA carrier monitoring or TDD E-UTRA carrier*
monitoring or N~freq,E-UTRA,n~≤8 *for a UE capable of both FDD and TDD
E-UTRA carrier monitoring provided* N~freq,E-UTRA,n,FDD~≤4 *and*
N~freq,E-UTRA,n,TDD~≤4 or if all E-UTRA carriers are indicated to have
normal performance.

Capabilities for number of carriers to monitor for UE which indicates
support for Increased UE carrier monitoring UTRA or E-UTRA are specified
in section 8.4.2.1a.

### 8.4.2 Requirements

#### 8.4.2.1 UE Measurement Capability when HS-DSCH discontinuous reception is not ongoing

In CELL\_FACH state, the UE shall be able to monitor up to

\- 32 intra frequency FDD cells and

\- 32 inter frequency cells, including

> \- FDD cells distributed on up to 2 additional FDD carriers and
>
> \- Depending on UE Capability, TDD mode cells, distributed on up to 3
> TDD carriers, and

\- Depending on UE capability, 32 GSM cells distributed on up to 32 GSM
carriers, and

\- Depending on UE capability, up to 4 E-UTRA FDD carriers, and

\- Depending on UE capability up to 4 E-UTRA TDD carriers, and

\- Depending on UE capability, the UE shall be able to monitor up to 16
intra frequency cells during IPDL gaps.

The requirements in section 9 on CPICH Ec/Io and RSCP measurements are
applicable for a UE performing measurements according to this section.
For inter-frequency FDD, TDD, GSM and E-UTRAN cell re-selection,
measurement occasions as specified in TS 25.331 are used to find and
measure on other cells.

It is defined below how the measurements on different systems and modes
are performed given the time allocated to that system. The requirements
in this section are based on an assumption that the time during the
measurement occasions that is allocated to each of the different modes
and systems shall be equally shared by the modes which the UE has
capability for and that are in the monitored set signalled by the
network.

For this four parameters are defined:

*N~FDD~* is 0 or 1. If there are inter-frequency FDD cells in the
neighbour list and FDD measurements are required by higher layers,
*N~FDD~=*1, otherwise *N~FDD~=*0.

*N~TDD~* is 0 or 1. If the UE is capable of TDD and there are TDD cells
in the neighbour list and TDD measurements are required by higher
layers, *N~TDD~=1* otherwise *N~TDD ~*=0.

*N~GSM~* is 0 or 1. If the UE is capable of GSM and there are GSM cells
in the neighbour list and GSM measurements are required by higher
layers, *N~GSM~=1,* otherwise *N~GSM\ ~*=0.

*N~E-UTRAN~* is 0 or 1. If the UE is capable of E-UTRAN and there are
E-UTRAN cells in the neighbour list and E-UTRAN measurements are
required by higher layers, *N~E-UTRAN~*=1, otherwise *N~E-UTRAN~* =0.

The measurement time T~meas~ is then defined as

$T_{\text{meas}} = \left\lbrack \left( N_{\text{FDD}} + N_{\text{TDD}} + N_{\text{GSM}} + \ N_{E - \text{UTRAN}} \right) \cdot N_{\text{TTI}} \cdot \text{M\_REP} \cdot \text{10} \right\rbrack$ms

where

\- M\_REP is the Measurement Occasion cycle length where K is given in
Table 8.10A. K is the FACH measurement occasion length coefficient as
specified in TS25.331

\- The FACH Measurement Occasion of N~TTI~ frames will be repeated every
N~TTI~ \* M\_REP frame.

\- N~TTI~ is the number of frames in each measurement occasion, equal to
the length of the largest TTI on the SCCPCH monitored by the UE. *FACHs
that only carry MBMS logical channels (MTCH, MSCH, or MCCH) are excluded
from measurement occasion calculations.*

*- A UE receiving MTCH shall use only that part of the Measurement
Occasion of NTTI frames which corresponds to 25% of the MTCH TTI length
at the maximum.*

*For UEs receiving MTCH, the reduced measurement time, if applicable,
needs to be considered when performance requirements are derived

#### 8.4.2.5 GSM measurements when HS-DSCH discontinuous reception is not ongoing

The requirements in this section apply only to UE supporting FDD and
GSM. If E-DCH resources are allocated to the UE or timer T321\[16\] is
running, the UE is not required to perform GSM BSIC identification or
RSSI measurement.

To support cell reselection the UE shall always perform BSIC
verification in Cell FACH state.

1\) In CELL\_FACH state when measurement occasions are provided by the
UTRAN the UE shall continuously measure GSM cells and search for new GSM
cells given in the monitored set.

In section 8.4.2.1 the split of measurements between different modes and
systems is defined. Every second measurement occasion scheduled for GSM
measurements, as given by 8.4.2.1 shall be allocated for GSM initial
BSIC identification.

The remaining measurements occasions scheduled for GSM measurements
shall be used as follows. 3 occasions out of 4 shall be allocated for
GSM carrier RSSI measurements and 1 out of 4 shall be allocated for GSM
BSIC reconfirmation. The scheduling of measurement occasions between GSM
carrier RSSI measurements and GSM BSIC reconfirmation is up to the UE.

2\) If the UE does not need measurement occasions to perform GSM
measurements:

\- the UE shall measure all GSM cells present in the monitored set

\- the relevant requirements for GSM dedicated mode when a TCH channel
is assigned in TS 45.008 shall apply. This is further detailed in the
following sub-sections.

##### 8.4.2.5.1 GSM carrier RSSI

1\) For a UE requiring measurement occasions.

A UE supporting GSM measurements using measurement occasions shall meet
the minimum number of GSM carrier RSSI measurements specified in Table
8.11. This measurement shall be based on measurement occasions allocated
for GSM carrier RSSI measurements as described in 8.4.2.5. In the
CELL\_FACH state the measurement period for the GSM carrier RSSI
measurement is 480 ms.

The UE shall meet the measurement accuracy requirements stated for RXLEV
in TS 45.008, when the given measurement time allows the UE to take at
least 3 GSM carrier RSSI samples per GSM carrier in the monitored set
during the measurement period.

Table 8.11

  ----------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Length of measurement occasion (frames)   Number of GSM carrier RSSI samples in each measurement occasion, N~GSM\ carrier\ RSSI~.
  1                                         16
  2                                         32
  4                                         64
  8                                         128
  ----------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In case the UE is not able to acquire the required number of samples per
GSM carrier during one measurement period, the UE shall measure as many
GSM carriers as possible during that measurement period using at least 3
samples per GSM carrier. The GSM carriers that were not measured during
that measurement period shall be measured in the following measurement
periods.

2\) For a UE not requiring measurement occasions

The samples allocated to each carrier shall as far as possible be
uniformly distributed over each measurement period. At least 3 received
signal level measurement samples are required per RSSI value. The
measurement period is 480 ms.

In case UTRA RACH procedure prevents the UE from acquiring the required
number of samples per GSM carrier during one measurement period, the GSM
carriers that were not measured during that measurement period shall be
measured in the following measurement periods.

##### 8.4.2.5.2 BSIC verification

1\) For a UE requiring measurement occasions.

The procedure for BSIC verification on a GSM cell can be divided into
the following two tasks:

Initial BSIC identification\
Includes searching for the BSIC and decoding the BSIC for the first time
when there is no knowledge about the relative timing between the FDD and
GSM cell. The UE shall trigger the initial BSIC identification within
50% of the available measurement occasions used for GSM measurements as
specified in 8.4.2.1. The requirements for Initial BSIC identification
can be found in 8.4.2.5.2.1.

BSIC re-confirmation\
Tracking and decoding the BSIC of a GSM cell after initial BSIC
identification is performed. The UE shall trigger the BSIC
re-confirmation within the available measurement occasions used for GSM
as specified in 8.4.2.1. The requirements for BSIC re-confirmation can
be found in 8.4.2.5.2.2.

The BSIC of a GSM cell is considered to be \"verified\" if the UE has
decoded the SCH of the BCCH carrier and identified the BSIC at least one
time (initial BSIC identification) and from that moment the BSIC shall
be re-confirmed at least once every 6 times T~re-confirm\_GSM~ seconds.
Otherwise the BSIC of the GSM cell is considered as \"non-verified\".

T~re-confirm\_GSM~ indicates the maximum time allowed for the
re-confirmation of the BSIC of one GSM cell in the BSIC re-confirmation
procedure according to section 8.4.2.5.2.2.

The UE shall be able to decode a BSIC within a measurement occasion when
the time difference between the middle of the received GSM
synchronisation burst at the UE and the middle of the measurement
occasion is within the limits specified in table 8.12.

Table 8.12: The measurement occasion length and maximum time difference
for BSIC verification

+---------------------------------------+-------------------------+
| Measurement occasion length (frames\] | Maximum time difference |
|                                       |                         |
|                                       | \[μs\]                  |
+---------------------------------------+-------------------------+

+---------------------------------------+-------------------------+
| 8                                     | ± 39100                 |
+---------------------------------------+-------------------------+

The UE shall be able to perform BSIC verification at levels down to the
reference sensitivity level or reference interference levels as
specified in TS 45.005.

2\) For a UE not requiring measurement occasions

The UE shall attempt to check the BSIC for at least the 6 strongest GSM
carriers at least every 10 seconds, to confirm that it is monitoring the
same cell, as far as UTRA RACH procedure does not prevent UE from
decoding BSIC.

If a BSIC is decoded and matches the expected value, it is considered as
\"verified\", else it is considered as \"non verified\".

The UE shall be able to perform BSIC verification at levels down to the
reference sensitivity level or reference interference levels as
specified in TS 45.005.

###### 8.4.2.5.2.1 Initial BSIC identification 

This measurement shall be based on the measurement occasions allocated
for Initial BSIC identification as described in 8.4.2.5.

The UE shall continuously attempt to decode the BSIC of SCH on the BCCH
carrier of the 6 strongest BCCH carriers of the GSM cells indicated in
the Inter-RAT cell info list. The UE shall give priority for BSIC
decoding attempts in decreasing signal strength order to BCCH carriers
with unknown BSIC. The strongest BCCH carrier is defined as the BCCH
carrier having the highest measured GSM carrier RSSI value.

When the UE attempts to decode the BSIC of one GSM BCCH carrier with
unknown BSIC, the UE shall use all available measurements occasions
allocated for GSM initial BSIC identification according section 8.4.2.5
to attempt to decode the BSIC from that GSM BCCH carrier.

If the BSIC of the GSM BCCH carrier has been successfully decoded the UE
shall immediately continue BSIC identification with the next GSM BCCH
carrier, in signal strength order, with unknown BSIC. The GSM cell for
which the BSIC has been successfully identified shall be moved to the
BSIC re-confirmation procedure.

If the UE has not successfully decoded the BSIC of the GSM BCCH carrier
within T~identify,\ GSM~ ms, the UE shall abort the BSIC identification
attempts for that GSM BCCH carrier. The UE shall continue to try to
perform BSIC identification of the next GSM BCCH carrier in signal
strength order. The GSM BCCH carrier for which the BSIC identification
failed shall not be re-considered for BSIC identification until BSIC
identification attempts have been made for all the rest of the 6
strongest GSM BCCH carriers in the monitored set with unknown BSIC.

T~identify\_GSM~ is given for the combinations of T~meas~ and N~TTI~
that are given in table 8.13. The values given in table 8.13 represent
the number of patterns required to guarantee at least two attempts to
decode the BSIC for one GSM BCCH carrier.

###### 8.4.2.5.2.2 BSIC re-confirmation

The requirements of this section are applicable for BSIC
re-confirmation.

The UE shall maintain the timing information of 6 identified GSM cells.
Initial timing information is obtained from the initial BSIC
identification. The timing information shall be updated every time the
BSIC is decoded.

For each measurement occasion allocated for GSM BSIC reconfirmation as
described in 8.4.2.5, the UE shall attempt to decode the BSIC falling
within the measurement occasion duration according to table 8.12. When
the UE has to select one out of several possible GSM cells to reconfirm
within the possible allocation of measurement occasions, according to
8.4.2.5, priority shall be given to the least recently decoded BSIC.

If the UE fails to decode the BSIC after two successive attempts the UE
shall abort the BSIC re-confirmation attempts for that GSM cell. The GSM
cell shall be treated as a new GSM cell with unidentified BSIC and the
GSM cell shall be moved to the initial BSIC identification procedure,
see section 8.4.2.5.2.1. The UE shall be able to make BSIC
re-confirmation attempts for the 6 strongest GSM cells in the monitored
list.

T~re-confirm\_GSM~ is given for the combinations of T~meas~ and N~TTI~
that are given in table 8.14. The values given in table 8.14 represent
the number of patterns required to guarantee at least two attempts to
decode the BSIC for one GSM BCCH carrier. Different values for
T~re-confirm\ GSM~ might apply when more than one GSM cell is in the
BSIC reconfirmation procedure at the same time.

#### 8.4.2.6 E-UTRAN measurements when HS-DSCH discontinuous reception is not ongoing

The requirements in this section apply only to UE supporting FDD and
E-UTRA.

When absolute priority based reselection is used, measurement rules
defined in \[1\] apply (based on S~prioritysearch1~ and
S~prioritysearch2~ thresholds)

If E-DCH resources are allocated to the UE or timer T321\[16\] is
running, the UE is not required to perform E-UTRA measurements.

The requirements below apply to both cell reselection to E-UTRA and
network controlled mobility to E-UTRA (i.e. E-UTRA measurement for
CELL\_FACH and E-UTRA RACH reporting).

##### 8.4.2.6.1 Identification of a new cell

The UE shall be able to identify a new detectable cell belonging to the
monitored set within

$T_{\text{identify,}\ \text{\ E-UTRAN}} = \text{Ceil}\left\{ \frac{T_{\text{basic}\ \text{identify}\ \text{E-UTRAN}}}{T_{\text{E-UTRAN\ FACH}}} \right\} \cdot T_{\text{meas}} \cdot K_{n} \cdot N_{E - \text{UTRA},n}\ \text{ms}$(normal
performance) and

$T_{\text{identify,}\ \text{\ E-UTRAN}} = \text{Ceil}\left\{ \frac{T_{\text{basic}\ \text{identify}\ \text{E-UTRAN}}}{T_{\text{E-UTRAN\ FACH}}} \right\} \cdot T_{\text{meas}} \cdot K_{r} \cdot N_{E - \text{UTRA},r}\ \text{ms}$
(reduced performance)

where

T~basic\_identify\_E-UTRAN~ is specified in 8.1.2.6.

N~E-UTRA~: Number of E-UTRA frequencies in the E-UTRA cell info list

> N~E-UTRA,n~ : Number of E\_UTRAN carriers to be monitored with normal
> performance
>
> N~E-UTRA,r~: Number of E-UTRAN carriers to be monitored with reduced
> performance.
>
> If N~E-UTRA,r~ is not equal to zero then K~n~ and K~r~ are as shown in
> table 8.0a. Otherwise K~n~=1 and all E-UTRA layers have normal
> performance.

> such UE, are having normal performance and are in normal performance
> group, i.e. N~E-UTRA,\ n~ = N~E-UTRA~ and N~E-UTRA,\ r~=0.

T~Meas~ and M\_REP are specified in 8.4.2.1.

T~E-UTRAN\ FACH~ = (N~TTI~\*10 - 2\*0.5) ms

A cell shall be considered detectable based on requirements defined in
\[24\].

##### 8.4.2.6.2 UE RSRP and RSRQ measurement capability

When a measurement occasion cycle is scheduled for E-UTRA measurements
the UE physical layer shall be capable of reporting measurements to
higher layers with measurement accuracy as specified in sub-clause
9.1.4a/b with measurement period given by

$T_{\text{measurement}\ \text{\ E-UTRAN}} = \text{Max}\left\{ T_{\text{Measurement\_Period\ E-UTRAN}},2 \cdot T_{\text{meas}},\text{Ceil}\left\{ \frac{T_{\text{basic}\ \text{measurement}\ \text{E-UTRAN}}}{T_{\text{E-UTRAN\ FACH}}} \right\} \cdot K_{n} \cdot T_{\text{meas}} \cdot N \right\}$ms
(normal performance), and

where

T~basic\_measurement\_E-UTRAN~ = 60 ms.

T~Measurement\_Period\ E-UTRAN~ is specified in section 8.1.2.6.

T~Meas~ is specified in section 8.4.2.1.

N~E-UTRA,n,~ N~E-UTRA,r,~ K~n~ and K~r~ and T~E-UTRAN\ FACH~ are
specified in section 8.4.2.6.1

If the UE does not need measurement occasions to perform E-UTRA
measurements, the measurement period for E-UTRA measurements is 480 ms.

##### 8.4.2.6.3 E-UTRA measurements reporting

If E-UTRA measurement for CELL\_FACH is configured by upper layers, UE
can report measurements in measurement reports, whose report criteria
can be set to Event triggered or Periodical reporting. In both cases,
the UE shall send only one measurement report. The UE shall be able to
support at least 1 E-UTRA measurement per carrier on up to 4 E-UTRA
carriers for CELL\_FACH configuration.

Reported measurements shall meet the requirements in section 9.

##### 8.4.2.6.3.1 Event Triggered reporting {#event-triggered-reporting-5 .H6}

The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between the
triggering of a measurement report (the measured quality of any cell on
a configured E-UTRA frequency exceeds the configured threshold) until
the moment in time when the UE starts sending the preambles on the PRACH
for sending the measurement report

The event triggered measurement reporting delay shall be less than T
~identify\ ,E-UTRAN~ + T~RA~, where T ~identify\ ,E-UTRAN~ is defined in
Section 8.4.2.6.1 and T~RA~ is the additional delay caused by the random
access procedure.

If a cell has been detectable at least for the time period than T
~identify\ ,E-UTRAN~ and then triggers the measurement report, the event
triggered measurement reporting delay shall be less than
T~Measurement\_Period\_E-UTRAN~ + T~RA~ provided the timing to that cell
has not changed more than ± 50 Ts while transmission gap has not been
available.

8.4a Measurements in CELL\_FACH State when HS-DSCH discontinuous reception is ongoing
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 8.4a.1 Introduction

This section contains requirements on the UE regarding cell reselection
and measurement reporting in CELL\_FACH state when HS-DSCH discontinuous
reception is ongoing. The requirements for cell re-selection are split
in FDD intra frequency, FDD inter frequency, TDD, GSM and E-UTRA
measurements. The measurements are defined in TS 25.215, the measurement
model is defined in TS 25.302 and measurement accuracies are specified
in section 9. Control of measurement reporting is specified in TS
25.331. DRX in CELL\_FACH state is described in TS 25.331.

If UE indicates support for increased UE carrier monitoring UTRA or
increased carrier monitoring E-UTRA the measurement performance for
different carriers may be configured by higher layers to be either
normal or reduced. A measurement scaling factor \[16\] defining the
relaxation to be applied to the requirements for carriers measured with
reduced measurement performance is signalled by higher layers and has
the possible settings shown in table 8.0a. The same measurement scaling
factor mapping is used in Cell FACH state as cell DCH state.

The minimum performance requirements for a UE which indicates support
for Increased UE carrier monitoring UTRA \[16, 31\] are calculated as
defined in section 8.4a.2.3 provided that N~freq,\ FDD,n~ ≤2 or if all
FDD interfrequency carriers are indicated to have normal performance.
The minimum performance requirements for a UE which indicates support
for Increased UE carrier monitoring E-UTRA \[16, 31\] are calculated as
defined in section 8.4a.2.6 provided that N~E-UTRA,n~≤4 *for a UE
capable of either FDD E-UTRA carrier monitoring or TDD E-UTRA carrier
monitoring* or N~freq,E-UTRA,n~≤8 *for a UE capable of both FDD and TDD
E-UTRA carrier monitoring provided* N~freq,E-UTRA,n,FDD~≤4 *and*
N~freq,E-UTRA,n,TDD~≤4 or if all E-UTRA carriers are indicated to have
normal performance.

Capabilities for number of carriers to monitor for UE which indicates
support for Increased UE carrier monitoring UTRA or E-UTRA are specified
in section 8.4.2.1a.

### 8.4a.2 Requirements

#### 8.4a.2.1 UE Measurement Capability

In CELL\_FACH state, the number of cells the UE shall be able to monitor
is defined in section 8.4.2.1 and 8.4.2.1a.

The requirements in section 9 on CPICH Ec/Io and RSCP measurements are
applicable for a UE performing measurements according to this section.
For inter-frequency FDD, TDD, GSM and E-UTRAN cell re-selection, DRX
gaps as specified in TS 25.331 are used to find and measure on other
cells.

It is defined below how the measurements on different systems and modes
are performed given the time allocated to that system. The requirements
in this section are based on an assumption that the time during the DRX
gaps that is allocated to each of the different modes and systems shall
be equally shared by the modes which the UE has capability for and that
are in the monitored set signalled by the network.

#### 8.4a.2.2 FDD intra frequency measurements when HS-DSCH discontinuous reception is ongoing

During the CELL\_FACH state the UE shall continuously measure identified
intra frequency cells and search for new intra frequency cells in the
monitoring set during the on part of the DRX cycle.

##### 8.4a.2.2.1 Identification of a new cell

The UE shall be able to identify a new detectable cell belonging to the
monitored set within

$T_{\text{identify},\text{\ intra}} = \text{Min}\left\{ \text{30000},\text{Max}\left\{ \text{300,ceil}\left\{ \frac{T_{\text{basic}\ \text{identify}\ \text{FDD,\ intra\_HS-DSCH-DRX}}}{T_{\text{on}}} \right\} T_{\text{DRX\_Cycle}} \right\} \right\}$where

$T_{\text{basic}\ \text{identify}\ \text{FDD,\ intra\_HS-DSCH-DRX}}$ is
300ms

***HS-DSCH Rx burst~FACH~*** is the duration of the on part of the DRX
cycle (frames)

***HS-DSCH DRX cycle~FACH~*** is the duration of the total DRX cycle
(frames)

A cell shall be considered detectable when

\- CPICH Ec/Io [\>]{.underline} -17 dB,

\- SCH\_Ec/Io [\>]{.underline} -17 dB for at least one channel tap and
SCH\_Ec/Ior is equally divided between primary synchronisation code and
secondary synchronisation code.

##### 8.4a.2.2.2 UE CPICH measurement capability 

In the CELL\_FACH state the measurement period for intra frequency
measurements is

$T_{\text{Measurement\_Period\ Intra}}$$= \text{Min}\left\{ \text{10240},\text{Max}\left\{ \text{200,ceil}\left\{ \frac{\text{200}}{T_{\text{on}}} \right\} T_{\text{DRX\_Cycle}} \right\} \right\}$ms

The UE shall be capable of performing CPICH measurements for 8
identified intra-frequency cells of the monitored set and the UE
physical layer shall be capable of reporting measurements to higher
layers with the measurement period of T~Measurent\_Period,Intra~.

where

***HS-DSCH Rx burst~FACH~*** is the duration of the on part of the DRX
cycle (frames)

***HS-DSCH DRX cycle~FACH\ ~*** is the duration of the total DRX cycle
(frames)

##### 8.4a.2.2.3 RACH reporting

Reporting measurements in the measurement reports sent on the RACH shall
meet the requirements in section 9.

#### 8.4a.2.3 FDD inter frequency measurements

In the CELL\_FACH state when DRX is being performed by the UE, the UE
shall measure identified inter frequency cells and search for new inter
frequency cells indicated in the measurement control information,
according to the measurement rules defined in \[1\].

When absolute priority based reselection is used:

\- If Srxlev~ServingCell~ \> S~prioritysearch1~ and Squal~ServingCell~
\> S~prioritysearch2~ then the UE shall search for inter frequency
layers of higher priority at least every T~higher\_priority\_search~
,where T~higher\_priority\_search~ is described in section 4.2.2.

\- If Srxlev~ServingCell~ \<= S~prioritysearch1~ or Squal~ServingCell~
\<= S~prioritysearch2~ then the UE shall search for all inter frequency
layers based on the requirements below.

If E-DCH resources are allocated to the UE or timer T321 \[16\] is
running, the UE is not required to perform interfrequency cell
identification or measurements as continuous HS-DSCH reception is
required.

##### 8.4a.2.3.1 Identification of a new cell

The UE shall be able to identify a new detectable cell belonging to the
monitored set within

$T_{\text{identify,}\ \text{\ inter}} = \text{Min}\left\{ \text{30000},\text{Ceil}\left\{ \frac{T_{\text{basic}\ \text{identify}\ \text{FDD\ inter}}}{T_{\text{Inter\ FACH,DRX}}} \right\} \cdot T_{\text{scale}} \cdot T_{\text{DRX\_Cycle}} \right\} \cdot K_{n} \cdot N_{\text{Freq},\text{FDD},n}\ \text{ms}$
(normal performance) and

$T_{\text{identify,}\ \text{\ inter}} = \text{Min}\left\{ \text{30000},\text{Ceil}\left\{ \frac{T_{\text{basic}\ \text{identify}\ \text{FDD\ inter}}}{T_{\text{Inter\ FACH,DRX}}} \right\} \cdot T_{\text{scale}} \cdot T_{\text{DRX\_Cycle}} \right\} \cdot K_{r} \cdot N_{\text{Freq},\text{FDD},r}\ \text{ms}$(reduced
performance)

where

T~basic\_identify\_FDD,inter~ is specified in 8.1.2.3.2.

#### 8.4a.2.5 GSM measurements when HS-DSCH discontinuous reception is ongoing

The requirements in this section apply only to UE supporting FDD and
GSM. If E-DCH resources are allocated to the UE or timer T321\[16\] is
running, the UE is not required to perform GSM BSIC identification or
RSSI measurement.

To support cell reselection the UE shall always perform BSIC
verification in Cell FACH state.

##### 8.4a.2.5.1 GSM carrier RSSI 

A UE supporting GSM measurements shall be able to measure at least 32
GSM cells and shall be able to obtain RSSI samples of these cells during
a DRX off period. In the CELL\_FACH state the measurement period for the
GSM carrier RSSI measurement is

T~measurement\_period,GSM~=min(30720,max(480ms,T~scale~\*T~DRX~\_~CYCLE~\*6)).

The UE shall meet the measurement accuracy requirements stated for RXLEV
in TS 45.008, when the given measurement time allows the UE to take at
least 3 GSM carrier RSSI samples per GSM carrier in the monitored set
during the measurement period.

In case UTRA RACH procedure prevents the UE from acquiring the required
number of samples per GSM carrier during one measurement period, the GSM
carriers that were not measured during that measurement period shall be
measured in the following measurement periods.

##### 8.4a.2.5.2 BSIC verification 

The procedure for BSIC verification on a GSM cell can be divided into
the following two tasks:

Initial BSIC identification\
Includes searching for the BSIC and decoding the BSIC for the first time
when there is no knowledge about the relative timing between the FDD and
GSM cell. The requirements for Initial BSIC identification can be found
in 8.4a.2.5.2.1.

BSIC re-confirmation\
Tracking and decoding the BSIC of a GSM cell after initial BSIC
identification is performed. The requirements for BSIC re-confirmation
can be found in 8.4s.2.5.2.2.

The BSIC of a GSM cell is considered to be \"verified\" if the UE has
decoded the SCH of the BCCH carrier and identified the BSIC at least one
time (initial BSIC identification) and from that moment the BSIC shall
be re-confirmed at least once every 30 seconds. Otherwise the BSIC of
the GSM cell is considered as \"non-verified\".

The UE shall be able to decode a BSIC within a measurement occasion when
the time difference between the middle of the received GSM
synchronisation burst at the UE and the middle of the measurement
occasion is within TBD.

The UE shall be able to perform BSIC verification at levels down to the
reference sensitivity level or reference interference levels as
specified in TS 45.005.

###### 8.4a.2.5.2.1 Initial BSIC identification 

The UE shall continuously attempt to decode the BSIC of SCH on the BCCH
carrier of the 6 strongest BCCH carriers of the GSM cells indicated in
the Inter-RAT cell info list. The UE shall give priority for BSIC
decoding attempts in decreasing signal strength order to BCCH carriers
with unknown BSIC. The strongest BCCH carrier is defined as the BCCH
carrier having the highest measured GSM carrier RSSI value.

If the BSIC of the GSM BCCH carrier has been successfully decoded the UE
shall immediately continue BSIC identification with the next GSM BCCH
carrier, in signal strength order, with unknown BSIC. The GSM cell for
which the BSIC has been successfully identified shall be moved to the
BSIC re-confirmation procedure.

The UE is required to decode the BSIC within T~identify\_GSM,DRX~ =500ms
for all DRX cycles. This value guarantees at least two attempts to
decode the BSIC for one GSM BCCH carrier.

If the UE has not successfully decoded the BSIC of the GSM BCCH carrier
within T~identify\_GSM,DRX~ =500 ms, the UE shall abort the BSIC
identification attempts for that GSM BCCH carrier. The UE shall continue
to try to perform BSIC identification of the next GSM BCCH carrier in
signal strength order. The GSM BCCH carrier for which the BSIC
identification failed shall not be re-considered for BSIC identification
until BSIC identification attempts have been made for all the rest of
the 6 strongest GSM BCCH carriers in the monitored set with unknown
BSIC. Additionally, the UE is not required to attempt to decode the BSIC
of a GSM carrier for a period of 30 seconds after an unsuccessful
decoding attempt has been made on that GSM carrier.

###### 8.4a.2.5.2.2 BSIC re-confirmation 

The requirements of this section are applicable for BSIC
re-confirmation.

The UE shall maintain the timing information of 6 identified GSM cells.
Initial timing information is obtained from the initial BSIC
identification. The timing information shall be updated every time the
BSIC is decoded.

If the UE fails to decode the BSIC after two successive attempts the UE
shall abort the BSIC re-confirmation attempts for that GSM cell. The GSM
cell shall be treated as a new GSM cell with unidentified BSIC and the
GSM cell shall be moved to the initial BSIC identification procedure,
see section 8.4a.2.5.2.1. The UE shall be able to make BSIC
re-confirmation attempts for the 6 strongest GSM cells in the monitored
list.

The UE shall perform BSIC re-confirmation at least every
T~re-confirm\_GSM,DRX~ =30 seconds.

#### 8.4a.2.6 E-UTRA measurements when HS-DSCH discontinuous reception is ongoing

In the CELL\_FACH state when DRX is being performed by the UE, the UE
shall measure identified E-UTRAN cells and search for new E-UTRAN cells
indicated in the measurement control information, according to the
measurement rules defined in \[1\].

When absolute priority based reselection is used:

\- If Srxlev~ServingCell~ \> S~prioritysearch1~ and Squal~ServingCell~
\> S~prioritysearch2~ then the UE shall search for E-UTRA layers of
higher priority at least every T~higher\_priority\_search~ where
T~higher\_priority\_search~ is described in section 4.2.2.

\- If Srxlev~ServingCell~ \<= S~prioritysearch1~ or Squal~ServingCell~
\<= S~prioritysearch2~ then the UE shall search for all E-UTRA layers
based on the requirements below.

If E-DCH resources are allocated to the UE or timer T321 \[16\] is
running, the UE is not required to perform E-UTRAN cell identification
or measurements as continuous HS-DSCH reception is required.

The requirements below apply to both cell reselection to E-UTRA and
network controlled mobility to E-UTRA (i.e. E-UTRA measurement for
CELL\_FACH and E-UTRA RACH reporting).

##### 8.4a.2.6.1 Identification of a new cell

can report measurements in measurement reports, whose report criteria
can be set to Event triggered or Periodical reporting. In both cases,
the UE shall send only one measurement report. The UE shall be able to

carriers for CELL\_FACH configuration.

Reported measurements shall meet the requirements in section 9.

##### 8.4a.2.6.3.1 Event Triggered reporting {#a.2.6.3.1-event-triggered-reporting .H6}

for sending the measurement report

The event triggered measurement reporting delay shall be less than T
~identify\ ,E-UTRAN~ + T~RA~, where T ~identify\ ,E-UTRAN~ is defined in
Section 8.4.2.6.1 and T~RA~ is the additional delay caused by the random
access procedure.

triggered measurement reporting delay shall be less than
T~Measurement\_Period\_E-UTRAN~ + T~RA~ provided the timing to that cell

8.5 Capabilities for Support of Event Triggering and Reporting Criteria in CELL\_FACH state
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 8.5.1 Introduction

This section contains requirements on UE capabilities for support of
event triggering and reporting criteria.

### 8.5.2 Requirements

In this section reporting criteria can be either event triggered
reporting criteria or periodic reporting criteria.

Table 8.15: Requirements for reporting criteria per measurement category

  ----------------------------- ------------------------------ ----------------------------------------------------
  Measurement category          E~cat~                         Note
  Traffic volume measurements   2 per transport channel type   The transport channel types are "E-DCH" and "RACH"
  ----------------------------- ------------------------------ ----------------------------------------------------

9 Measurements Performance Requirements
=======================================

One of the key services provided by the physical layer is the
measurement of various quantities which are used to trigger or perform a
multitude of functions. Both the UE and the UTRAN are required to
perform a variety of measurements. The physical layer measurement model
and a complete list of measurements is specified in TS 25.302 \"Services
Provided by Physical Layer\". The physical layer measurements for FDD
are described and defined in TS25.215 \"Physical layer ‑ Measurements
(FDD)\". In this clause for each measurement the relevant requirements
on the measurement period, reporting range, granularity and performance
in terms of accuracy are specified.

Since the UE reference sensitivity requirements are different depending
on supported band, this is noted in each case with definition of the
range Io for each frequency band. Definitions of each frequency bands
can be found in TS 25.101.

The accuracy requirements in this clause are applicable for AWGN radio
propagation conditions.

9.1 Measurement Performance for UE
----------------------------------

The requirements in this clause are applicable for a UE:

\- in state CELL\_DCH and/or state CELL\_FACH when DRX is not
configured.

\- performing measurements according to section 8.

\- that is synchronised to the cell that is measured.

The reported measurement result after layer 1 filtering shall be an
estimate of the average value of the measured quantity over the
measurement period. The reference point for the measurement result after
layer 1 filtering is referred to as point B in the measurement model
described in TS25.302.

The accuracy requirements in this clause are valid for the reported
measurement result after layer 1 filtering. The accuracy requirements
are verified from the measurement report at point D in the measurement
model having the layer 3 filtering disabled.

NOTE: It needs to be clarified how the accuracy requirements shall be
handled when the UE is measuring on cells using IPDL.

NOTE: For the UE which supports both Band III and Band IX operating
frequencies, the measurement performance requirements for Band III shall
apply to the multi-band UE.

When DRX is configured in state CELL\_FACH, the accuracy specified for
idle mode reselections in chapter 4 is applicable to UE measurements.

NOTE: The requirements for Band XXXII are applicable only with dual band
configuration (e.g., DB-DC-HSDPA or dual band 4C-HSDPA).

### 9.1.1 CPICH RSCP

NOTE: This measurement is for handover evaluation, DL open loop power
control, UL open loop power control and for the calculation of pathloss.

#### 9.1.1.1 Intra frequency measurements accuracy

The measurement period for CELL\_DCH state can be found in sub clause
8.1.2.2. The measurement period for CELL\_FACH state can be found in sub
clause 8.4.2.2.

##### 9.1.1.1.1 Absolute accuracy requirement

The accuracy requirements in table 9.1 are valid under the following
conditions:

CPICH\_RSCP1\|~dBm~.according to Annex B.3.1 for a corresponding Band

$\frac{I_{o}}{\left( {\hat{I}}_{\text{or}} \right)}|_{\text{in}\ \text{dB}}\  - \ \left( \frac{\text{CPICH}_{}}{I_{\text{or}}} \right)|_{\text{in}\ \text{dB}} \leq \text{20}\text{dB}$

##### 9.1.2.1.2 Relative accuracy requirement

The relative accuracy of CPICH Ec/Io is defined as the maximum allowable
error in the measured difference between the CPICH Ec/Io measured from
one cell compared to the CPICH Ec/Io measured from another cell on the
same frequency.

The relative accuracy is defined using the lower CPICH\_Ec/Io of cell 1
and cell 2.

The accuracy requirements in table 9.6 are valid under the following
conditions:

CPICH\_RSCP1,2\|~dBm~ according to Annex B.3.5 for a corresponding Band

$\left| \text{CPICH}_{\text{RSCP}}1|_{\text{in}\ \text{dBm}} - \text{CPICH}_{\text{RSCP}}2|_{\text{in}\ \text{dBm}} \right| \leq \text{20}\text{dB}$

$\frac{I_{o}}{\left( {\hat{I}}_{\text{or}} \right)}|_{\text{in}\ \text{dB}}\  - \ \left( \frac{\text{CPICH}_{}}{I_{\text{or}}} \right)|_{\text{in}\ \text{dB}} \leq \text{20}\text{dB}$

##### 9.1.2.2.2 Relative accuracy requirement

The relative accuracy of CPICH Ec/Io in the inter frequency case is
defined as the maximum allowable error in the measured difference
between the CPICH Ec/Io measured from one cell compared to the CPICH
Ec/Io measured from another cell on a different frequency

The relative accuracy is defined using the lower CPICH\_Ec/Io of cell 1
and cell 2.

The accuracy requirements in table 9.8 are valid under the following
conditions:

CPICH\_RSCP1\|~dBm~ according to Annex B.3.7 for a corresponding Band

$\left| \text{CPICH}_{\text{RSCP}}1|_{\text{in}\ \text{dBm}} - \text{CPICH}_{\text{RSCP}}2|_{\text{in}\ \text{dBm}} \right| \leq \text{20}\text{dB}$

\| Channel 1\_Io\|~dBm/3,84\ MHz~ ‑Channel 2\_Io\|~dBm/3,84\ MHz~ \| ≤
20 dB.

$\frac{I_{o}}{\left( {\hat{I}}_{\text{or}} \right)}|_{\text{in}\ \text{dB}}\  - \ \left( \frac{\text{CPICH}_{}}{I_{\text{or}}} \right)|_{\text{in}\ \text{dB}} \leq \text{20}\text{dB}$

### 9.1.6 UE transmitted power

#### 9.1.6.1 Accuracy requirement

This requirement is applicable in CELL\_DCH state. The measured quantity
is the transmitted power averaged over the longest period (excluding a
25μs period either side of any expected composite power change) during
which the nominal composite symbol power reaches the maximum during 1
DPCH slot interval. The UE measured quantity absolute accuracy is
defined in Table 9.15.

Table 9.14: (void)

#### 9.1.6.2 UE transmitted power measurement report mapping

The reporting range for *UE transmitted power* is from -50 \...+33 dBm.

In table 9.15 the mapping of the measured quantity specified in Section
9.1.6.1 and the accuracy range are defined. The range in the signalling
may be larger than the guaranteed accuracy range. For each empty slot
created by compressed mode or discontinuous uplink DPCCH transmission,
no value shall be reported by the UE L1 for these slots.

### 9.1.7 SFN-CFN observed time difference

NOTE: This measurement is for handover timing purposes to identify
active cell and neighbour cell time difference.

#### 9.1.7.1 Intra frequency measurement requirement

The measurement period for CELL\_DCH state can be found in sub clause
8.1.2.2.

The accuracy requirement in table 9.16 is valid under the following
conditions:

CPICH\_RSCP1,2\|~dBm~ according to Annex B.3.8 for a corresponding Band

$\left| \text{CPICH}_{\text{RSCP}}1|_{\text{in}\ \text{dBm}} - \text{CPICH}_{\text{RSCP}}2|_{\text{in}\ \text{dBm}} \right| \leq \text{20}\text{dB}$

$\frac{I_{o}}{\left( {\hat{I}}_{\text{or}} \right)}|_{\text{in}\ \text{dB}}\  - \ \left( \frac{\text{CPICH}_{}}{I_{\text{or}}} \right)|_{\text{in}\ \text{dB}} \leq \text{20}\text{dB}$

$\frac{I_{o}}{\left( {\hat{I}}_{\text{or}} \right)}|_{\text{in}\ \text{dB}}\  - \ \left( \frac{P - \text{CCPCH}_{}}{I_{\text{or}}} \right)|_{\text{in}\ \text{dB}}$
is low enough to ensure successful SFN decoding.

#### 9.1.8.2 SFN-SFN observed time difference type 2

NOTE: This measurement is for location service purposes to identify time
difference between two cells.

It is optional for terminal to support the use of IPDL periods together
with SFN-SFN observed time difference type 2. The support of IPDL
depends on the supported UE positioning methods.

NOTE: Requirement on the UE shall be reconsidered when the state of the
art technology progress.

##### 9.1.8.2.1 Intra frequency measurement requirement accuracy without IPDL period active

The measurement period for CELL\_DCH state can be found in sub clause
8.1.2.2. The measurement period for CELL\_FACH state can be found in sub
clause 8.4.2.2.

The accuracy requirement in table 9.21 is valid under the following
conditions:

CPICH\_RSCP1,2\|~dBm~ according to Annex B.3.11 for a corresponding Band

$\frac{I_{o}}{\left( {\hat{I}}_{\text{or}} \right)}|_{\text{in}\ \text{dB}}\  - \ \left( \frac{\text{CPICH}_{}}{I_{\text{or}}} \right)|_{\text{in}\ \text{dB}} \leq \text{20}\text{dB}$

##### 9.1.8.2.2 Intra frequency measurement requirement accuracy with IPDL period active

This requirement is valid only for UEs supporting IPDL measurements.

The measurement period for CELL\_DCH state can be found in sub clause
8.1.2.2. The measurement period for CELL\_FACH state can be found in sub
clause 8.4.2.2.

The accuracy requirement in table 9.22 is valid under the following
conditions:

CPICH\_RSCP1,2\|~dBm~ according to Annex B.3.11 for a corresponding Band

$\frac{I_{o}}{\left( {\hat{I}}_{\text{or}} \right)}|_{\text{in}\ \text{dB}}\  - \ \left( \frac{\text{CPICH}_{}}{I_{\text{or}}} \right)|_{\text{in}\ \text{dB}} \leq \text{20}\text{dB}$

Additionally the accuracy requirement in table 9.22 is also valid for
neighbour cells for which the following conditions apply to during idle
periods provided idle periods have a length of 1 slot:

CPICH\_RSCPx,y\|~dBm~ ≥ -114 dBm.

$\frac{I_{o_{\text{idle}_{\text{period}}}}}{\left( {\hat{I}}_{\text{or}} \right)}|_{\text{in}\ \text{dB}}\  - \ \left( \frac{\text{CPICH}_{}}{I_{\text{or}}} \right)|_{\text{in}\ \text{dB}} \leq \text{20}\text{dB}$,

where *x* and *y* represent cells measured using idle periods and
I~o\_idle-period~ is the total received power during the idle period.

NOTE: Additional general conditions are needed for the requirements in
table 9.22 to be valid.

### 9.1.13 UE transmission power headroom

#### 9.1.13.1 Delay requirement

The UE transmission power headroom measurement reporting delay is
defined as the time between the end of the UE transmission power
headroom measurement period and the time when the UE starts transmitting
the measurement report over the Uu interface. The reporting delay of the
UE transmission power headroom measurement result shall be not more than
10 ms, which is applicable for all configured triggering mechanisms for
UE transmission power headroom measurement.

#### 9.1.13.2 Measurement period requirement

The reported UE transmission power headroom measurement result shall be
an estimate of the average value of the UE transmission power headroom
over a 100 ms period. The UE transmission power headroom measurement
shall exclude the empty slots created by the compressed mode or
discontinuous uplink DPCCH transmission.

If the UE is in CELL\_FACH state, the UE can be configured to send DPCCH
for a configurable number of radio frames prior to the start of the
E-DCH transmissions. The UE in CELL\_FACH state reports the headroom
available based on the average of the DPCCH power including the period
DPCCH is transmitted prior to the start of the E-DCH transmissions. The
averaging period for the UE transmission power headroom measurement in
CELL\_FACH state, after the commencement of the data transmission, is
10ms.

For the first measurement, if less than 20 ms of DPCCH is configured
prior to the start of the E-DCH transmissions, the UE in CELL\_FACH
state reports the headroom available based on the last successfully
transmitted PRACH preamble power. In this case, the UPH can be computed
from P~preamble~ using the P~p-e~:

UPH = P~max,tx~ -- P~preamble~ -- P~p-e~

where P~max,tx~ is the UE maximum transmission power, P~preamble~ is the
transmitted code power on PRACH preamble, and P~p-e~ is the power offset
between the power of the last transmitted preamble and the initial DPCCH
transmission power, all in dB.

The UE *transmission* power headroom reporting range is from 0 \...+31
dB. Table 9.34A defines the mapping

NOTE: This measurement is used for UE positioning purposes.

The measurement period shall be \[1\] second.

#### 9.2.10.1 Accuracy requirement

Three accuracy classes are defined for the UTRAN GPS Timing of Cell
Frames for UE positioning measurement, i.e. accuracy class A, B and C.
The implemented accuracy class depends on the UE positioning methods
that are supported.

######## Annex A (normative): Test Cases

A.1 Purpose of Annex
====================

This Annex specifies test specific parameters for some of the functional
requirements in chapters 4 to 9. The tests provide additional
information to how the requirements should be interpreted for the
purpose of conformance testing. The tests in this Annex are described
such that one functional requirement may be tested in one or several
test and one test may verify several requirements. Some requirements may
lack a test.

The conformance tests are specified in TS34.121. Statistical
interpretation of the requirements is described in Annex A.2.

A.2 Requirement classification for statistical testing
======================================================

Editors note: Each requirement in the annex have to be gone through and
updated with which type it belongs to and in applicable cases, which
success rate that defines the requirement. Tdoc R4 00 619 shall be used
as a base for that work.

Requirements in this specification are either expressed as absolute
requirements with a single value stating the requirement, or expressed
as a success rate. There are no provisions for the statistical
variations that will occur when the parameter is tested.

Annex A outlines the test in more detail and lists the test parameters
needed. The test will result in an outcome of a test variable value for
the DUT inside or outside the test limit. Overall, the probability of a
\"good\" DUT being inside the test limit(s) and the probability of a
\"bad\" DUT being outside the test limit(s) should be as high as
possible. For this reason, when selecting the test variable and the test
limit(s), the statistical nature of the test is accounted for.

The statistical nature depends on the type of requirement. Some have
large statistical variations, while others are not statistical in nature
at all. When testing a parameter with a statistical nature, a confidence
level is set. This establishes the probability that a DUT passing the
test actually meets the requirement and determines how many times a test
has to be repeated and what the pass and fail criteria are. Those
aspects are not covered by TS 25.133. The details of the tests, how many
times to run it and how to establish confidence in the tests are
described in TS 34.121. This Annex establishes what the test variable is
and whether it can be viewed as statistical in nature or not.

A.2.1 Types of requirements in TS 25.133
----------------------------------------

**Time and delay requirements on UE higher layer actions**

A very large part of the RRM requirements are delay requirements:

\- In idle mode (A.4) there is cell re-selection delay.

\- In UTRAN Connected Mode Mobility (A.5) there is measurement reporting
delay, handover delay and cell re-selection delay.

\- In RRC Connection Control (A.6) there is RRC re-establishment delay
and TFC blocking delay.

All have in common that the UE is required to perform an action
observable in higher layers (e.g. camp on the correct cell) within a
certain time after a specific event (e.g. a new strong pilot arises).
The delay time is statistical in nature for several reasons, among
others that measurements required by the UE are performed in a fading
radio environment.

The variations make a strict limit unsuitable for a test. Instead there
is a condition set for a correct action by the UE, e.g. that the UE
shall camp on the correct cell within X seconds. Then the rate of
correct events is observed during repeated tests and a limit is set on
the rate of correct events, usually 90% correct events are required. How
the limit is applied in the test depends on the confidence required,
further detailed are in TS 34.121.

**Measurements of power levels, relative powers and time**

A very large number of requirements are on measurements that the UE
performs:

\- In UTRAN Connected Mode Mobility (A.5) there are measurement reports.

\- Measurement performance requirements (A.8) has requirements on all
type of measurements.

The accuracy requirements on measurements are expressed in this
specification as a fixed limit (e.g. +/-X dB), but the measurement error
will have a distribution that is not easily confined in fixed limits.
Assuming a Gaussian distribution of the error, the limits will have to
be set at +/-3.29σ if the probability of failing a \"good DUT\" in a
single test is to be kept at 0.1%. It is more reasonable to set the
limit tighter and test the DUT by counting the rate of measurements that
are within he limits, in a way similar to the requirements on delay.

**Implementation requirements**

A few requirements are strict actions the UE should take or capabilities
the UE should have, without any allowance for deviations. These
requirements are absolute and should be tested as such. Examples are

\- \"Event triggered report rate\" and \"Active set dimension\" in UTRAN
Connected Mode Mobility (A.5)

\- \"Correct behaviour at time-out\" in RRC connection control (A.6)

**Physical layer timing requirements**

All requirements on \"Timing Characteristics\" (A.7) are absolute limits
on timing accuracy.

**BER and BLER requirements**

Some measurement report procedures in \"UE Measurement procedures\"
(A.8) have requirements on DCH BLER. These are tested in the same way as
BLER requirements in TS 25.101.

A.3 RRM test configurations
===========================

A.3.1 UE with single antenna connector
--------------------------------------

For testing a UE with a single UTRA antenna connector, the test
configuration is fully described in sections A.4 to A.9

A.3.2 UE with multiple antenna connectors
-----------------------------------------

For testing a UE with multiple UTRA receive diversity antenna
connectors, test signals from each cell in section A.4 to A.9 shall be
generated with independent fading (fading applicable to test cases
A.8.1.4, A.8.1.5, A.8.1.6, A.8.2.2 and A.8.2.3 only) and applied to each
antenna port. For each carrier frequency specified in the testcase,
independent noise shall be generated and applied to each antenna port.

The received power spectral density at each antenna connector n, denoted
as Îor,~n~ shall be the same as to the received power spectal density
Îor specified for testing a UE with a single antenna connector. The
noise spectral density at each antenna connector n, denoted as Ioc, ~n~
shall be the same as the noise spectral density Ioc specified for
testing a UE with a single antenna connector.

A.4 Idle Mode
=============

A.4.1 (void)
------------

A.4.2 Cell Re-Selection
-----------------------

Five scenarios are considered:

\- Scenario 1: Single carrier case

\- Scenario 2: Multi carrier case

\- Scenario 3: Idle mode interfrequency reselection with an increased
number of carriers

\- Scenario 4: Idle mode intrafrequency reselection with extended DRX
cycle

\- Scenario 5: Idle mode interfrequency reselection with extended DRX
cycle

For each of them a test is proposed.

NOTE: Existing scenarios cover only requirements in section 4.2.2.2 and
4.2.2.3. More scenarios, covering requirements in section 4.2.2.1, will
be added later.

### A.4.2.1 Scenario 1: Single carrier case

#### A.4.2.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment

This test is to verify the requirement for the cell re-selection delay
in the single carrier case reported in section 4.2.2.

This scenario implies the presence of 1 carrier and 6 cells as given in
tables A.4.1 and A.4.2. The UE is requested to monitor neighbouring
cells on 1 carrier. The maximum repetition period of the relevant system
info blocks that needs to be received by the UE to camp on a cell shall
be 1280 ms. Cell 1 and cell 2 shall belong to different Location Areas.

#### A.4.2.1.2 Test Requirements

The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 1, and starts to
send preambles on the PRACH for sending the RRC CONNECTION REQUEST
message to perform a Location Registration on cell 1.

The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 8 s.

The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%.

NOTE: The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as: T~evaluateFDD~ +
T~SI~,

where:

T~evaluateFDD~ See Table 4.1 in section 4.2.2.

T~SI~ Maximum repetition period of relevant system info blocks that
needs to be received by the UE to camp on a cell. 1280 ms is assumed in
this test case.

This gives a total of 7.68 s, allow 8s in the test case.

### A.4.2.2 Scenario 2: Multi carrier case

#### A.4.2.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment

This test is to verify the requirement for the cell re-selection delay
in the multi carrier case reported in section 4.2.2.

This scenario implies the presence of 2 carriers and 6 cells as given in
tables A.4.3 and A.4.4. The UE is requested to monitor neighbouring
cells on 2 carriers. The maximum repetition period of the relevant
system info blocks that needs to be received by the UE to camp on a cell
shall be 1280 ms. Cell 1 and cell 2 shall belong to different Location
Areas.

#### A.4.2.2.2 Test Requirements

The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 1, and starts to
send preambles on the PRACH for sending the RRC CONNECTION REQUEST
message to perform a Location Registration on cell 1.

The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 8 s.

The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%.

NOTE: The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as: T~evaluateFDD~ +
T~SI~,

where:

T~evaluateFDD~ See Table 4.1 in section 4.2.2.

T~SI~ Maximum repetition period of relevant system info blocks that
needs to be received by the UE to camp on a cell. 1280 ms is assumed in
this test case.

This gives a total of 7.68 s, allow 8s in the test case.

### A.4.2.3 Idle mode interfrequency reselection with an increased number of carriers

#### A.4.2.3.1 Test Purpose and Environment

This test is to verify the requirement for the cell re-selection delay
for the increased UE carrier monitoring case reported in section 4.2.2.

This scenario implies the presence of 4 carriers and 4 cells as given in
tables A.4.4A, A.4.4B and A.4.4C. The UE is requested to monitor
neighbouring cells on 5 carriers. The maximum repetition period of the
relevant system info blocks that needs to be received by the UE to camp
on a cell shall be 1280 ms. Cell 1 and cell 2, 3 and 4 shall all belong
to different Location Areas. Cells 2, 3 and 4 are chosen randomly, such
that one frequency belongs to the normal performance group and two
frequencies belong to the reduced performance group. The neighbour lists
of cells 2, 3 and 4 shall include the frequency of cell 1 in the normal
performance group as well as the other frequencies configured to the UE
in the test. Cells 1,2,3 and 4 all have equal absolute priority.

#### A.4.2.3.2 Test Requirements

The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
the relevant time period, to the moment when the UE camps on the target
cell, and starts to send preambles on the PRACH for sending the RRC
CONNECTION REQUEST message to perform a Location Registration on the
target cell.

Table A.4.4D

  ------------ ------------------------------------ ---------------------------------------------
  Time phase   Target cell                          Requirement for reselection delay (seconds)
  T1           Cell 2 (normal performance group)    14.1
  T2           Cell 3 (reduced performance group)   116.5
  T3           Cell 4 (reduced performance group)   116.5
  T4           Cell 1 (normal performance group)    14.1
  ------------ ------------------------------------ ---------------------------------------------

The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%, with a successful reselection counted if it is
within the required time regardless of the carrier frequencies involved.
At least 90% of reselections to the reduced performance group shall be
within the required time, with a successful reselection counted if it is
within the required time regardless of the carrier frequencies involved.

NOTE: The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as:

N~norm,\ inter~ \* T~evaluateFDD~ + T~SI~ (normal performance group) and
N~reduced,\ inter~ \* 6 \* T~evaluateFDD~ + T~SI~ (reduced performance
group)

where:

T~evaluateFDD~ See Table 4.1 in section 4.2.2.

T~SI~ Maximum repetition period of relevant system info blocks that
needs to be received by the UE to camp on a cell. 1280 ms is assumed in
this test case.

This gives a total of

14.08 s when N~norm,\ inter~=2 for reselections to normal performance
group, allow 14.1s in the test case.

116.48 s when N~norm,\ reducced~=3 for reselections to reduced
performance group, allow 116.5s in the test case.

### A.4.2.4 Scenario 4: Single carrier case with extended DRX

#### A.4.2.4.1 Test Purpose and Environment

This test is to verify the requirement for the cell re-selection delay
in the single carrier case reported in section 4.2.2.

This scenario implies the presence of 1 carrier and 6 cells as given in
tables A.4.1 and A.4.2. The UE is requested to monitor neighbouring
cells on 1 carrier. The maximum repetition period of the relevant system
info blocks that needs to be received by the UE to camp on a cell shall
be 1280 ms. Cell 1 and cell 2 shall belong to different Location Areas.

#### A.4.2.1.2 Test Requirements

The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 1, and starts to
send preambles on the PRACH for sending the RRC CONNECTION REQUEST
message to perform a Location Registration on cell 1.

The cell re-selection delay shall be less than \[40.96s+4s+1.28s\].

The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%.

NOTE: The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as: eDRX cycle + PTW
+ T~SI~,

where:

PTW Paging Time Window defined in Table A.4.4E above

T~SI~ Maximum repetition period of relevant system info blocks that
needs to be received by the UE to camp on a cell. 1280 ms is assumed in
this test case.

This gives a total of 46.24 s, allow 47 s in the test case.

### A.4.2.4 Scenario 5: Idle mode interfrequency reselection with extended DRX

This test is to verify the requirement for the cell re-selection delay
for the extended DRX carrier monitoring case reported in section 4.2.2.

This scenario implies the presence of 2 carriers and 6 cells as given in
tables A.4.4G and A.4.4H. The UE is requested to monitor neighbouring
cells on 2 carriers. The maximum repetition period of the relevant
system info blocks that needs to be received by the UE to camp on a cell
shall be 1280 ms. Cell 1 and cell 2 shall belong to different Location
Areas.

#### A.4.2.2.2 Test Requirements

The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 1, and starts to
send preambles on the PRACH for sending the RRC CONNECTION REQUEST
message to perform a Location Registration on cell 1.

The cell re-selection delay shall be less than \[40.96s+4s+1.28s\].

The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%.

NOTE: The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as: eDRX cycle + PTW
+ T~SI~,

where:

PTW Paging Time Window defined in Table A.4.4G above

T~SI~ Maximum repetition period of relevant system info blocks that
needs to be received by the UE to camp on a cell. 1280 ms is assumed in
this test case.

This gives a total of 46.24 s, allow 47 s in the test case.

#### A.4.3.1.2 Test Requirements

The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 2, and starts to
send the RR Channel Request message for location update to Cell 2.

The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 26 s + T~BCCH,~ where
T~BCCH~ is the maximum time allowed to read BCCH data from GSM cell
\[21\].

The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%.

NOTE: The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as: 4\* T~measureGSM~
+ T~BCCH~, where:

T~measureGSM~ See Table 4.1 in section 4.2.2.

T~BCCH~ Maximum time allowed to read BCCH data from GSM cell \[21\].\
According to \[21\], the maximum time allowed to read the BCCH data,
when being synchronized to a BCCH carrier, is 1.9 s.

This gives a total of 25.6 s + T~BCCH~, allow 26 s + T~BCCH~ in the test
case.

#### A.4.3.2.2 Test Requirements

The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 2, and starts to
send the RR Channel Request message for location update to Cell 2.

The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 7.7 s + T~BCCH,~ where
T~BCCH~ is the maximum time allowed to read BCCH data from GSM cell
\[21\].

The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%.

NOTE: The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as: Max(3\*
T~measureFDD~, T~measureGSM~+DRX cycle length) + T~BCCH~, where:

T~measureFDD~ See Table 4.1 in section 4.2.2.

T~measureGSM~ See Table 4.1 in section 4.2.2.

DRX cycle length 1.28s see Table A.4.7.A

T~BCCH~ Maximum time allowed to read BCCH data from GSM cell \[21\].\
According to \[21\], the maximum time allowed to read the BCCH data,
when being synchronized to a BCCH carrier, is 1.9 s.

This gives a total of 7.68 s + T~BCCH~, allow 7.7 s + T~BCCH~ in the
test case.

### A.4.3.3 Scenario 3

#### A.4.4.1.2 1.28 Mcps TDD Option

This test is to verify the requirement for the FDD/TDD cell re-selection
delay reported in section 4.2.2.

This scenario implies the presence of UTRA FDD and 1 UTRA TDD cell as
given in Table A.4.11, A.4.12 and A4.13. The maximum repetition period
of the relevant system information blocks that need to be received by
the UE to camp on a cell shall be 1280 ms.

Cell 1 and cell 2 shall belong to different Location Areas.

### A.4.4.2 Test Requirements

The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 2, and starts to
send the RRC CONNECTION REQUEST message to perform a Location
Registration on cell 2.

The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 8 s.

The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%.

NOTE: The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as:

T~evaluateTDD~ + T~SI~

where:

T~evaluateTDD~ See Table 4.1 in section 4.2.2.

T~SI~ Maximum repetition period of relevant system info blocks that
needs to be received by the UE to camp on a cell. 1280 ms is assumed in
this test case.

This gives a total of 7.68 s, allow 8s in the test case.

A.4.5 UTRAN to E-UTRA Cell Reselection
--------------------------------------

### A.4.5.1 E-UTRA FDD is of higher priority

#### A.4.5.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment

This test is to verify the requirement for the UTRA FDD to E-UTRA FDD
inter-RAT cell reselection delay reported in section 4.2.

The test scenario comprises two different cells, with cell 1 being the
UTRA serving cell and cell 2 being the E-UTRA cell to be re-selected to.
Test parameters are given in Tables A.4.14, A.4.15, A.4.16. The test
consists of three successive time periods, with time duration of T1, T2,
and T3, respectively. UTRA cell 1 is already identified by the UE prior
to the start of the test. Cell 2 is of higher priority than cell 1.

Cell 1 and cell 2 shall belong to different tracking areas. Furthermore,
UE has not registered with network for the tracking area containing cell
2.

#### A.4.5.1.2 Test Requirements

The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 2, and starts to
send preambles on the PRACH for sending the RRC CONNECTION REQUEST
message to perform a Tracking Area Update procedure on Cell 2.

The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 81 s.

The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%.

NOTE: The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as:
T~higher\_priority\_search~ + T~evaluateEUTRA~ + T~SI~, where:

T~higher\_priority\_search~ See section 4.2.2

T~evaluateEUTRA~ See Table 4.2 in section 4.2.2.5a

T~SI~ Maximum repetition period of relevant system info blocks that
needs to be received by the UE to camp on a cell; 1280 ms is assumed in
this test case.

This gives a total of 80.48 s, allow 81 s in the test case.

### A.4.5.2 E-UTRA FDD is of lower priority

#### A.4.5.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment

This test is to verify the requirement for the UTRAN to E-UTRAN cell
reselection delay reported in section 4.2.

This scenario implies the presence of 1 UTRAN serving cell, and 1
E-UTRAN cell to be re-selected. The UE is requested to monitor
neighbouring cells on 1 UTRAN carrier and 1 E-UTRAN carrier. Test
parameters are given in Table, A.4.17, A.4.18, A.4.19. The test consists
of two successive time periods, with time duration of T1 and T2,
respectively. Both UTRA cell 1 and E-UTRA cell 2 are already identified
by the UE prior to the start of the test. Cell 2 is of lower priority
than cell 1. Cell 1 and cell 2 shall belong to different tracking areas.

#### A.4.5.2.2 Test Requirements

The cell reselection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 2, and starts to
send preambles on the PRACH for sending the RRC CONNECTION REQUEST
message to perform a Tracking Area Update procedure on Cell 2.

The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 21 s.

The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%.

NOTE: The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as: T~evaluateEUTRA~
+ T~SI-EUTRA~, where:

T~evaluateEUTRA~ See Table 4.2 in section 4.2.2.

T~SI-EUTRA~ Maximum time allowed to read system information from a
E-UTRA cell \[24\].\
According to \[24\], the maximum time allowed to read relevant system
info blocks, that need to be received by the UE to camp on a cell, is
1280 ms.

This gives a total of 20.48 s, allow 21 s in the test case.

### A.4.5.3 RSRQ based reselection when E-UTRA FDD is of higher priority

#### A.4.5.3.1 Test Purpose and Environment

This test is to verify the requirement for the UTRA FDD to E-UTRA FDD
inter-RAT cell reselection delay reported based on RSRQ measurement in
section 4.2.

The test scenario comprises two different cells, with cell 1 being the
UTRA serving cell, cell 2 being the E-UTRA cell to be re-selected to.
Test parameters are given in Tables A.4.20, A.4.21, A.4.22. The test
consists of four successive time periods, with time duration of T1, T2,
T3 and T4, respectively. UTRA cell 1 is already identified by the UE
prior to the start of the test. Cell 2 is of higher priority than cell
1.

Cell 1 and cell 2 shall belong to different tracking areas. Furthermore,
UE has not registered with network for the tracking area containing cell
2.

#### A.4.5.3.2 Test Requirements

The UE shall not send preambles on the PRACH before the end of T2.

The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
time period T3, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 2, and starts to
send preambles on the PRACH for sending the RRC CONNECTION REQUEST
message to perform a Tracking Area Update procedure on Cell 2. The cell
re-selection delay shall be less than 21 s.

The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%.

NOTE: The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as:
T~higher\_priority\_search~ + T~evaluateEUTRA~ + T~SI~, where:

T~higher\_priority\_search~ See section 4.2.2, where, this value should
be 0s, since the cell2 shall be already indentified at the beginning of
T3

T~evaluateEUTRA~ See Table 4.2 in section 4.2.2.5a

T~SI~ Maximum repetition period of relevant system info blocks that
needs to be received by the UE to camp on a cell; 1280 ms is assumed in
this test case.

This gives a total of 20.48 s, allow 21 s in the test case.

### A.4.5.4 E-UTRA FDD is of higher priority (Increased UE carrier monitoring)

#### A.4.5.4.1 Test Purpose and Environment

This test is to verify the requirement for the UTRA FDD to E-UTRA FDD
inter-RAT cell reselection delay for the increased UE carrier monitoring
case reported in section 4.2.

The test scenario comprises four different cells, with cell 1 being the
UTRA serving cell and cell 2, cell 3 and cell 4 being the E-UTRA FDD
cells to be re-selected to. The UE is requested to monitor E-UTRA FDD
neighbouring cells on 8 carriers. Test parameters are given in Tables
A.4.23, A.4.24, A.4.25, A.4.26, A.4.27. The test consists of seven
successive time periods, with time duration of T0, T1, T2, T3, T4, T5
and T6 respectively respectively. All cells are identified by the UE
during T0. Cell 2, cell 3 and cell 4 are of higher priority than cell 1.
Cells 2, 3 and 4 are chosen randomly, such that one frequency belongs to
the E-UTRA FDD normal performance group and two frequencies belong to
the E-UTRA FDD reduced performance group. The neighbour lists of cells
2, 3 and 4 shall include the frequency of cell 1 (in the UTRA FDD normal
performance group) as well as the other frequencies configured to the UE
in the test.

Cell 1 and cells 2, 3 and 4 shall all belong to different location
areas. Furthermore, UE has not registered with network for the location
area containing cells 2, 3 and 4.

#### A.4.5.4.2 Test Requirements

The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
the relevant time period, to the moment when the UE camps on the target
cell, and starts to send preambles on the PRACH for sending the RRC
CONNECTION REQUEST message to perform a Location Registration on the
target cell.

  ------------ ----------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------
  Time phase   Target cell                                     Requirement for reselection delay (seconds)
  T0           Cell 1                                          
  T1           Cell 2 (E-UTRA FDD normal performance group)    78.1
  T2           Cell 1                                          21
  T3           Cell 3 (E-UTRA FDD reduced performance group)   462.1
  T4           Cell 1                                          21
  T5           Cell 4 (E-UTRA FDD reduced performance group)   462.1
  ------------ ----------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------

The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%, with a successful reselection counted if it is
within the required time regardless of the carrier frequencies involved.
At least 90% of reselections to the reduced performance group shall be
within the required time and at least 90% of reselections to the normal
performance group shall be within the required time, with a successful
reselection counted if it is within the required time regardless of the
carrier frequencies involved.

NOTE: The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as:

K~norm,\ EUTRA~ \* T~evaluateEUTRA~ + T~SI~, for E-UTRA FDD normal
performance group = 4\*19.2 + 1.28 = 76.8 + 1.28 = 78.08s

K~reduced,\ EUTRA~ \* 6 \* T~evaluateEUTRA~ + T~SI~, for E-UTRA FDD
reduced performance group = 4\*6\*19.2 + 1.28 = 460.8 + 1.28 = 462.08s

where:

K~norm,\ EUTRA~ See section 4.2.2

K~reduced,\ EUTRA~ See section 4.2.2

T~higher\_priority\_search~ See section 4.2.2

T~evaluateEUTRA~ See Table 4.2 in section 4.2.2.5a

T~SI~ Maximum repetition period of relevant system info blocks that
needs to be received by the UE to camp on a cell; 1280 ms is assumed in
this test case.

This gives a total of:

78.08 s when K~norm,\ EUTRA~=4 for reselections to E-UTRA FDD normal
performance group, allow 78.1s in the test case.

462.08 s when K~reduced,\ EUTRA~=4 for reselections to E-UTRA FDD
reduced performance group, allow 462.1s in the test case.

A.4.5A UTRAN to E-UTRA TDD Cell Reselection with Increased Carrier Monitoring
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

### A.4.5A.1 Test Purpose and Environment

This test is to verify the requirement for the UTRA FDD to E-UTRA TDD
inter-RAT cell reselection delay for increased carrier monitoring case
reported in section 4.2. 3 **cells on 3 different carriers are
configured on test equipment with Cell 1 being the serving cell and
Cells 2 and 3 being the neighbour EUTRA cells** such that Cell 2 belongs
to the normal performance group and Cell 3 belongs to the reduced
performance group**.** The UE is requested to monitor neighbouring cells
on 8 carriers. **E-UTRA cells are of higher priority than UTRA.**

The test scenario comprises three different cells, with cell 1 being the
UTRA serving cell and cell 2 and 3 being the E-UTRA cells to be
re-selected to. Test parameters are given in Tables A.4.14A, A.4.15A,
A.4.16A, A.4.17A,. The test consists of five successive time periods,
with time durations T0, T1, T2, T3 and T4, respectively.

Cell 1, Cell 2, Cell 3 shall belong to different tracking areas.
Furthermore, UE has not registered with network for the tracking area
containing Cell 2 and Cell 3.

#### A.4.5A.2 Test Requirements

The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
a relevant time period, to the moment when the UE camps on the target
cell, and starts to send preambles on the PRACH for sending the RRC
CONNECTION REQUEST message to perform a Tracking Area Update procedure
on the target Cell.

  ------------ ------------------------------------ ---------------------------------------------

The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90% with a successful reselection counted if it is
within the required time regardless of the carrier frequencies involved.
At least 90% of reselections to the reduced performance group shall be
within the required time, and at least 90% of reselections to the normal
performance group shall be within the required time, with a successful
reselection counted if it is within the required time regardless of the
carrier frequencies involved.

NOTE: The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as: K~norm,\ EUTRA~
\* T~evaluateEUTRA~ + T~SI~ for normal performance group and
K~reduced,\ EUTRA~ \* T~evaluateE-UTRA~ + T~SI~ for reduced performance
group where:

> T~evaluateEUTRA~ See Table 4.2 in section 4.2.2.5a
>
> K~norm,\ EUTRA~ Number of E-UTRA carriers in the normal performance
> group
>
> K~reduced,\ EUTRA~ Number of E-UTRA carriers in the reduced
> performance group
>
> T~SI~ Maximum repetition period of relevant system info blocks that
> needs to be received by the UE to camp on a cell; 1280 ms is assumed
> in this test case.

This gives a total of

78.08s when K~norm,\ EUTRA~ =4 for reselections to normal performance
group, allow 78.1s in the test case.

462.08s when K~reduced,\ EUTRA~ =4 for reselections to reduced
performance group, allow 462.1s in the test case.

A.5.1 FDD/FDD Soft Handover
---------------------------

### A.5.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify the requirement for the soft
handover delay in CELL\_DCH state specified in section 5.1.2.

The test parameters are given in Table A.5A and A.5B below. In the
measurement control information it is indicated to the UE that
event-triggered reporting with Event 1A shall be used, and that CPICH
Ec/Io and SFN-CFN observed time difference shall be reported together
with Event 1A. The test consists of six successive time periods, with a
time duration of T1, T2, T3, T4, T5 and T6 respectively. At the start of
time duration T1, the UE may not have any timing information of cell 2.

#### A.5.1.1.1 Test procedure

1\) The test is started at the beginning of T1.

2\) During time period T2 an Event 1A triggered measurement report shall
be sent by the UE containing the CFN-SFN observed time difference
between cell 1 and cell 2.

3\) At the beginning of T3 the downlink DPCH of cell 2 shall be
activated.

4\) UTRAN shall send a Active Set Update command with activation time
now adding cell 2 to the active set. The Active Set Update message shall
be sent to the UE so that the whole message is available at the UE at
the beginning of T4.

5\) At the beginning of T5 the DPCH from cell 1 shall be switched off.

### A.5.1.2 Test Requirements

The measured quality on the DTCH of the UE downlink during T6 shall be
BLER=0.01±30%.

A.5.2 FDD/FDD Hard Handover
---------------------------

### A.5.2.1 Handover to intra-frequency cell

#### A.5.2.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify the requirement for the hard
handover delay in CELL\_DCH state in the single carrier case reported in
section 5.2.2.1.

The test parameters are given in Table A.5.0 and A.5.0A below. In the
measurement control information it is indicated to the UE that
event-triggered reporting with Event 1A and 1B shall be used, and that
CPICH Ec/Io and SFN-CFN observed timed difference shall be reported
together with Event 1A. The test consists of three successive time
periods, with a time duration of T1, T2 and T3 respectively. At the
start of time duration T1, the UE may not have any timing information of
cell 2.

UTRAN shall send a Physical Channel reconfiguration with activation time
\"now\" with a new active cell, cell 2. The Physical Channel
reconfiguration message shall be sent to the UE during period T2, after
the UE has reported event 1A. T3 is defined as the end of the last TTI
containing the physical channel reconfiguration message.

#### A.5.2.1.2 Test Requirements

The UE shall start to transmit the UL DPCCH to Cell 2 less than 190 ms
from the beginning of time period T3.

The rate of correct handovers observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

### A.5.2.2 Handover to inter-frequency cell 

#### A.5.2.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify the requirement for the inter
frequency hard handover delay in CELL\_DCH state as specified in section
5.2.2.1.

The test consists of three successive time periods, with a time duration
T1, T2 and T3. The test parameters are given in tables A.5.0B and A.5.0C
below. In the measurement control information it is indicated to the UE
that event-triggered reporting with Event 2C shall be used. The CPICH
Ec/I0 of the best cell on the unused frequency shall be reported
together with Event 2C reporting. At the start of time duration T1, the
UE may not have any timing information of cell 2.

UTRAN shall send a Physical Channel reconfiguration with activation time
\"now\" with one active cell, cell 2. The Physical Channel
reconfiguration message shall be sent to the UE during period T2, after
the UE has reported event 2C T3 is defined as the end of the last TTI
containing the physical channel reconfiguration message.

#### A.5.2.2.2 Test Requirements

The UE shall start to transmit the UL DPCCH to Cell 2 less than 220 ms
from the beginning of time period T3.

The rate of correct handovers observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

A.5.4 Inter-system Handover from UTRAN FDD to GSM
-------------------------------------------------

#### A.5.4.1 Test Purpose and Environment

This test is to verify the requirement for the UTRAN to GSM cell
handover delay reported in section 5.4.2.1.

The test parameters are given in Table A.5.0D, A.5.0E and A.5.0F below.
In the measurement control information it is indicated to the UE that
event-triggered reporting with Event 3C shall be used.. The test
consists of three successive time periods, with a time duration of T1,
T2 and T3 respectively. At the start of time duration T1, the UE may not
have any timing information of cell 2.

The UTRAN shall send a Handover from UTRAN command with activation time
\"now\" with a new active cell, cell 2. In the GSM Handover command
contained in that message, the IE starting time shall not be included.
The RRC HANDOVER FROM UTRAN COMMAND message shall be sent to the UE. The
start of T3 is defined as the end of last TTI containing the HO command.

The requirements are also applicable for a UE not requiring compressed
mode, in which case no compressed mode pattern should be sent for the
parameters specified in table A5.0D

#### A.5.4.2 Test Requirements

The UE shall begin to send access bursts on the new DCCH of the target
cell less than 100 ms from the beginning of time period T3.

The rate of correct handovers observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

NOTE: The test requirement in this test case is expressed as:

T~Handover\ delay~ = 90 ms (Table 5.2) + T~offset~ + T~UL~

T~offset~ : Equal to 4.65 ms, GSM timing uncertainty between the time
from when the UE is ready to transmit until the start of the next
timeslot in GSM 26 multiframe structure

T~UL~: Equal to 4.65 ms, the time the UE has to wait in case the next
timeslot is an idle frame or a SACCH frame.

This gives a total of 99.3 ms, allow 100 ms in the test case.

#### A.5.4a Inter-system Handover from UTRAN FDD to E-UTRAN FDD

#### A.5.4a.1 Test Purpose and Environment

This test is to verify the requirement for the UTRAN FDD to E-UTRAN FDD
handover requirements specified in section 5.4a.

The test parameters are given in Table A.5.0G, A.5.0H and A.5.0I below.
In the measurement control information it is indicated to the UE that
event-triggered reporting with Event 3A shall be used. The test consists
of three successive time periods, with time durations of T1, T2 and T3
respectively. At the start of time duration T1, the UE does not have any
timing information of Cell 2. Starting T2, Cell 2 becomes detectable and
the UE is expected to detect and send a measurement report.

The UTRAN shall send a Handover from UTRAN command with activation time
\"now\" with a new active cell, cell 2. In the E-UTRAN Handover command
contained in that message, the IE starting time shall not be included.
The RRC HANDOVER FROM UTRAN COMMAND message shall be sent to the UE. The
start of T3 is defined as the end of last TTI containing the HO command.

The requirements are also applicable for a UE not requiring compressed
mode, in which case no compressed mode pattern should be sent for the
parameters specified in table A.5.0G.

### A.5.4a.2 Test Requirements

The UE shall start to transmit the PRACH to Cell 2 less than 85 ms from
the beginning of time period T3.

The rate of correct handovers observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

#### A.5.4b Inter-system Handover from UTRAN FDD to E-UTRAN TDD

#### A.5.4b.1 Test Purpose and Environment

This test is to verify the requirement for the UTRAN FDD to E-UTRAN TDD
handover requirements specified in section 5.4b.

The test parameters are given in Table A.5.0J, A.5.0K and A.5.0L below.
In the measurement control information it is indicated to the UE that
event-triggered reporting with Event 3A shall be used. The test consists
of three successive time periods, with time durations of T1, T2 and T3
respectively. At the start of time duration T1, the UE does not have any
timing information of Cell 2. Starting T2, Cell 2 becomes detectable and
the UE is expected to detect and send a measurement report.

The UTRAN shall send a Handover from UTRAN command with activation time
\"now\" with a new active cell, cell 2. In the E-UTRAN Handover command
contained in that message, the IE starting time shall not be included.
The RRC HANDOVER FROM UTRAN COMMAND message shall be sent to the UE. The
start of T3 is defined as the end of last TTI containing the HO command.

The requirements are also applicable for a UE not requiring compressed
mode, in which case no compressed mode pattern should be sent for the
parameters specified in table A.5.0J.

### A.5.4b.2 Test Requirements

The UE shall start to transmit the PRACH to Cell 2 less than 80 ms from
the beginning of time period T3.

The rate of correct handovers observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

A.5.4c Inter-system Handover from UTRAN FDD to E-UTRAN FDD; Unknown Target Cell
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### A.5.4c.1 Test Purpose and Environment

This test is to verify the requirement for the UTRAN FDD to E-UTRAN FDD
handover requirements for the case when the target E-UTRAN FDD cell is
unknown as specified in section 5.4a.

The test parameters are given in Table A.5.0M, A.5.0N and A.5.0O below.
The test consists of two successive time periods, with time durations of
T1 and T2 respectively. At the start of time duration T1, the UE does
not have any timing information of Cell 2. No compressed mode patterns
are configured in the test case.

The UTRAN shall send a Handover from UTRAN command with activation time
\"now\" with a new active cell, cell 2. In the E-UTRAN Handover command
contained in that message, the IE starting time shall not be included.
The RRC HANDOVER FROM UTRAN COMMAND message shall be sent to the UE
towards the end of the time period T1. The start of T2 is defined as the
end of last TTI containing the handover command.

### A.5.4c.2 Test Requirements

The UE shall start to transmit the PRACH to Cell 2 less than 165 ms from
the beginning of time period T2.

The rate of correct handovers observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

NOTE: The handover delay is expressed as: RRC procedure delay +
T~interrupt~, where:

T~interrupt~ also includes time to detect E-UTRAN FDD cell; see section
5.4a.2.2.

A.5.4d Inter-system Handover from UTRAN FDD to E-UTRAN TDD; Unknown Target Cell
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### A.5.4d.1 Test Purpose and Environment

This test is to verify the requirement for the UTRAN FDD to E-UTRAN TDD
handover requirements for the case when the target E-UTRAN FDD cell is
unknown as specified in section 5.4b.

The test parameters are given in Table A.5.0P, A.5.0Q and A.5.0R below.
The test consists of two successive time periods, with time durations of
T1 and T2 respectively. At the start of time duration T1, the UE does
not have any timing information of Cell 2. No compressed mode patterns
are configured in the test case.

The UTRAN shall send a Handover from UTRAN command with activation time
\"now\" with a new active cell, cell 2. In the E-UTRAN Handover command
contained in that message, the IE starting time shall not be included.
The RRC HANDOVER FROM UTRAN COMMAND message shall be sent to the UE
towards the end of the time period T1. The start of T2 is defined as the
end of last TTI containing the handover command.

### A.5.4d.2 Test Requirements

The UE shall start to transmit the PRACH to Cell 2 less than 160 ms from
the beginning of time period T2.

The rate of correct handovers observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

NOTE: The handover delay is expressed as: RRC procedure delay +
T~interrupt~, where:

T~interrupt~ also includes time to detect E-UTRAN TDD cell; see section
5.4b.2.2.

A.5.5 Cell Re-selection in CELL\_FACH
-------------------------------------

### A.5.5.1 One frequency present in neighbour list and FACH measurement occasions configured

#### A.5.5.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify the requirement for the cell
re-selection delay in CELL\_FACH state in the single carrier case
reported in section 5.5.2.1.1.

The test parameters are given in Table A.5.1 and A.5.2. The UE is
requested to monitor neighbouring cells on 1 carrier. The maximum
repetition period of the relevant system info blocks that needs to be
received by the UE to camp on a cell shall be 1280 ms

#### A.5.5.1.2 Test Requirements

The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 1, and starts to
send preambles on the PRACH for sending the the CELL UPDATE message with
cause value \"cell reselection\" in Cell 1.

The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 1.6 s.

The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%.

NOTE: The cell re-selection delay in this case is expressed as:
$T_{\text{reselection},\text{\ intra}} = T_{\text{Measurement\_Period\ Intra}} + T_{\text{IU}} + \text{20} + T_{\text{SI}} + T_{\text{RA}}$ms,

where:

T~Measurement\_Period\ Intra~ is specified in 8.4.2.2.2 as 200 ms in
this case.

T~SI~: The time required for receiving all the relevant system
information data according to the reception procedure and the RRC
procedure delay of system information blocks defined in 25.331 for a
UTRAN cell.1280 ms is assumed in this test case.

NOTE: Since 1280 ms is one of the typical values for repeating system
information blocks, T~SI~ of 1280 ms could be increased by the RRC
procedure delay in order to allow the SIB repetition period of 1280 ms

T~RA~:T~RA~ is a delay is caused by the physical random access procedure
described in TS 25.214 section 6.1. A persistence value is assumed to be
1 in this test case and therefore T~RA~ in this test case is 40 ms.

This gives a total of 1.55 s, allow 1.6 s in the test case.

### A.5.5.1A One frequency present in neighbour list and HS-DSCH DRX configured

#### A.5.5.1A.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify the requirement for the cell
re-selection delay in CELL\_FACH state in the single carrier case
reported in section 5.5.2.1.1.

The test parameters are given in Table A.5.2A and A.5.2B. The UE is
requested to monitor neighbouring cells on 1 carrier. The maximum
repetition period of the relevant system info blocks that needs to be
received by the UE to camp on a cell shall be 1280 ms. HS-DSCH first DRX
cycle shall be configured

#### A.5.5.1A.2 Test Requirements

The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 1, and starts to
send preambles on the PRACH for sending the the CELL UPDATE message with
cause value \"cell reselection\" in Cell 1.

The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 3 s.

The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%.

NOTE: The cell re-selection delay in this case is expressed as:
$T_{\text{reselection},\text{\ intra}} = T_{\text{Measurement\_Period\ Intra}} + T_{\text{IU}} + \text{20} + T_{\text{SI}} + T_{\text{RA}}$ms,

where:

T~Measurement\_Period\ Intra~ is specified in 8.4A.2.2.2 as 1600 ms in
this case.

T~SI~: The time required for receiving all the relevant system
information data according to the reception procedure and the RRC
procedure delay of system information blocks defined in 25.331 for a
UTRAN cell.1280 ms is assumed in this test case.

NOTE: Since 1280 ms is one of the typical values for repeating system
information blocks, T~SI~ of 1280 ms could be increased by the RRC
procedure delay in order to allow the SIB repetition period of 1280 ms

T~RA~:T~RA~ is a delay is caused by the physical random access procedure
described in TS 25.214 section 6.1. A persistence value is assumed to be
1 in this test case and therefore T~RA~ in this test case is 40 ms.

This gives a total of 2.95 s, allow 3 s in the test case.

### A.5.5.1B One frequency present in neighbour list and HS-DSCH 2^nd^ DRX configured

#### A.5.5.1B.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify the requirement for the cell
re-selection delay in CELL\_FACH state in the single carrier case
reported in section 5.5.2.1.1.

The test parameters are given in Table A.5.2C and A.5.2D. The UE is
requested to monitor neighbouring cells on 1 carrier. The maximum
repetition period of the relevant system info blocks that needs to be
received by the UE to camp on a cell shall be 1280 ms

#### A.5.5.1B.2 Test Requirements

The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 1, and starts to
send preambles on the PRACH for sending the the CELL UPDATE message with
cause value \"cell reselection\" in Cell 1.

The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 12 s.

The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%.

NOTE: The cell re-selection delay in this case is expressed as:
$T_{\text{reselection},\text{\ intra}} = T_{\text{Measurement\_Period\ Intra}} + T_{\text{IU}} + \text{20} + T_{\text{SI}} + T_{\text{RA}}$ms,

where:

T~Measurement\_Period\ Intra~ is specified in 8.4A.2.2.2 as 10240 ms in
this case.

T~SI~: The time required for receiving all the relevant system
information data according to the reception procedure and the RRC
procedure delay of system information blocks defined in 25.331 for a
UTRAN cell.1280 ms is assumed in this test case.

NOTE: Since 1280 ms is one of the typical values for repeating system
information blocks, T~SI~ of 1280 ms could be increased by the RRC
procedure delay in order to allow the SIB repetition period of 1280 ms

T~RA~:T~RA~ is a delay is caused by the physical random access procedure
described in TS 25.214 section 6.1. A persistence value is assumed to be
1 in this test case and therefore T~RA~ in this test case is 40 ms.

This gives a total of 11.59 s, allow 12 s in the test case.

### A.5.5.1C One frequency present in neighbour list and FACH measurement occasions configured, secondary BCH in use

#### A.5.5.1C.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify the requirement for the cell
re-selection delay in CELL\_FACH state in the single carrier case
reported in section 5.5.2.1.1.

The test parameters are given in Table A.5.2E, A.5.2F and A.5.2G. The UE
is requested to monitor neighbouring cells on 1 carrier. The maximum
repetition period of the relevant system info blocks transmitted on
P-CCPCH and S-CCPCH that needs to be received by the UE to camp on a
cell shall be 1280 ms. It is assumed that the UE decodes system info
blocks on P-CCPCH and S-CCPCH in parallel.

#### A.5.5.1C.2 Test Requirements

The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 1, and starts to
send preambles on the PRACH for sending the CELL UPDATE message with
cause value \"cell reselection\" in Cell 1.

The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 1.6 s.

The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%.

NOTE: The cell re-selection delay in this case is expressed as:
$T_{\text{reselection},\text{\ intra}} = T_{\text{Measurement\_Period\ Intra}} + T_{\text{IU}} + \text{20} + T_{\text{SI}} + T_{\text{RA}}$ms,

where:

T~Measurement\_Period\ Intra~ is specified in 8.4.2.2.2 as 200 ms in
this case.

T~SI~: The time required for receiving all the relevant system
information data according to the reception procedure and the RRC
procedure delay of system information blocks defined in 25.331 for a
UTRAN cell.1280 ms is assumed in this test case.

NOTE: Since 1280 ms is one of the typical values for repeating system
information blocks, T~SI~ of 1280 ms could be increased by the RRC
procedure delay in order to allow the SIB repetition period of 1280 ms

T~RA~:T~RA~ is a delay is caused by the physical random access procedure
described in TS 25.214 section 6.1. A persistence value is assumed to be
1 in this test case and therefore T~RA~ in this test case is 40 ms.

This gives a total of 1.55 s, allow 1.6 s in the test case.

### A.5.5.2 Two frequencies present in the neighbour list and FACH measurement occasions configured

#### A.5.5.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify the requirement for the cell
re-selection delay in CELL\_FACH state in section 5.5.2.1.2.

The test parameters are given in tables A5.3 and A5.4. The UE is
requested to monitor neighbouring cells on 2 carriers. The maximum
repetition period of the relevant system info blocks that needs to be
received by the UE to camp on a cell shall be 1280 ms.

#### A.5.5.2.2 Test Requirements

The cell re-reselection delay is defined as the time from the beginning
of time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 1, and starts
to send preambles on the PRACH for sending the the CELL UPDATE message
with cause value \"cell reselection\" in Cell 1.

The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 1.9 s.

The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%.

NOTE: The cell re-selection delay in this case is expressed as:

$T_{\text{reselection},\text{\ inter}} = T_{\text{Measurement\ inter}} + T_{\text{IU}} + \text{20} + T_{\text{SI}} + T_{\text{RA}}$
ms,

where:

T~measurement\ inter~is specified in 8.4.2.3.2 as 480 ms in this case.

T~SI~: The time required for receiving all the relevant system
information data according to the reception procedure and the RRC
procedure delay of system information blocks defined in 25.331 for a
UTRAN cell.1280 ms is assumed in this test case.

NOTE: Since 1280 ms is one of the typical values for repeating system
information blocks, T~SI~ of 1280 ms could be increased by the RRC
procedure delay in order to allow the SIB repetition period of 1280 ms.

T~RA~: T~RA~ is a delay is caused by the physical random access
procedure described in TS 25.214 section 6.1. A persistence value is
assumed to be 1 in this test case and therefore T~RA~ in this test case
is 40 ms.

This gives a total of 1.83 s, allow 1.9 s in the test case.

### A.5.5.2A Two frequencies present in the neighbour list and HS-DSCH DRX configured (Absolute priority levels not configured)

#### A.5.5.2A.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify the requirement for the cell
re-selection delay in CELL\_FACH state in section 5.5.2.1.2.

This scenario implies the presence of 2 carriers and 6 cells as given in
tables A.5.4AA and A.5.4AB. The UE is requested to monitor neighbouring
cells on 2 carriers. The maximum repetition period of the relevant
system info blocks that needs to be received by the UE to camp on a cell
shall be 1280 ms. Cell 1 and cell 2 shall belong to different Location
Areas.

#### A.5.5.2A.2 Test Requirements

The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 1, and starts to
send preambles on the PRACH for sending the RRC CONNECTION REQUEST
message to perform a Location Registration on cell 1.

The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 2 s.

The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%.

NOTE: The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as:
$T_{\text{reselection},\text{\ inter}} = T_{\text{Measurement,\ inter}} + T_{\text{IU}} + \text{20} + T_{\text{SI}} + T_{\text{RA}}$,

where:

T~measurement,inter~ See section 8.4a.2.3.2 as 480 ms in this case

T~IU~ 10msec

T~SI~ Maximum repetition period of relevant system info blocks that
needs to be received by the UE to camp on a cell. 1280 ms is assumed in
this test case.

T~RA~:T~RA~ is a delay is caused by the physical random access procedure
described in TS 25.214 section 6.1. A persistence value is assumed to be
1 in this test case and therefore T~RA~ in this test case is 40 ms.

This gives a total of 1.83 s, allow 2s in the test case.

### A.5.5.2B Two frequencies present in the neighbour list and HS-DSCH DRX configured (Absolute priority levels configured)

#### A.5.5.2B.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify the requirement for the cell
re-selection delay in CELL\_FACH state in section 5.5.2.1.2.

This scenario implies the presence of 2 carriers and 6 cells as given in
tables A.5.4AC and A.5.4AD. The UE is requested to monitor neighbouring
cells on 2 carriers. The maximum repetition period of the relevant
system info blocks that needs to be received by the UE to camp on a cell
shall be 1280 ms. Cell 1 and cell 2 shall belong to different Location
Areas. The target UTRA carrier (cell 1) shall have higher absolute
priority than the starting carrier (cell 2).

#### A.5.5.2B.2 Test Requirements

The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 1, and starts to
send preambles on the PRACH for sending the RRC CONNECTION REQUEST
message to perform a Location Registration on cell 1.

The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 65 s.

The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%.

NOTE: The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as:
$T_{\text{reselection,}\ \text{\ inter}} = T_{\text{HigherPrioritySeearch}} + T_{\text{identify,\ inter}} + T_{\text{IU}} + \text{20} + T_{\text{SI}} + T_{\text{RA}}$,

where:

T~identify,inter~ See section 8.4a.2.3.2 as 2720 ms in this case

T~IU~ 10msec

T~SI~ Maximum repetition period of relevant system info blocks that
needs to be received by the UE to camp on a cell. 1280 ms is assumed in
this test case.

T~RA~:T~RA~ is a delay is caused by the physical random access procedure
described in TS 25.214 section 6.1. A persistence value is assumed to be
1 in this test case and therefore T~RA~ in this test case is 40 ms.

T~higher\_priority\_search~ is described in section 4.2.2

This gives a total of 64.05 s, allow 65s in the test case.

### A.5.5.2C Two frequencies present in the neighbour list and HS-DSCH 2^nd^ DRX configured (Absolute priority levels not configured)

#### A.5.5.2C.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify the requirement for the cell
re-selection delay in CELL\_FACH state in section 5.5.2.1.2.

This scenario implies the presence of 2 carriers and 6 cells as given in
tables A.5.4AE and A.5.4AF. The UE is requested to monitor neighbouring
cells on 2 carriers. The maximum repetition period of the relevant
system info blocks that needs to be received by the UE to camp on a cell
shall be 1280 ms. Cell 1 and cell 2 shall belong to different Location
Areas. Both UTRA carriers shall have equal priority.

#### A.5.5.2C.2 Test Requirements

The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 1, and starts to
send preambles on the PRACH for sending the RRC CONNECTION REQUEST
message to perform a Location Registration on cell 1.

The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 12 s.

The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%.

NOTE: The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as:
$T_{\text{reselection},\text{\ inter}} = T_{\text{Measurement,\ inter}} + T_{\text{IU}} + \text{20} + T_{\text{SI}} + T_{\text{RA}}$,

where:

T~measurement,inter~ See section 8.4a.2.3.2; as 10240 ms in this case

T~SI~ Maximum repetition period of relevant system info blocks that
needs to be received by the UE to camp on a cell. 1280 ms is assumed in
this test case.

T~IU~ 10msec

T~RA~:T~RA~ is a delay is caused by the physical random access procedure
described in TS 25.214 section 6.1. A persistence value is assumed to be
1 in this test case and therefore T~RA~ in this test case is 40 ms.

This gives a total of 11.6 s, allow 12s in the test case.

### A.5.5.2D Two frequencies present in the neighbour list and HS-DSCH 2^nd^ DRX configured (Absolute priority levels configured)

#### A.5.5.2D.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify the requirement for the cell
re-selection delay in CELL\_FACH state in section 5.5.2.1.2.

This scenario implies the presence of 2 carriers and 6 cells as given in
tables A.5.4AG and A.5.4AH. The UE is requested to monitor neighbouring
cells on 2 carriers. The maximum repetition period of the relevant
system info blocks that needs to be received by the UE to camp on a cell
shall be 1280 ms. Cell 1 and cell 2 shall belong to different Location
Areas. The target UTRA carrier (cell 1) shall have higher absolute
priority than the starting carrier (cell 2).

#### A.5.5.2D.2 Test Requirements

The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 1, and starts to
send preambles on the PRACH for sending the RRC CONNECTION REQUEST
message to perform a Location Registration on cell 1.

The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 92 s.

The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%.

NOTE: The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as:
$T_{\text{reselection,}\ \text{\ inter}} = T_{\text{HigherPrioritySeearch}} + T_{\text{identify,\ inter}} + T_{\text{IU}} + \text{20} + T_{\text{SI}} + T_{\text{RA}}$,

where:

T~identify,inter~ See section 8.4a.2.3.2; 30000 ms in this case

T~SI~ Maximum repetition period of relevant system info blocks that
needs to be received by the UE to camp on a cell. 1280 ms is assumed in
this test case.

T~IU~ 10msec

T~RA~:T~RA~ is a delay is caused by the physical random access procedure
described in TS 25.214 section 6.1. A persistence value is assumed to be
1 in this test case and therefore T~RA~ in this test case is 40 ms.

T~higher\_priority\_search~ is described in section 4.2.2

This gives a total of 91.34 s, allow 92s in the test case.

### A.5.5.2E Five frequencies present in the neighbour list and FACH measurement occasions configured for Increased Carrier Monitoring

#### A.5.5.2E.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify the requirement for the cell
re-selection delay in CELL\_FACH state in section 5.5.2.1.2.

The test parameters are given in tables A5.4AI, A5.4AJ, A5.4AK and
A5.4AL. The UE is requested to monitor neighbouring cells on 5 carriers.
Each repetition of the test consists of five successive time periods,
with time duration of T0, T1, T2, T3 and T4 respectively. In the
initialisation phase and at the start of each repetition of T0, the test
equipment provides signals for cell 1 (serving cell), and selects
frequencies for cells 2, 3 and 4 which are chosen from the 5
inter-frequency layers which are configured in the UE neighbour cell
list as described in general and cell specific parameters. The neighbour
lists of cells 2, 3 and 4 shall include the frequency of cell 1 in the
normal performance group as well as the other frequencies configured to
the UE in the test. The maximum repetition period of the relevant system
info blocks that needs to be received by the UE to camp on a cell shall
be 1280 ms.

#### A.5.5.2E.2 Test Requirements

The cell re-reselection delay is defined as the time from the beginning
of a relevant time period, to the moment when the UE camps on the target
cell, and starts to send preambles on the PRACH for sending the the CELL
UPDATE message with cause value \"cell reselection\" on the target Cell.

This gives a total of

  ------------ ------------------------------------ ---------------------------------------------
  Time phase   Target cell                          Requirement for reselection delay (seconds)
  T1           Cell 2 (normal performance group)    2.5s
  T2           Cell 3 (reduced performance group)   12.9s
  T3           Cell 4 (reduced performance group)   12.9s
  T4           Cell 1 (normal performance group)    2.5s
  ------------ ------------------------------------ ---------------------------------------------

The rate of correct cell reselections to the normal performance group
observed during repeated tests shall be at least 90% and the rate of
correct cell reselections to the reduced performance group observed
during repeated tests shall be at least 90%, with a successful
reselection counted if it is within the required time regardless of the
carrier frequencies involved.

NOTE: The cell re-selection delay in this case is expressed as:

$T_{\text{reselection},\text{\ inter}} = T_{\text{Measurement\ inter}} + T_{\text{IU}} + \text{20} + T_{\text{SI}} + T_{\text{RA}}$
ms,

where:

T~measurement\ inter~is specified in 8.4.2.3.2 as xxx ms in this case.

T~SI~: The time required for receiving all the relevant system
information data according to the reception procedure and the RRC
procedure delay of system information blocks defined in 25.331 for a
UTRAN cell.1280 ms is assumed in this test case.

NOTE: Since 1280 ms is one of the typical values for repeating system
information blocks, T~SI~ of 1280 ms could be increased by the RRC
procedure delay in order to allow the SIB repetition period of 1280 ms.

T~RA~: T~RA~ is a delay is caused by the physical random access
procedure described in TS 25.214 section 6.1. A persistence value is
assumed to be 1 in this test case and therefore T~RA~ in this test case
is 40 ms.

### A.5.5.3 Cell Reselection to GSM

#### A.5.5.3.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify the requirement for the cell
re-selection delay in CELL\_FACH state in section 5.5.2.1.4.

This scenario implies the presence of 1 UTRAN serving cell, and 1 GSM
cell to be re-selected. The UE is requested to monitor neighbouring
cells on 1 UMTS carrier and 6 GSM cells. Test parameters are given in
Table, A.5.4A, A.5.4B, A.5.4C, A.5.4D, A.5.4E.

#### A.5.5.3.2 Test Requirements

The cell re-reselection delay is defined as the time from the beginning
of time period T2, to the moment when the UE starts to transmit the
random access in Cell 2 (the GSM cell).

The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 5.5 + T~RA~ s.

The rate of correct reselections observed during repeated tests shall be
at least 90%.

NOTE: The cell re-selection delay can be expressed

$T_{\text{reselection},\text{\ GSM}} = T_{\text{identify,GSM}} + T_{\text{measurement,\ GSM}} + \text{40} + T_{\text{BCCH}} + T_{\text{RA}}$ms

where:

T~identify,GSM~ Specified in 8.4.2.5.2.1, here it is 2880 ms

T~measurement,\ GSM~ Specified in 5.5.2.1.4, here it is 640 ms

T~BCCH~ According to \[21\], the maximum time allowed to read the BCCH
data, when being synchronized to a BCCH carrier, is 1.9 s.

T~RA~ The additional delay caused by the random access procedure in the
GSM cell. Shall be defined by T1/RF when the test case is further
detailed in TS 34.121.

This gives a total of 5.46 +T~RA~ s, allow 5.5 + T~RA~ s.

#### A.5.5.3A Cell Reselection to GSM in DRX

##### A.5.5.3A.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify the requirement for the cell
re-selection delay in CELL\_FACH state in section 5.5.2.1.4.

This scenario implies the presence of 1 UTRAN serving cell, and 1 GSM
cell to be re-selected. The UE is requested to monitor neighbouring
cells on 1 UMTS carrier and 6 GSM cells. Test parameters are given in
Table, A.5.4E1, A.5.4E2, and A.5.4E3.

##### A.5.5.3.2 Test Requirements

The cell re-reselection delay is defined as the time from the beginning
of time period T2, to the moment when the UE starts to transmit the
random access in Cell 2 (the GSM cell).

The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 2.9 + T~RA~ s.

The rate of correct reselections observed during repeated tests shall be
at least 90%.

NOTE: The cell re-selection delay can be expressed

$T_{\text{reselection},\text{\ GSM}} = T_{\text{identify,GSM}} + T_{\text{measurement,\ GSM}} + \text{40} + T_{\text{BCCH}} + T_{\text{RA}}$ms

where:

T~identify,GSM~ Specified in 8.4.2.5.2.1, here it is 500 ms

T~measurement,\ GSM~ Specified in 5.5.2.1.4, here it is 480 ms

T~BCCH~ According to \[21\], the maximum time allowed to read the BCCH
data, when being synchronized to a BCCH carrier, is 1.9 s.

T~RA~ The additional delay caused by the random access procedure in the
GSM cell. Shall be defined by RAN5 when the test case is further
detailed in TS 34.121.

This gives a total of 2.88 +T~RA~ s, allow 2.9 + T~RA~ s.

### A.5.5.4 Cell Reselection during an MBMS session, two frequencies present in neighbour list

#### A.5.5.4.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify the requirement for the cell
identification for UEs in an MBMS PTM session and the required
functionality on measurement occasions by use of a cell re-selection
test case.

The test parameters are given in tables A.5.4F, A.5.4G, A.5.4H, A.5.4I,
A.5.4J and A.5.4K. The UE is requested to receive the MBMS service and
monitor neighbouring cells on 2 carriers. The maximum repetition period
of the relevant system info blocks that needs to be received by the UE
to camp on a cell shall be 1280 ms.

#### A.5.5.4.2 Test Requirements

The cell re-reselection delay is defined as the time from the beginning
of time period T3, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 1, and starts
to send preambles on the PRACH for sending the CELL UPDATE message with
cause value \"cell reselection\" in Cell 1.

The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 1.9s.

During T1 and T2 the MTCH SDU ER shall not exceed 4.0%.

The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%.

NOTE: The cell re-selection delay in this case is expressed as:

$T_{\text{reselection},\text{\ inter}} = T_{\text{Measuremnt,\ inter}} + T_{\text{IU}} + \text{20} + T_{\text{SI}} + T_{\text{RA}}$
ms,

where:

T~Measuremnt,\ inter~ Specified in 8.4.2.3.2 as 480ms

T~identify,\ inter~i Specified in 8.4.2.3.1 as 2.72 s in this case, thus
3sec for T2 is sufficient for identification of cell 1.

Note: The calculation based on the S-CCPCH carrying the FACH provides a
measurement occasion of 20ms repeated every 80ms. As the MTCH TTI length
is only 40ms this has to be shortened to a gap of 10ms every 80ms, the
re-selection delay is based upon.

T~SI~: The time required for receiving all the relevant system
information data according to the reception procedure and the RRC
procedure delay of system information blocks defined in 25.331 for a
UTRAN cell.1280 ms is assumed in this test case.

Note: Since 1280 ms is one of the typical values for repeating system
information blocks, T~SI~ of 1280 ms could be increased by the RRC
procedure delay in order to allow the SIB repetition period of 1280 ms.

T~RA~: T~RA~ is a delay is caused by the physical random access
procedure described in TS 25.214 section 6.1. A persistence value is
assumed to be 1 in this test case and therefore T~RA~ in this test case
is 40 ms.

Note: The maximum allowed time to be used to perform the measurements
for a UE in an MBMS session may be smaller than the duration of the
measurement occasion to fulfill the MBMS demodulation performance.

This gives a total of 1.83 s, allow 1,9s in the test case.

### A.5.5.5 UTRAN to E-UTRA Cell Reselection

#### A.5.5.5.1 Reselection to E-UTRA FDD when HS-DSCH DRX is configured (E-UTRA has higher priority)

##### A.5.5.5.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment

This test is to verify the requirement for the UTRA FDD to E-UTRA FDD
inter-RAT cell reselection delay reported in section 5.5.2.1.5

The test scenario comprises two different cells, with cell 1 being the
UTRA serving cell and cell 2 being the E-UTRA cell to be re-selected to.
Test parameters are given in Tables A.5.4L, A.5.4M, A.5.4N. The test
consists of two successive time periods, with time duration of T1, T2.
UTRA cell 1 is already identified by the UE prior to the start of the
test. Cell 2 is of higher priority than cell 1.

Cell 1 and cell 2 shall belong to different tracking areas. Furthermore,
UE has not registered with network for the tracking area containing cell
2.

CELL\_FACH with discontinuous HS-DSCH reception should be configured.
The UE should not be scheduled with HS-DSCH data during T1 and T2 such
that the DRX cycle becomes active

The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 2, and starts to
send preambles on the PRACH for sending the RRC CONNECTION REQUEST
message to perform a Tracking Area Update procedure on Cell 2.

The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 66 s.

The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%.

NOTE: The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as:
$T_{\text{reselection},\text{\ E-UTRAN}} = T_{\text{HigherPrioritySearch}} + \text{40} + T_{\text{SI}} + T_{\text{RA}}$,
where:

T~SI~ = the maximum time allowed aquire system information from a
E-UTRAN cell, 1280msec \[24\].

T~RA~ = the additional delay caused by the random access procedure,
30msec \[24\]

T~Identify,,E-UTRAN~ = Time to identify an E-UTRA cell, as defined in
section 8.4a.2.6.1

T~higher\_priority\_search~ is described in section 4.2.2

This gives a total of 67.7, allow 66 s in the test case.

#### A.5.5.5.2 Reselection to E-UTRA FDD when HS-DSCH DRX is configured (E-UTRA has lower priority)

##### A.5.5.5 2.1 Test Purpose and Environment

This test is to verify the requirement for the UTRAN to E-UTRAN cell
reselection delay reported in section 5.5.2.1.5.

This scenario implies the presence of 1 UTRAN serving cell, and 1
E-UTRAN cell to be re-selected. The UE is requested to monitor
neighbouring cells on 1 UTRAN carrier and 1 E-UTRAN carrier. Test
parameters are given in Table, A.5.4O, A.5.4P, A.5.4Q. The test consists
of two successive time periods, with time duration of T1 and T2,
respectively. Both UTRA cell 1 and E-UTRA cell 2 are already identified
by the UE prior to the start of the test. Cell 2 is of lower priority
than cell 1. Cell 1 and cell 2 shall belong to different tracking areas.

CELL\_FACH with discontinuous HS-DSCH reception and with only the first
DRX cycle active should be configured. The UE should not be scheduled
with HS-DSCH data during T1 and T2 such that the DRX cycle becomes
active.

##### A.5.5.5.2.2 Test Requirements

The cell reselection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 2, and starts to
send preambles on the PRACH for sending the RRC CONNECTION REQUEST
message to perform a Tracking Area Update procedure on Cell 2.

The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 5.7 s.

The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%.

$T_{\text{reselection},\text{\ E-UTRAN}} = T_{\text{identify,E-UTRAN}} + \text{40} + T_{\text{SI}} + T_{\text{RA}}$,
where:

T~SI~ = the maximum time allowed aquire system information from a
E-UTRAN cell, 1280msec \[24\].

T~RA~ = the additional delay caused by the random access procedure,
30msec \[24\]

T~Identify,,E-UTRAN~ = Time to identify an E-UTRA cell, as defined in
section 8.4a.2.6.1

This gives a total of 5.61 s, allow 5.7 s in the test case.

#### A.5.5.5.3 Reselection to E-UTRA FDD when HS-DSCH 2^nd^ DRX is configured (E-UTRA has higher priority)

##### A.5.5.5.3.1 Test Purpose and Environment

This test is to verify the requirement for the UTRA FDD to E-UTRA FDD
inter-RAT cell reselection delay reported in section 5.5.2.1.5

The test scenario comprises two different cells, with cell 1 being the
UTRA serving cell and cell 2 being the E-UTRA cell to be re-selected to.
Test parameters are given in Tables A.5.4R, A.5.4S, A.5.4T. The test
consists of two successive time periods, with time duration of T1, T2.
UTRA cell 1 is already identified by the UE prior to the start of the
test. Cell2 shall have higher priority than Cell 1.

Cell 1 and cell 2 shall belong to different tracking areas. Furthermore,
UE has not registered with network for the tracking area containing cell
2.

CELL\_FACH with discontinuous HS-DSCH reception and 2^nd^ DRX cycle
should be configured. The UE should not be scheduled with HS-DSCH data
during T1 and T2 such that the DRX cycle becomes active.

##### A.5.5.5.3.2 Test Requirements

The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 2, and starts to
send preambles on the PRACH for sending the RRC CONNECTION REQUEST
message to perform a Tracking Area Update procedure on Cell 2.

The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 66 s.

The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%.

NOTE: The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as:
$T_{\text{reselection},\text{\ E-UTRAN}} = T_{\text{HigherPrioritySeearch}} + T_{\text{identify,E-UTRAN}} + \text{40} + T_{\text{SI}} + T_{\text{RA}}$,
where:

T~SI~ = the maximum time allowed aquire system information from a
E-UTRAN cell, 1280msec \[24\].

T~RA~ = the additional delay caused by the random access procedure,
30msec \[24\]

T~Identify,,E-UTRAN~ = Time to identify an E-UTRA cell, as defined in
section 8.4a.2.6.1

T~higher\_priority\_search~ is described in section 4.2.2

This gives a total of 65.67, allow 66 s in the test case.

#### A.5.5.5.4 Reselection to E-UTRA TDD when HS-DSCH DRX is configured (E-UTRA has higher priority)

##### A.5.5.5.4.1 Test Purpose and Environment

This test is to verify the requirement for the UTRA FDD to E-UTRA TDD
inter-RAT cell reselection delay reported in section 5.5.2.1.5

The test scenario comprises two different cells, with cell 1 being the
UTRA serving cell and cell 2 being the E-UTRA cell to be re-selected to.
Test parameters are given in Tables A.5.4U, A.5.4V, A.5.4W. The test
consists of two successive time periods, with time duration of T1, T2.
UTRA cell 1 is already identified by the UE prior to the start of the
test. Cell 2 is of higher priority than cell 1.

Cell 1 and cell 2 shall belong to different tracking areas. Furthermore,
UE has not registered with network for the tracking area containing cell
2.

CELL\_FACH with discontinuous HS-DSCH reception should be configured.
The UE should not be scheduled with HS-DSCH data during T1 and T2 such
that the DRX cycle becomes active.

##### A.5.5.5.4.2 Test Requirements

The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 2, and starts to
send preambles on the PRACH for sending the RRC CONNECTION REQUEST
message to perform a Tracking Area Update procedure on Cell 2.

The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 66 s.

The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%.

NOTE: The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as:
$T_{\text{reselection},\text{\ E-UTRAN}} = T_{\text{HigherPrioritySeearch}} + T_{\text{identify,E-UTRAN}} + \text{40} + T_{\text{SI}} + T_{\text{RA}}$,
where:

T~SI~ = the maximum time allowed aquire system information from a
E-UTRAN cell, 1280msec \[24\].

T~RA~ = the additional delay caused by the random access procedure,
30msec \[24\]

T~Identify,,E-UTRAN~ = Time to identify an E-UTRA cell, as defined in
section 8.4a.2.6.1

T~higher\_priority\_search~ is described in section 4.2.2

This gives a total of 65.70, allow 66 s in the test case.

#### A.5.5.5.5 Reselection to E-UTRA TDD when HS-DSCH DRX is configured (E-UTRA has lower priority)

##### A.5.5.5.5.1 Test Purpose and Environment

This test is to verify the requirement for the UTRAN to E-UTRAN cell
reselection delay reported in section 5.5.2.1.5.

This scenario implies the presence of 1 UTRAN serving cell, and 1
E-UTRAN cell to be re-selected. The UE is requested to monitor
neighbouring cells on 1 UTRAN carrier and 1 E-UTRAN carrier. Test
parameters are given in Table, A.5.4X, A.5.4Y, A.5.4Z. The test consists
of two successive time periods, with time duration of T1 and T2,
respectively. Both UTRA cell 1 and E-UTRA cell 2 are already identified
by the UE prior to the start of the test. Cell 2 is of lower priority
than cell 1. Cell 1 and cell 2 shall belong to different tracking areas.

CELL\_FACH with discontinuous HS-DSCH reception and with only the first
DRX cycle active should be configured. The UE should not be scheduled
with HS-DSCH data during T1 and T2 such that the DRX cycle becomes
active.

##### A.5.5.5.5.2 Test Requirements

The cell reselection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 2, and starts to
send preambles on the PRACH for sending the RRC CONNECTION REQUEST
message to perform a Tracking Area Update procedure on Cell 2.

The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 5.7 s.

The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%.

$T_{\text{reselection},\text{\ E-UTRAN}} = T_{\text{identify,E-UTRAN}} + \text{40} + T_{\text{SI}} + T_{\text{RA}}$,
where:

T~SI~ = the maximum time allowed aquire system information from a
E-UTRAN cell, 1280msec \[24\].

T~RA~ = the additional delay caused by the random access procedure,
30msec \[24\]

T~Identify,,E-UTRAN~ = Time to identify an E-UTRA cell, as defined in
section 8.4a.2.6.1

This gives a total of 5.61 s, allow 5.7s in the test case.

#### A5.5.5.6 Reselection to E-UTRA TDD when HS-DSCH 2^nd^ DRX is configured configured (E-UTRA has higher priority)

##### A.5.5.5.6.1 Test Purpose and Environment

This test is to verify the requirement for the UTRA FDD to E-UTRA TDD
inter-RAT cell reselection delay reported in section 5.5.2.1.5

The test scenario comprises two different cells, with cell 1 being the
UTRA serving cell and cell 2 being the E-UTRA cell to be re-selected to.
Test parameters are given in Tables A.5.4ZA, A.5.4ZB, A.5.4ZC. The test
consists of two successive time periods, with time duration of T1, T2.
UTRA cell 1 is already identified by the UE prior to the start of the
test. Cell 2 shall have higher priority than Cell 1.

Cell 1 and cell 2 shall belong to different tracking areas. Furthermore,
UE has not registered with network for the tracking area containing cell
2.

CELL\_FACH with discontinuous HS-DSCH reception and 2^nd^ DRX cycle
should be configured. The UE should not be scheduled with HS-DSCH data
during T1 and T2 such that the DRX cycle becomes active

##### A.5.5.5.6.2 Test Requirements

The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 2, and starts to
send preambles on the PRACH for sending the RRC CONNECTION REQUEST
message to perform a Tracking Area Update procedure on Cell 2.

The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 66 s.

The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%.

NOTE: The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as:
$T_{\text{reselection},\text{\ E-UTRAN}} = T_{\text{HigherPrioritySeearch}} + T_{\text{identify,E-UTRAN}} + \text{40} + T_{\text{SI}} + T_{\text{RA}}$,
where:

T~SI~ = the maximum time allowed aquire system information from a
E-UTRAN cell, 1280msec \[24\].

T~RA~ = the additional delay caused by the random access procedure,
30msec \[24\]

T~Identify,,E-UTRAN~ = Time to identify an E-UTRA cell, as defined in
section 8.4a.2.6.1

T~higher\_priority\_search~ is described in section 4.2.2

This gives a total of 65.70, allow 66 s in the test case.

#### A.5.5.5.7 Reselection to E-UTRA FDD with FACH measurement occasions configured

##### A.5.5.5.7.1 Test Purpose and Environment

This test is to verify the requirement for the UTRAN to E-UTRA cell
re-selection delay reported in section 5.5.2.1.5 with measurement
occasions configured.

This scenario implies the presence of 1 UTRAN serving cell, and 1 E-UTRA
FDD cell to be re-selected. The UE is requested to monitor neighbouring
cells on 2 UMTS carriers, 12 GSM cells and 1 E-UTRA FDD carrier. Test
parameters are given in Table, A.5.4ZF, A.5.4ZG and A.5.4ZH. During time
phase T1, the E-UTRA cell can be identified but is not sufficiently
strong to trigger reselection. Cell 2 is of higher priority than cell 1.
The GERAN neighbour cells are not assigned any absolute priority.

The transport and physical parameters of the S-CCPCH carrying the FACH
are defined in Table A.5.4ZD and Table A.5.4ZE.

##### A.5.5.5.7.2 Test Requirements

The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 2, and starts to
send preambles on the PRACH for sending the RRC CONNECTION REQUEST
message to perform a Tracking Area Update procedure on Cell 2.

The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 2.5 s.

The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%.

NOTE1:      The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as:

$T_{\text{reselection},\text{\ E-UTRAN}} = T_{\text{measurement,\ E-UTRAN}} + \text{40} + T_{\text{BCCH}} + T_{\text{RA}}$
ms

where

T~measurement,,E-UTRAN~ = Time to measure E-UTRA RSRP or RSRQ, as
defined in section 8.4.2.6.2, 1120ms.

T~BCCH~ = The maximum time allowed to read BCCH data from the E-UTRAN
cell, 1280ms \[24\].T~RA~ =  the additional delay caused by the random
access procedure, 30msec \[24\]

This gives a total of 2460ms, allow 2.5 seconds in the test case.

NOTE2: The reselection delay is based on N~freq~=2 since measurements of
GERAN are not required by the higher layers in this scenario.

#### A.5.5.5.8 Reselection to E-UTRA TDD with FACH measurement occasions configured

##### A.5.5.5.8.1 Test Purpose and Environment

This test is to verify the requirement for the UTRAN to E-UTRA cell
re-selection delay reported in section 5.5.2.1.5 with measurement
occasions configured.

This scenario implies the presence of 1 UTRAN serving cell, and 1 E-UTRA
TDD cell to be re-selected. The UE is requested to monitor neighbouring
cells on 2 UMTS carriers, 12 GSM cells and 1 E-UTRA TDD carrier. Test
parameters are given in Table, A.5.4ZK, A.5.4ZL and A.5.5.4ZM. During
time phase T1, the E-UTRA cell can be identified but is not sufficiently
strong to trigger reselection. Cell 2 is of higher priority than cell 1.
The GERAN neighbour cells are not assigned any absolute priority.

The transport and physical parameters of the S-CCPCH carrying the FACH
are defined in Table A.5.4ZI and Table A.5.4ZJ.

##### A.5.5.5.8.2 Test Requirements

The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 2, and starts to
send preambles on the PRACH for sending the RRC CONNECTION REQUEST
message to perform a Tracking Area Update procedure on Cell 2.

The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 2.5 s.

The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%.

NOTE1: The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as:

$T_{\text{reselection},\text{\ E-UTRAN}} = T_{\text{measurement,\ E-UTRAN}} + \text{40} + T_{\text{BCCH}} + T_{\text{RA}}$
ms

where

T~measurement,,E-UTRAN~ = Time to measure E-UTRA RSRP or RSRQ, as
defined in section 8.4.2.6.2, 1120ms.

T~BCCH~ = The maximum time allowed to read BCCH data from the E-UTRAN
cell, 1280ms \[24\].

T~RA~ =  the additional delay caused by the random access procedure,
30msec \[24\]

This gives a total of 2460ms, allow 2.5 seconds in the test case.

NOTE2: The reselection delay is based on N~freq~=2 since measurements of
GERAN are not required by the higher layers in this scenario.

A.5.6 Cell Re-selection in CELL\_PCH
------------------------------------

### A.5.6.1 One frequency present in the neighbour list

#### A.5.6.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify the requirement for the cell
re-selection delay in CELL\_PCH state in section 5.6.2.

The test parameters are given in Table A5.5 and A5.6. The UE is
requested to monitor neighbouring cells on 1 carrier. The maximum
repetition period of the relevant system info blocks that needs to be
received by the UE to camp on a cell shall be 1280 ms.

#### A.5.6.1.2 Test Requirements

The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 1, and starts to
send preambles on the PRACH for sending the CELL UPDATE message with
cause value \"cell reselection\" in Cell 1.

The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 8 s.

The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%.

NOTE: The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as: T~evaluateFDD~ +
T~SI~,

where:

T~evaluateFDD:~ See section 5.6.2.

T~SI~ : Maximum repetition period of relevant system info blocks that
needs to be received by the UE to camp on a cell. 1280 ms is assumed in
this test case.

This gives a total of 7.68 s, allow 8s in the test case.

### A.5.6.2 Two frequencies present in the neighbour list

#### A.5.6.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify the requirement for the cell
re-selection delay in CELL\_PCH state in section 5.6.2. The UE is
requested to monitor neighbouring cells on 2 carriers. The maximum
repetition period of the relevant system info blocks that needs to be
received by the UE to camp on a cell shall be 1280 ms.

#### A.5.6.2.2 Test Requirements

The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 1, and starts to
send preambles on the PRACH for sending the CELL UPDATE message with
cause value \"cell reselection\" in Cell 1.

The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 8 s.

The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%.

NOTE: The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as: T~evaluateFDD~ +
T~SI~,

where:

T~evaluateFDD~: See section 5.6.2.

T~SI~: Maximum repetition period of relevant system info blocks that
needs to be received by the UE to camp on a cell. 1280 ms is assumed in
this test case.

This gives a total of 7.68 s, allow 8s in the test case.

### A.5.6.3 Cell re-selection during an MBMS session, one UTRAN inter-frequency and 2 GSM cells present in the neighbour list 

#### A.5.6.3.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify the requirement for the GSM BSIC
identification for UEs in an MBMS PTM session according to section
4.2.2.3 and 4.2.2.5. Furthermore, the required functionality on the
limitation of measurements in dependence of the MBMS TTI as specified in
section 4.2.2.9 are tested.

This scenario implies the presence of 1 UTRAN serving cell, 1 UTRAN
inter-frequency cell and 2 GSM cells of which one is to be re-selected.
The UE is requested to monitor neighbor cells on 2 UMTS carriers
(Channel 1, Channel 2) and 12 GSM cells. Test parameters are given in
Tables A.5.8A, A5.8B, A.5.8C, A.5.8D and A.5.8E.

#### A.5.6.3.2 Test Requirements

The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
time period T3, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 3, and starts to
send the RR Channel Request message for location update to Cell 3.

The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 2,75 s + T~BCCH,~ where
T~BCCH~ is the maximum time allowed to read BCCH data from GSM cell
\[21\].

During T1 and T2 the MTCH SDU ER shall not exceed 4.0%.

The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%.

NOTE: The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as: Max(3\*
T~measureFDD~, T~measureGSM~+DRX cycle length) + T~BCCH~, where:

T~measureFDD~ See Table 4.1 in section 4.2.2.

T~measureGSM~ See Table 4.1 in section 4.2.2.

DRX cycle length 160mss see Table A.4.7.A

T~BCCH~ Maximum time allowed to read BCCH data from GSM cell \[21\].\
According to \[21\], the maximum time allowed to read the BCCH data,
when being synchronized to a BCCH carrier, is 1.9 s.

This gives a total of 2.72 s + T~BCCH~, allow 2.75 s + T~BCCH~ in the
test case.

### A.5.7.1 One frequency present in the neighbour list

#### A.5.7.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify the requirement for the cell
re-selection delay in URA\_PCH state in section 5.7.2.

The test parameters are given in Table A.5.9 and A.5.10. The UE is
requested to monitor neighbouring cells on 1 carrier. The maximum
repetition period of the relevant system info blocks that needs to be
received by the UE to camp on a cell shall be 1280 ms.

Cells possible for re-selection shall belong to different UTRAN
Registration Areas (URA).

#### A.5.7.1.2 Test Requirements

The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 1, and starts to
send preambles on the PRACH for sending the URA UPDATE message with
cause value \"URA reselection\" in Cell 1.

The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 8 s.

The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%.

NOTE: The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as: T~evaluateFDD~ +
T~SI~,

where:

T~evaluateFDD~: See section 5.7.2.

T~SI~: Maximum repetition period of relevant system info blocks that
needs to be received by the UE to camp on a cell. 1280 ms is assumed in
this test case.

This gives a total of 7.68 s, allow 8s in the test case.

### A.5.7.2 Two frequencies present in the neighbour list

#### A.5.7.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify the requirement for the cell
re-selection delay in URA\_PCH state in section 5.7.2.

The test parameters are given in Table A5.11 and A5.12. The UE is
requested to monitor neighbouring cells on 2 carriers. The maximum
repetition period of the relevant system info blocks that needs to be
received by the UE to camp on a cell shall be 1280 ms.

Cells possible for re-selection shall belong to different UTRAN
Registration Areas (URA).

#### A.5.7.2.2 Test Requirements

The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 1, and starts to
send preambles on the PRACH for sending URA UPDATE message with cause
value \"URA reselection\" in Cell 1.

The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 8 s.

The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%.

NOTE: The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as: T~evaluateFDD~ +
T~SI~,

where:

T~evaluateFDD~: See section 5.7.2.

T~SI~: Maximum repetition period of relevant system info blocks that
needs to be received by the UE to camp on a cell. 1280 ms is assumed in
this test case.

This gives a total of 7.68 s, allow 8s in the test case.

A.5.8 Serving HS-DSCH cell change
---------------------------------

### A.5.8.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify the requirement for the delay when
performing the serving HS-DSCH cell change in CELL\_DCH state specified
in section 5.10.

The test parameters are given in Table A.5.13 and A.5.14 below. The test
consists of 4 successive time periods, with a time duration of T1, T2,
T3 and T4 respectively. At the start of time duration T1 the UE have
cell 1 and cell 2 in active set and cell 1 as the serving HS-DSCH cell.

Data shall be transmitted continuously to the UE on the HS-DSCH channel.

#### A.5.8.1.1 Test procedure

1\) The test is started at the beginning of T1.

2\) During time period T2 an Event 1D triggered measurement report shall
be sent by the UE.

3\) During time period T3 UTRAN shall send a Physical Channel
Configuration command with activation time now changing serving HS-DSCH
from cell 1 to cell 2. The Physical Channel Configuration message shall
be sent to the UE so that the whole message is available at the UE at
the beginning of T4.

### A.5.8.2 Test Requirements

The UE shall start to transmit the CQI to cell 2 less than 74 ms from
the beginning of time period T4.

The UE shall also start to receive the first HS-SCCH message from cell 2
less than 74 ms from the beginning of time period T4 and transmit the
ACK or NAK which corresponds to the HS-SCCH message.

NOTE: The delay D~cell\_change~ equals the RRC procedure delay defined
in TS25.331 Section 13.5.2 plus the interruption time of receiving
HS-DSCH data stated in section 5.10.2.2.\
The RRC procedure delay is 50 ms and the interruption time is given by
Tinterrupt1=T~IU~+22 ms=24 ms.

The total delay D~cell\_change~=50 + 24 ms = 74 ms.

A.5.9 Enhanced Serving HS-DSCH cell change
------------------------------------------

### A.5.9.1 Test Purpose and Environment

This test case is only applicable to UEs which support enhanced HS-DSCH
serving cell change.

The purpose of this test is to verify the requirement for the delay when
performing the enhanced serving HS-DSCH cell change in CELL\_DCH state
specified in section 5.11.

The test parameters are given in Table A.5.15 and A.5.16 below. The test
consists of 4 successive time periods, with a time duration of T1, T2,
T3 and T4 respectively. At the start of time duration T1 the UE has cell
1 and cell 2 in the active set and cell 1 as the serving HS-DSCH cell.
Target cell preconfiguration is provided for cell 2 in the active set
update. The target cell preconfiguration shall not contain the optional
IE "Activation time offset". After sending event 1D during time period
T2, the UE should start to monitor HS-SCCH-1 from cell 2. A single
HS-SCCH order implying serving cell change starts to be transmitted from
cell 2 during T3. By the start of T4, the single HS-SCCH order implying
serving cell change completes transmission, and within the time
specified in section 5.11 the UE shall also be monitoring the HS-SCCH-2
on target cell 2.

Data shall be transmitted continuously to the UE on the HS-DSCH channel
of cell 1 during T1 and T2, and on the HS-DSCH channel of cell2 during
T4.

#### A.5.9.1.1 Test procedure

1\) The test is started at the beginning of T1.

2\) During time period T2 an Event 1D triggered measurement report shall
be sent by the UE.

3\) During time period T3 UTRAN shall send an HS-SCCH order on
HS-SCCH-1from cell 2 implying enhanced serving HS-DSCH from cell 1 to
cell 2. The HS-SCCH order message shall be sent to the UE so that the
end of the TTI containing the HS-SCCH order corresponds to the beginning
of T4.

4\) At the start of T4, UTRAN shall transmit data to the UE using
HS-SCCH-2 and HS-PDSCH on cell 2. Any ACK/NACK received from the UE
indicates that the UE is monitoring HS-SCCH-2

### A.5.9.2 Test Requirements

The UE shall start to receive the first HS-SCCH message on HS-SCCH-2
from cell 2 within no more than 40 ms from the beginning of time period
T4 and transmit the ACK or NACK which corresponds to the HS-SCCH
message.

Note: Since HS-SCCH-2 on cell 2 is the only HS-SCCH which is being
transmitted from the start of T4, either ACK or NACK transmission from
the UE after the start of T4 implies that the enhanced serving cell
change has been completed.

The rate of correct serving cell changes observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%.

A.5.10 Intrafrequency System information acquisition for CSG cell
-----------------------------------------------------------------

### A.5.10.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify the requirement for intrafrequency
CSG SI acquisition in section 5.13.2. The test parameters are given in
Table A.5.17 and A.5.18 below. In the measurement control information
cell 2 shall be included in the \"Intra-frequency SI Acquisition\" IE.
The test consists of two successive time periods, with time duration of
T1 and T2 respectively. At the start of time duration T1, the UE may not
have any timing information of cell 2.

### A.5.10.2 Test Requirements

The UE shall transmit an Event 1A-triggered measurement report
containing the cell identity and CSG identity of cell 2 and membership
indication sent to false within \[2.71\] seconds from the start of T2

Test requirement = T~identify\ intra~+ T~CSG-SI-Report~

> = 800+ \[630\]+40\*32 from the start of T2
>
> = \[2.71\] seconds.

The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as long as
the reporting criteria are not fulfilled..

The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

NOTE: The actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to 2 x
TTI~UL\ DCCH~ higher than the measurement reporting delays above because
of TTI insertion uncertainty of the measurement report in the UL DCCH.

The measured quality on the DTCH of the UE downlink during T2 shall not
exceed BLER=0.01±30% = 0.013

A.5.11 Interfrequency System information acquisition for CSG cell
-----------------------------------------------------------------

### A.5.11.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify the requirement for interfrequency
CSG SI acquisition in section 5.13.2. The test parameters are given in
Table A.5.19 and A.5.20 below.

The test consists of three successive time periods, with a time duration
T1, T2 and T3. The test parameters are given in tables A.5.19 and A.5.20
below. In the measurement control information it is indicated to the UE
that event-triggered reporting with Event 2C shall be used. The CPICH
Ec/Io of the best cell on the unused frequency shall be reported
together with Event 2C reporting. At the start of time duration T1, the
UE may not have any timing information of cell 2.

During T2, the UE shall transmit a measurement report with event 2C, and
UTRAN shall respond with a measurement control message which
reconfigures interfrequency measurements with the Inter-frequency SI
Acquisition IE containing the PSC of cell 2.The start of T3 is defined
as the end of the last TTI containing this measurement control message.

### A.5.11.2 Test Requirements

The UE shall transmit a measurement report containing the cell identity,
CSG identity of cell 2 and membership indication set to FALSE within
\[1.96\] seconds from the start of T3.

Test requirement = RRC Procedure delay + T~CSG-SI-Report~

= 50+ \[630\]+40\*32 from the start of T3

= \[1.96\] seconds.

The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as long as
the reporting criteria are not fulfilled..

The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

NOTE: The actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to 2 x
TTI~UL\ DCCH~ higher than the measurement reporting delays above because
of TTI insertion uncertainty of the measurement report in the UL DCCH.

The measured quality on the DTCH of the UE downlink measured from the
start of T3 until 1.96 seconds after the start of T3 using loopback
shall not exceed BLER= 0.612

a\) NOTE: The test BLER is defined from the requirements as follows:

b\) 600ms of downlink interruption and 600ms of uplink interruption may
occur = 30 DTCH TTI

c\) Due to loopback delay (up to 10 TTI), this means that 30 + 30 = 60
TTI loopback throughput may be lost due to gaps in uplink and downlink

d\) There are 98 TTI in the test interval (1.96 seconds)

e\) The remaining 98-60 = 38 TTI should have a BLER not exceeding
0.001+30% = 0.0013

Overall maximum allowed BLER is (38/98)\*0.0013 + (60/98)\*1 = 0.612

A.6 RRC Connection Control
==========================

A.6.1 RRC Re-establishment delay
--------------------------------

### A.6.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose is to verify that the RRC re-establishment delay is within
the specified limits. These tests will verify the requirements in
section 6.1.2.

#### A.6.1.1.1 TEST 1

The test parameters are given in table A.6.1 and table A.6.2 below. In
the measurement control information it is indicated to the UE that
periodic reporting shall be used. The test consist of 2 successive time
periods, with a time duration of T1 and T2 respectively. At the start of
time period T2, the dedicated channel is removed.

than 1.9s.

The rate of correct RRC re-establishments observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%.

NOTE: The Re-establishment delay in this case can be expressed as

T~RE-ESTABLISH~= T~RRC-RE-ESTABLISH~+ T~UE-RE-ESTABLISH-REQ-KNOWN~.

where

T~RRC-RE-ESTABLISH~=160ms+(N~313~-1)\*10ms+T~313~

T~UE-RE-ESTABLISH\_REQ-KNOWN~=50ms+T~search~ + T~SI~ + T~RA~,

T~313~=0s

T~search~=100ms

T~RA~ = The additional delay caused by the random access procedure. 40
ms is assumed in this test case.

T~SI~ is the time required for receiving all the relevant system
information data according to the reception procedure and the RRC
procedure delay of system information blocks defined in 25.331 for a
UTRAN cell (ms). 1280 ms is assumed in this test case.

This gives a total of 1820ms, allow 1.9s in the test case.

#### A.6.1.2.2 Test 2

The Re-establishment delay to an unknown cell shall be less than 4.2s.

The rate of correct RRC re-establishments observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%.

NOTE: The Re-establishment delay in this case can be expressed as

T~RE-ESTABLISH~= T~RRC-RE-ESTABLISH~+ T~UE-RE-ESTABLISH-REQ-UNKNOWN~.

where

T~RRC-RE-ESTABLISH~=160ms+(N~313~-1)\*10ms+T~313~

T~UE-RE-ESTABLISH-REQ-UNKNOWN~=50ms+T~search~\*NF + T~SI~ + T~RA~,

T~313~=0s

T~search~=800ms

*NF* is the number of different frequencies in the monitored set. 3
frequencies are assumed in this test case.

T~RA~ = The additional delay caused by the random access procedure. 40
ms is assumed in this test case.

T~SI~ is the time required for receiving all the relevant system
information data according to the reception procedure and the RRC
procedure delay of system information blocks defined in 25.331 for a
UTRAN cell (ms).1280 ms is assumed in this test case.

This gives a total of 4120ms, allow 4.2s in the test case.

The radio conditions in the test shall be sufficient, so that decoding
of the TPC commands can be made without errors.

The amount of available user data shall be sufficient to allow uplink
transmission at the highest bit rate (UL\_TFC8 or UL\_TFC9) during the
entire test and it shall be ensured that the UE is using UL\_TFC8 or
UL\_TFC9 at the end of T1.

The test shall be performed in the following way:

**Before time period T1:**

The allowed TFCS according to table A.6.10 shall be signalled to the UE.

**During time period T1:**

The system simulator shall ensure that the UE output power is commanded
to be between 14 to 15 dB below the UE Maximum allowed UL TX power.

**During time period T2:**

The system simulator shall continously send TPC\_cmd=1 to the UE from
the beginning of T2 until the end of T2.

NOTE: This will emulate that UL\_TFC8 to UL\_TFC9 can not be supported
beacuse the UE reaches the maximum UL Tx power and still UTRAN is
sending power-up commands. The time from the beginning of T2 until the
UE blocks (stops using) UL\_TFC8 and UL\_TFC9 shall be measured.

#### A.6.4.1.2 Interactive or Background, PS, UL: 64 kbps + *Conversational / speech, CS, UL: 12.2kbps*

The test will verify the general requirement on TFC selection in section
6.4 for a RAB intended for circuit switched and packet data services,
i.e. Interactive or Background, PS, UL: 64kbps + Conversational / speech
/ CS UL:12.2kbps as defined in TS 34.108 \[3\].

The test parameters are given in Table A.6.8a , A.6.9a and Table A.6.10a
below. The test consists of 2 successive time periods, with a time
duration of T1 and T2 respectively.

Details on the UL reference RAB in table A.6.8a and A.6.9a can be found

The radio conditions in the test shall be sufficient, so that decoding
of the TPC commands can be made without errors.

The amount of available user data shall be sufficient to allow uplink
transmission at the highest bit rate (UL\_TFC28 or UL\_TFC29) during the
entire test and it shall be ensured that the UE is using UL\_TFC28 or
UL\_TFC29 at the end of T1.

The test shall be performed in the following way:

**Before time period T1:**

The allowed TFCS according to table A.6.10a shall be signalled to the
UE.

**During time period T1:**

The system simulator shall ensure that the UE output power is commanded
to be between 14 to 15 dB below the UE Maximum allowed UL TX power.

**During time period T2:**

The system simulator shall continously send TPC\_cmd=1 to the UE from
the beginning of T2 until the end of T2.

NOTE: This will emulate that UL\_TFC28 to UL\_TFC29 can not be supported
beacuse the UE reaches the maximum UL Tx power and still UTRAN is
sending power-up commands. The time from the beginning of T2 until the
UE blocks (stops using) UL\_TFC28 and UL\_TFC29 shall be measured.

### A.6.4.2 Test Requirements

#### A.6.4.2.1 Interactive or Background, PS, UL: 64 kbps

The UE shall have stopped using UL\_TFC8 and UL\_TFC9 within 140 ms from
beginning of time period T2.

The rate of correct tests observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

NOTE: The delay from the begining of T2 can be expressed as:

T~ramp~ + T~detect\_block~ + T~notify~ + T~modify~+ T~L1\_proc~ +
T~align\_TTI~

where:

T~ramp~ Margin added for the increase of UE output power to the UE
maximum power. A margin of 1 frame (10ms) is used, i.e. 15 TPC commands.

T~detect\_block~ The time needed to detect that UL\_TFC8 and UL\_TFC9
can no longer be supported, i.e. defines the maximum time to detect that
the *Elimination* criterion is fulfilled for UL\_TFC8 and UL\_TFC9.
According to X and Y values of 15 and 30 as defined in Section 6.4.2 and
by assuming the maximum misalignment between the frame boundary, where
the evaluation of the *Elimination* criterion is performed and the last
slot needed for triggering the *Elimination* criterion on L1,
T~detect\_block~ becomes 15 slots +14 slots =19.33 ms.

T~notify~ Equal to 15 ms, the time allowed for MAC to indicate to higher
layers that UL\_TFC8 and UL\_TFC9 can no longer be supported.

T~modify~ Equal to MAX(T~adapt\_max~,T~TTI~) = MAX(0, 40)=40ms

T~adapt\_max~ Equals to 0ms for the case without codec.

T~L1\_proc~ Equals 15ms.

T~align\_TTI~ Align with the longest uplink TTI where the new TFC can be
selected. The worst case equals 40ms in this test case.

T~TTI~ See section 6.4.2. Equals 40 ms in the test case.

This gives a maximum delay of (10 + 19.33 + 15 + 40 + 15 + 40) ms=
139.33 ms from the beginning of T2, allow 140 ms in the test case.

#### A.6.4.2.2 Interactive or Background, PS, UL: 64 kbps + *Conversational / speech, CS, UL: 12.2kbps*

The UE shall have stopped using UL\_TFC28 and UL\_TFC29 within 140 ms
from beginning of time period T2.

The rate of correct tests observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

NOTE: The delay from the begining of T2 can be expressed as:

T~ramp~ + T~detect\_block~ + T~notify~ + T~modify~+ T~L1\_proc~ +
T~align\_TTI~

where:

T~ramp~ Margin added for the increase of UE output power to the UE
maximum power. A margin of 1 frame (10ms) is used, i.e. 15 TPC commands.

T~detect\_block~ The time needed to detect that UL\_TFC28 and UL\_TFC29
can no longer be supported, i.e. defines the maximum time to detect that
the *Elimination* criterion is fulfilled for UL\_TFC28 and UL\_TFC9.
According to X and Y values of 15 and 30 as defined in Section 6.4.2 and
by assuming the maximum misalignment between the frame boundary, where
the evaluation of the *Elimination* criterion is performed and the last
slot needed for triggering the *Elimination* criterion on L1,
T~detect\_block~ becomes 15 slots +14 slots =19.33 ms.

T~notify~ Equal to 15 ms, the time allowed for MAC to indicate to higher
layers that UL\_TFC28 and UL\_TFC29 can no longer be supported.

T~modify~ Equal to MAX(T~adapt\_max~,T~TTI~) = MAX(0, 40)=40ms

T~adapt\_max~ Equals to 0ms for the case without codec.

T~L1\_proc~ Equals 15ms.

T~align\_TTI~ Align with the longest uplink TTI where the new TFC can be
selected. The worst case equals 40ms in this test case.

T~TTI~ See section 6.4.2. Equals 40 ms in the test case.

This gives a maximum delay of (10 + 19.33 + 15 + 40 + 15 + 40) ms=
139.33 ms from the beginning of T2, allow 140 ms in the test case.

A.6.6 E-TFC restriction in UE
-----------------------------

### A.6.6.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose is to verify the UE stops using a currently used E-TFC when
its remaining power margin is not sufficient to support that E-TFC, and
resumes using that E-TFC when its remaining power margin is sufficient
to support it. This test will verify the general requirement on E-TFC
selection in section 6.4.

#### A.6.6.1.1 10ms TTI E-DCH E-TFC restriction testcase

The test will verify the general requirement on E-TFC restriction and
recovery in section 6.4 for a 10ms TTI E-DCH Transport Block Size Table
0 \[19\].

The test parameters are given in Table A.6.14 below. The test consists
of 2 time periods, with a time duration of T1 and T2 respectively.

The radio conditions in the test shall be sufficient, so that decoding
of the TPC commands can be made without errors.

The amount of available user data shall be sufficient to allow E-DCH
uplink transmission at the highest possible bit rate with E-DCH TB index
127. It shall also be ensured that sufficient data is made available on
the DTCH so that the UE is continuously transmitting on the DPCH.

The test shall be performed in the following way:

**Initial conditions:**

Call is established with DCH, HSDPA and E-DCH radio bearers. An absolute
grant with the value 31 is sent on the E-AGCH to give the UE sufficient
grants to make use of the maximum possible data rate.

**Before time period T1:**

The UE shall be transmitting at its maximum DPCCH power and the UE
uplink E-DPCCH shall indicate use of E-TFCI with index 0.

**During time period T1:**

From the start of T1 the system simulator shall send sufficient
consecutive TPC\_cmd= -1 to the UE until the DPCCH power is between 0dBm
and 1dBm for a power class 3 UE, or between -4dBm and -3dBm for a power
class 4 UE. Within 45ms from the start of T1, the UE uplink E-DPCCH
shall indicate use of E-TFCI 127, or the E-TFCI which represents the
maximum of the UE's capabilities.

**Before time period T2:**

The UE P~DPCCH~ power shall be between 0dBm and 1dBm for a power class 3
UE, or between -4dBm and -3dBm for a power class 4 UE, and the UE uplink
E-DPCCH shall indicate either be not transmitted or use of E-TFCI 127,
or the E-TFCI which represents the maximum of the UE's capabilities.

**During time period T2:**

The system simulator shall continuously send TPC\_cmd=1 to the UE from
the beginning of T2 until the end of T2. Within 45ms from the start of
T2, the UE uplink E-DPCCH shall indicate use of E-TFCI with index 0.

> NOTE: During this phase the UE may perform DTX of the E-DPDCH in
> accordance with \[18\] clause 5.1.2.6.

Time periods T1 and T2 shall be repeated until the necessary statistical
confidence is achieved.

##### A.6.6.1.1.1 Test Requirements

During time period T1, uplink power control shall be adjusted so that
the UE is able to make use of E-TFC index 127, or the maximum of its
capabilities if this is lower.

NOTE: The required headroom to support E-TFC 127 can be calculated using
the parameters L~ref~=1, K~ref~=18 and K~127~=20000. This requires
{(5006)\*3+12}\*4=60120 before rate matching/ARQ. This can be
transmitted on 2xSF/2 codes, so needs equivalent of 4xSF/4 codes, giving
L~127~=4.

Substituting into the equation for β~ed,j,harq~ from 25.214:

gives

β~ed,j,harq~= 5 \* sqrt (1/4) \* sqrt (20000 / 18) = 83.333

For the SF/2 case, the unquantised gain factor *β~ed,k,j,uq~* for each
of these two codes is according to

*β~ed,k,j,uq~=* *β~ed,k,j,uq~=*

*β~ed,k,j,uq~=* sqrt(2) \* 83.333 = 117.85

*β~ed,k~* is set such that *β~ed,k~*/*β~c~* is the largest quantized
value of Table 1B.2 in \[3\] subclause 4.2.1.3, for which the condition
*β~ed,k~* ≤ *β~ed,k,j,uq~* holds.

According to 25.213 Table 1B.2 in subclause 4.2.1.3, the corresponding
quantised amplitude ratio has index 25,\
A~ed~ = β~ed~/β~c~= 106/15 for each of the two SF/2 E-DPDCH codes.

The E-TFC selection MPR for this case from 25.133 table 6.2 corresponds
to case 6, or an E-TFC MPR of 0.5dB.

$\begin{matrix}
\text{NRPM}j = \left( \text{PMax}_{j} - P_{\text{DPCCH}} - P_{\text{DPDCH}} - P_{\text{HS} - \text{DPCCH}} - P_{E - \text{DPCCH}} \right)/P_{\text{DPCCH}} \\
\frac{\text{PMax}_{j}}{P_{\text{DPCCH}}} - \frac{\beta_{c}^{2} + \beta_{d}^{2} + \beta_{\text{ec}}^{2} + \beta_{\text{hs}}^{2}}{\beta_{c}^{2}} \\
\frac{\text{PMax}_{j}}{P_{\text{DPCCH}}} - \left( 1 + \frac{\beta_{d}^{2}}{\beta_{c}^{2}} + A_{\text{ec}}^{2} + A_{\text{hs}}^{2} \right) \\
\end{matrix}$

For a power class 3 UE PMax~j~ = 23.5dBm = 223.87mW, or for a power
class 4 UE, PMax~j~ = 20.5dBm = 112.20mW

The inequality for support of E-TFC with index 127 is

223.87/P~DPCCH~ - (1+ (9^2^/15^2^) + 2^2^ + 2^2^ ) ≥ 106^2^/15^2^ +
106^2^/15^2^ (class 3)

112.20/P~DPCCH~ - (1+ (9^2^/15^2^) + 2^2^ + 2^2^ ) ≥ 106^2^/15^2^ +
106^2^/15^2^ (class 4)

This is satisfied if P~DPCCH~ ≤ (223.87/109.23) = 2.04mW = 3.11dBm for a
class 3 UE or P~DPCCH~ ≤ (112.20/109.23) = 1.03mW = 0.12dBm for a class
4 UE.

From table 6.0A the accuracy of the P~DPCCH~ estimate used for E-TFC
selection in this scenario is ±2dB for power class 3 or ±2.5dB for power
class 4. Therefore, for P~DPCCH~ ≤ 1.11dBm (class 3) or -2.38dBm (class
4), the UE shall be able to support E-TFC index 127. Since power control
granularity is 1dB, the UE output power should be maintained so that
0dBm ≤ P~DPCCH~ ≤ 1dBm throughout this phase for a class 3 UE, or so
that -4dBm ≤ P~DPCCH~ ≤ -3dBm throughout this phase for a class 4 UE.

NOTE: Test tolerance may need to be added to further reduce the UE DPCCH
power further by RAN5, depending on how accurately tester can set and
maintain UE DPCCH power.

NOTE: The required time to start using E-TFC index 127 or the maximum of
the UEs cababilites at the beginning of T1, and to start using E-TFC
with index 0 at the beginning of T2 can be calculated as follows.

Since TPC commands are received error free by the UE, P~DPCCH~ shall
reach the new power level power within 25 slots = 16.666ms.

The UE shall have evaluated and started to use the new restriction
criteria with T~s~ = (Power level change time + P~DPCCH~ filtering
period + E-TFC estimation rate + Maximum time from RGCH reception to
E-TFC transmission) from the start of the time period

= 16.66ms + 10ms + 10ms + 7.53ms

= 44.19ms, allow 45ms

The rate of correct tests observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

#### A.6.6.1.2 2ms TTI E-DCH E-TFC restriction testcase

The test will verify the general requirement on E-TFC restriction and
recovery in section 6.4 for a 2ms TTI E-DCH Transport Block Size Table 0
\[19\].

The test parameters are given in Table A.6.15 below. The test consists
of 2 time periods, with a time duration of T1 and T2 respectively.

The UE shall be configured to transmit UL DTCH data continuously on the
DPCH. An HSDPA radio bearer shall be configured so that the UE transmits
ACK and UL HS-DPCCH. An E-DCH radio bearer shall be configured, so that
UE is transmitting E-DPCCH and E-DPDCH.

or the E-TFCI which represents the maximum of the UE's capabilities.

**During time period T2:**

The system simulator shall continuously send TPC\_cmd=1 to the UE from
the beginning of T2 until the end of T2. Within 23ms from the start of
T2, the UE uplink E-DPCCH shall indicate use of E-TFCI with index 0.

> NOTE: During this phase the UE may perform DTX of the E-DPDCH in
> accordance with \[18\] clause 5.1.2.6.

**Time periods T1 and T2 shall be repeated until the necessary
statistical confidence is achieved.**

### A.6.6.1.2.1 Test Requirements

During time period T1, uplink power control shall be adjusted so that
the UE is able to make use of E-TFC index 127, or the maximum of its
capabilities if this is lower.

NOTE: The required headroom to support E-TFC 127 can be calculated using
the parameters L~ref~=1, K~ref~=18 and K~127~=11484. This requires
{(3836)\*3+12}\*3 =34560 bits before rate matching/ARQ. This can be
transmitted on 2xSF/2 codes and 2xSF/4 codes, so needs equivalent of
6xSF/4 codes, giving L~127~=6.

Substituting into the equation for β~ed,j,harq~ from 25.214:

gives

βed,j,harq= 5 \* sqrt (1/6) \* sqrt (11484 / 18) = 51.56

For the SF/2 codes, the unquantised gain factor *β~ed,k,j,uq~* for each
of these two codes is according to *β~ed,k,j,uq~=* *β~ed,k,j,uq~=*

ed,k,j,uq= sqrt(2) \* 51.56 = 72.91

And for the SF/4 codes, the unquantised gain factor is *β~ed,k,j,uq~*
=51.56

*β~ed,k~* is set such that *β~ed,k~*/*β~c~* is the largest quantized
value of Table 1B.2 in \[3\] subclause 4.2.1.3, for which the condition
*β~ed,k~* ≤ *β~ed,k,j,uq~* holds.

According to 25.213 Table 1B.2 in subclause 4.2.1.3, the corresponding
quantised amplitude ratio are A~ed~ = β~ed~/β~c~= 67/15 for each of the
two SF/2 E-DPDCH codes and A~ed~ = β~ed~/β~c~= 47/15 for each of the two
SF/4 codes

The E-TFC selection MPR for this case from 25.133 table 6.2 is 0.0dB.

For a power class 3 UE PMax~j~ = 24dBm = 251.2mW, or for a power class 4
UE, PMax~j~ = 21dBm = 125.9mW

The inequality for support of E-TFC with index 127 is

251.2/P~DPCCH~ - (1+ (9^2^/15^2^) + 2^2^ + 2^2^ ) ≥ 47^2^/15^2^ +
47^2^/15^2^ +67^2^/15^2^ + 67^2^/15^2^ (class 3)

125.9/P~DPCCH~ - (1+ (9^2^/15^2^) + 2^2^ + 2^2^ ) ≥ 47^2^/15^2^ +
47^2^/15^2^ +67^2^/15^2^ + 67^2^/15^2^ (class 4)

This is satisfied if P~DPCCH~ ≤ (251.2/68.9) = 3.64mW = 5.61dBm for a
class 3 UE or P~DPCCH~ ≤ (125.9/68.9) = 1.82mW = 2.61dBm for a class 4
UE.

From table 6.0A the accuracy of the Pdpcch estimate used for E-TFC
selection in this scenario is ±2dB for power class 3 or ±2.5dB for power
class 4. Therefore, for P~DPCCH~ ≤ 3.61dBm (class 3) or 0.11dBm (class
4), the UE shall be able to support E-TFC index 127. Since power control
granularity is 1dB, the UE output power should be maintained so that
2dBm ≤ P~DPCCH~ ≤ 3dBm throughout this phase for a class 3 UE, or so
that -1dBm ≤ P~DPCCH~ ≤ 0dBm throughout this phase for a class 4 UE.

NOTE: Test tolerance may need to be added to further reduce the UE DPCCH
power further by RAN5, depending on how accurately tester can set and
maintain UE DPCCH power.

NOTE: The required time to start using E-TFC index 127 or the maximum of
the UEs cababilites at the beginning of T1, and to start using E-TFC
with index 0 at the beginning of T2 can be calculated as follows.

Since TPC commands are received error free by the UE, P~DPCCH~ shall
reach the new power level power within 20 slots = 13.33ms.

The UE shall have evaluated and started to use the new restriction
criteria with T~s~ = (Power level change time + Pdpcch filtering period
+ E-TFC estimation rate + Maximum time from RGCH reception to E-TFC
transmission) from the start of the time period

= 13.33ms + 2ms + 2ms + 5.53ms

= 22.86ms, allow 23ms

The rate of correct tests observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

#### A.8.1.1.2 Test Requirements

The UE shall send one Event 1A triggered measurement report, with a
measurement reporting delay less than 800 ms from the beginning of time
period T2.

The UE shall send one Event 1B triggered measurement report, with a
measurement reporting delay less than 200 ms from the beginning of time
period T3.

The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as long as
the reporting criteria are not fulfilled.

The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

NOTE: The actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to 2 x
TTI~UL\ DCCH~ higher than the measurement reporting delays above because
of TTI insertion uncertainty of the measurement report in the UL DCCH.

### A.8.1.2 Event triggered reporting of multiple neighbours in AWGN propagation condition

#### A.8.1.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE makes correct
reporting of events. This test will partly verify the requirements in
section 8.1.2 and 9.1.

The test parameters are given in Table A.8.3 and A.8.4. In the
measurement control information it is indicated to the UE that
event-triggered reporting with Event 1A, 1C and 1B shall be used and the
periodical reporting of the events is not applied. The test consists of
four successive time periods, with a time duration of T1, T2, T3 and T4
respectively. In the initial condition before the time T1 only Cell1 is
active.

##### A.8.1.7.2 Test Requirements

The UE shall send one Event 1A triggered measurement report, with a
measurement reporting delay less than 1.5 s from the beginning of time
period T2.

The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as long as
the reporting criteria are not fulfilled.

The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

NOTE: The actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to 2 x
TTI~UL\ DCCH~ higher than the measurement reporting delays above because
of TTI insertion uncertainty of the measurement report in the UL DCCH.

A.8.2 FDD inter frequency measurements
--------------------------------------

### A.8.2.1 Correct reporting of neighbours in AWGN propagation condition

#### A.8.2.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE makes correct
reporting of an event when doing inter frequency measurements. The test
will partly verify the requirements in section 8.1.2.3.

The test consists of two successive time periods, with a time duration
T1 and T2. The test parameters are given in tables A.8.9 and A.8.10
below. In the measurement control information it is indicated to the UE
that event-triggered reporting with Event 1A and 2C shall be used. The
CPICH Ec/I0 of the best cell on the unused frequency shall be reported
together with Event 2C reporting.

#### A.8.2.1.2 Test Requirements

a\) The UE shall send one Event 2C triggered measurement report, with a
measurement reporting delay less than 3.4 seconds from the beginning of
time period T1.

b\) The UE shall send one Event 1A triggered measurement report, with a
measurement reporting delay less than 956.2 ms from the beginning of
time period T2.The UE shall not send any measurement reports, as long as
the reporting criteria are not fulfilled.

The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

NOTE: The actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to 2 x
TTI~UL\ DCCH~ higher than the measurement reporting delays above because
of TTI insertion uncertainty of the measurement report in the UL DCCH.

### A.8.2.2 Correct reporting of neighbours in Fading propagation condition

#### A.8.2.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE makes correct
reporting of an event when doing inter frequency measurements. The test
will partly verify the requirements in section 8.1.2.3.The test
parameters are given in Table A.8.11 and A.8.12. In the measurement
control information it is indicated to the UE that event-triggered
reporting 2C shall be used. The test consists of two successive time
periods, each with a time duration of T1 and T2 respectively.

#### A.8.2.2.2 Test Requirements

a\) The UE shall send one Event 2C triggered measurement report, with a
measurement reporting delay less than 13.5 seconds from the beginning of
time period T2.

b\) The UE shall not send any measurement reports, as long as the
reporting criteria are not fulfilled.

The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

### A.8.2.3 Correct reporting of neighbours in fading propagation condition using TGL1=14

#### A.8.2.3.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE makes correct
reporting of an event when doing inter frequency measurements. The test
will partly verify the requirements in section 8.1.2.3. The test
parameters are given in Table A.8.12A and A.8.12B. In the measurement
control information it is indicated to the UE that event-triggered
reporting 2C shall be used. The test consists of two successive time
periods, each with time duration of T1 and T2 respectively.

#### A.8.2A.1.2 Test Requirements

> a\) The UE shall send one Event 2C triggered measurement report, with
> a measurement reporting delay less than 800 ms from the beginning of
> time period T2.
>
> b\) The UE shall send one Event 2E triggered measurement report, with
> a measurement reporting delay less than 200 ms from the beginning of
> time period T3.
>
> c\) The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as long
> as the reporting criteria are not fulfilled.

The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

NOTE: The actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to 2 x
TTI~UL\ DCCH~ higher than the measurement reporting delays above because
of TTI insertion uncertainty of the measurement report in the UL DCCH.

### A.8.2A.2 Event triggered reporting of two detectable neighbours in AWGN propagation condition

#### A.8.2A.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE makes correct
reporting of events. This test will partly verify the requirements in
section 8.1.2 and 9.1.

The test parameters are given in Table A.8.12E and A.8.12F. In the
measurement control information it is indicated to the UE that
event-triggered reporting with Event 2C and 2E shall be used and the
periodical reporting of the events is not applied. The test consists of
four successive time periods, with a time duration of T1, T2, T3 and T4
respectively. In the initial condition before the time T1 only Cell1 is
active.

#### A.8.2A.2.2 Test Requirements

a\) The UE may send one Event 2C triggered measurement report for Cell3,
with a measurement reporting delay less than 800 ms from the beginning
of time period T1, and send one Event 2E triggered measurement report
for Cell3, with a measurement reporting delay less than 200ms from the
beginning of time period T2.

b\) The UE shall send one Event 2C triggered measurement report for
Cell2, with a measurement reporting delay less than 800 ms from the
beginning of time period T2.

c\) The UE shall send one Event 2C triggered measurement report for
Cell3, with a measurement reporting delay less than 200 ms from the
beginning of time period T3.

d\) The UE shall send one Event 2E triggered measurement report for
Cell2, with a measurement reporting delay less than 200 ms from the
beginning of time period T4.

d\) The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as long
as the reporting criteria are not fulfilled.

The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

NOTE: The actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to 2 x
TTI~UL\ DCCH~ higher than the measurement reporting delays above because
of TTI insertion uncertainty of the measurement report in the UL DCCH.

### A.8.2A.3 Correct reporting of neighbours in fading propagation condition

#### A.8.2A.3.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE performs sufficient
layer 1 filtering of the measurements, see section 9.1, which are the
base for the event evaluation. The test is performed in fading
propagation conditions. This test will partly verify the requirements in
section 8.1.2.

The test parameters are given in Table A.8.12G and A.8.12H.In the
measurement control information it is indicated to the UE that
event-triggered reporting with Event 2C and Event 2E shall be used. The
test consists of two successive time periods, each with a time duration
of T1 and T2 respectively.

The TTI of the uplink DCCH shall be 20ms.

A.8.2B FDD inter frequency measurements without compressed mode
---------------------------------------------------------------

### A.8.2B.1 Event triggered reporting using enhanced inter-frequency measurements without compressed mode

The test case under A.8.2B.1 is only applicable to a UE that is able to
search enhanced inter-frequency measurements without compressed mode
according to its measurement capability in the IE "Enhanced
inter-frequency measurements without compressed mode" defined in section
10.3.3.21 of TS 25.331 \[16\].

#### A.8.2B.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE makes correct
reporting of Event 2B when using enhanced inter-frequency measurements
without compressed mode. The test will partly verify the requirements
for "Enhanced inter-frequency measurements without compressed mode" in
section 8.1.2.3.

The test consists of four successive time periods, T1, T2, T3 and T4,
respectively. The test parameters are given in tables A.8.2B.1.1-1 and
A.8.2B.1.1-2 below. In the measurement control information it is
indicated to the UE that event-triggered reporting with Event 2B shall
be used. The CPICH Ec/I0 of the cell on the unused frequency shall be
reported together with Event 2B reporting. As part of the preconditions,
the UE shall use Channel 1 as the serving HS-DSCH cell and Channel 2 and
Channel 3 as the secondary serving HS-DSCH cells.

#### A.8.2B.1.2 Test Requirements

a\) The UE shall send one Event 2B triggered measurement report each for
both Cell 2 and Cell 3 with a measurement reporting delay less than 800
ms from the beginning of time period T2.

b\) The UE shall send one Event 2B triggered measurement report each for
both Cell 2 and Cell 3 with a measurement reporting delay less than 200
ms from the beginning of time period T4.

c\) The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as long
as the reporting criteria are not fulfilled.

The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90% for each of the events and cells in T2 and T4.

A.8.2B.2 Event triggered reporting of inter frequency measurements
without compressed mode for MC-HSDPA

The test case under A.8.2B.2 is only applicable to a UE that is able
perfom inter-frequency measurements without compressed mode for MC-HSDPA
connections according to its measurement capability in the IE
"Inter-frequency measurements on configured carriers without compressed
mode" defined in section 10.3.3.21 of TS 25.331 \[16\].

#### A.8.2B.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to partly verify the requirements for UEs
that does not need compressed mode to measure cells on configured
carrier frequencies corresponding to secondary serving HS-DSCH. The
requirements consist of packet loss requirements specified in section
5.15 and new cell identification time and CPICH measurement period
requirements specified in 8.1.2.3 and applicable sub-clauses.

The test scenario comprises two cells, with cell 1 on carrier frequency
f1 being the serving HS-DSCH cell and cell 2 on carrier frequency f2
being the secondary serving HS-DSCH cell. The activation status of cell
2 is deactivated. Both f1 and f2 are within the same frequency band for
the UE supporting DC-HSDPA, 4C-HSDPA or 8C-HSDPA. For the UE capable of
DB-DC-HSDPA the frequencies f1 and f2 are in different frequency bands.\
DL DRX is not configured. No compressed mode pattern shall be configured
in the test.

The test consists of 2 successive time periods, T1and T2 respectively.
The test parameters are given in tables A.8.2B.2.1-1 and A.8.2B.2.1-2
below.

In the measurement control information it is indicated to the UE that
event-triggered reporting with Event 2C shall be used and that the
monitored set consists of 6 cells including the secondary serving
HS-DSCH cell. The measurement quantity is CPICH Ec/No.

For the verification of packet loss rate requirements the UE shall be
continuously scheduled with HS-DSCH data on the serving HS-DSCH cell
during the test.

### A.8.2C.1 Event triggered reporting of interfrequency detected set measurements with compressed mode

The test case under A.8.2C.1 is only applicable to a UE that is able to
support inter frequency detected set CPICH measurements.

#### A.8.2C.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE makes correct
reporting of an event when doing inter frequency detected set cell
measurements. The test will partly verify the requirements in section
8.1.2.3.

The test consists of four successive time periods, T1, T2, T3 and T4
respectively. The test parameters are given in tables A.8.2C.1.1-1 and
A.8.2C.1.1-2 below. In the measurement control information it is
indicated to the UE that event-triggered reporting with Event 2B shall
be used. The CPICH Ec/Io of the cell on the unused frequency shall be
reported together with Event 2B reporting. Cell 2 shall not be included
in the monitored cell list.

### A.8.2D.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE makes correct
reporting of an event when doing inter frequency measurements. The test
will partly verify the requirements in section 8.1.2.3.

The test consists of two successive time periods, with a time duration
T1 and T2. The test parameters are given in tables A.8.2D.1-1,
A.8.2D.1-2 and A.8.2D.1-3 below. In the measurement control information
it is indicated to the UE that event-triggered reporting with Event 1A
and 2C shall be used. The CPICH Ec/I0 of the best cell on the unused
frequency shall be reported together with Event 2C reporting.

#### A.8.2D.2 Test Requirements

a\) The UE shall send one Event 2C triggered measurement report for cell
2, with a measurement reporting delay less than 6.8 seconds from the
beginning of time period T2.

b\) The UE shall send one Event 2C triggered measurement report for cell
3, with a measurement reporting delay less than 81.6 seconds from the
beginning of time period T2.

c\) The UE shall send one Event 2C triggered measurement report for cell
4, with a measurement reporting delay less than 81.6 seconds from the
beginning of time period T2.

The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

NOTE: The actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to 2 x
TTI~UL\ DCCH~ higher than the measurement reporting delays above because
of TTI insertion uncertainty of the measurement report in the UL DCCH.

#### A.8.2C.2.2 Test Requirements

a\) The UE shall send one Event 2B triggered measurement report with the
IE "Detected Set Trigger" set, with a measurement reporting delay less
than 30 seconds from the beginning of time period T2.

b\) The UE shall send one Event 2B triggered measurement report, with a
measurement reporting delay less than 200 ms from the beginning of time
period T4.

c\) The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as long
as the reporting criteria are not fulfilled.

The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90% for each of the events in T2 and T4.

A.8.2E Correct reporting of neighbours in AWGN propagation condition (Increased UE carrier monitoring without reduced performance group configured)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### A.8.2E.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE makes correct
reporting of an event when doing inter frequency measurements for
increased UE carrier monitoring without reduced performance group
configured. The test will partly verify the requirements in section
8.1.2.3.

The test consists of two successive time periods, with a time duration
T1 and T2. The test parameters are given in tables A.8.2E.1-1,
A.8.2E.1-2 and A.8.2E.1-3 below. In the measurement control information
it is indicated to the UE that event-triggered reporting with Event 2C
shall be used. The CPICH Ec/I0 of the best cell on the unused frequency
shall be reported together with Event 2C reporting. No scaling factor is
configured in this Cell1.

### A.8.2E.2 Test Requirements

a\) The UE shall send one Event 2C triggered measurement report for cell
2, with a measurement reporting delay less than 17 = 50 \* (480/7.05) \*
1\* 5 seconds from the beginning of time period T2.

b\) The UE shall send one Event 2C triggered measurement report for cell
3, with a measurement reporting delay less than 17 seconds from the
beginning of time period T2.

c\) The UE shall send one Event 2C triggered measurement report for cell
4, with a measurement reporting delay less than 17 seconds from the
beginning of time period T2.

Measurement reporting delay can be expressed as:
$T_{\text{measurement}\ \text{\ inter}} = \text{Max}\left\{ T_{\text{Measurement\_Period\ Inter}},T_{\text{basic}\ \text{measurement}\ \text{FDD\ inter}} \cdot \frac{T_{\text{Measurement\_Period\ Inter}}}{T_{\text{Inter}}} \cdot K_{n} \cdot N_{\text{freq},n} \right\}\text{ms}$

which is described in section 8.1.2.3.2.

The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

NOTE: The actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to 2 x
TTI~UL\ DCCH~ higher than the measurement reporting delays above because
of TTI insertion uncertainty of the measurement report in the UL DCCH.

### A.8.4.1 Correct reporting of GSM neighbours in AWGN propagation condition

#### A.8.4.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of these tests is to verify that the UE makes correct
reporting of an event when doing inter-RAT GSM measurements. The test
will partly verify the requirements in section 8.1.2.5. The requirements
are also applicable for a UE not requiring compressed mode, in which
case no compressed mode pattern should be sent for the parameters
specified in table A8.15.

The test consists of three successive time periods, with a time duration
T1, T2 and T3. The test parameters are given in tables A.8.15, A.8.16
and A.8.17 below. In the measurement control information it is indicated
to the UE that event-triggered reporting with Event 3B and 3C shall be
used.

#### A.8.4.1.2 Test Requirements

##### A.8.4.1.2.1 TEST 1 With BSIC verification required

The UE shall send one Event 3C triggered measurement report for Cell2,
with a measurement reporting delay less than 6.24 s from the beginning
of time period T2.

The UE shall send one Event 3B triggered measurement report for Cell2,
with a measurement reporting delay less than 960 ms from the beginning
of time period T3.

The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as long as
the reporting criteria are not fulfilled.

The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

##### A.8.4.1.2.2 TEST 2 Without BSIC verification required

The UE shall send one Event 3C triggered measurement report for Cell2,
with a measurement reporting delay less than 960 ms from the beginning
of time period T2.

The UE shall send one Event 3B triggered measurement report for Cell2,
with a measurement reporting delay less than 960 ms from the beginning
of time period T3.

The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as long as
the reporting criteria are not fulfilled.

The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

A.8.5 Combined Interfrequency and GSM measurements
--------------------------------------------------

### A.8.5.1 Correct reporting of neighbours in AWGN propagation condition

#### A.8.5.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE makes correct
reporting of an event when doing inter frequency and GSM measurements.
The test will partly verify the requirements in section 8.1.2.3 and
8.1.2.5. The requirements are also applicable for a UE not requiring
compressed mode for inter-frequency or inter-RAT GSM measurements. In
case a UE is not requiring compressed mode for inter-frequency
measurements no compressed mode pattern with measurement purpose \"FDD
measurement\" should be sent and in case a UE is not requiring
compressed mode for inter-RAT GSM measurements no compressed mode
pattern with measurement purpose \"GSM carrier RSSI measurements\",
\"GSM Initial BSIC identification\" and \"GSM BSIC re-confirmation\"
should be sent for the parameters specified in table A8.21.

The test consists of five successive time periods, with a time duration
T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5. The test parameters are given in tables A.8.21,
A.8.22 and A.8.23 below. In the measurement control information it is
indicated to the UE that event-triggered reporting with Event 2B and 3A
shall be used as well as periodic reporting with period 4s.

#### A.8.5.1.2 Test Requirements

The UE shall send one Event 2B triggered measurement report for Cell2,
with a measurement reporting delay less than 3.5 s from the beginning of
time period T2.

A handover to cell 2 is signalled to the UE well before end of time
period T3.

The UE shall send one Event 3A triggered measurement report for Cell3,
with a measurement reporting delay less than 6.24 s from the beginning
of time period T4.

The UE shall indicate that the BSIC of the GSM carrier is not verified
in a periodic report sent before 9.04 seconds have passed since the
start of time period T5.

NOTE: The delay for interfrequency cell detection is equal to:

$T_{\text{identify,}\ \text{\ inter}} = T_{\text{basic}\ \text{identify}\ \text{FDD,inter}} \cdot \frac{T_{\text{Measurement}\ \text{\ Period,\ Inter}}}{T_{\text{Inter}}} \cdot N_{\text{Freq}}$
ms = 3.3 s

where:

$T_{\text{basic}\ \text{identify}\ \text{FDD,inter}}$is specified in
8.1.2.3.2 as 300 ms

$T_{\text{Measurement}\ \text{\ Period,\ Inter}}$ is specified in
8.1.2.3.2 as 480 ms

and

$T_{\text{Inter}}$is specified in 8.1.2.3.2 as 6 gaps of length 11 slots
each, 44 ms

NOTE: The delay for interRAT cell detection is equal to 6.24 s.

The event triggered measurement reporting delay:
2\*T~Measurement\ Period,\ GSM~ = 2\* 480ms =960ms.

BSIC verification: T~identify\ abort~5.28 s.

A.8.5A CSG Proximity Indication Testing Case for UTRAN FDD -- FDD Inter frequency
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note : The test case in this section forms the basis for a signalling
test for CSG proximity detection.

### A.8.5A.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify the UE has implemented properly
the feature for indicating that the UE is entering or leaving the
proximity of one or more CSG member cells based on proximity detection
with an autonomous search function as defined by the requirements in
Section 6.7.

The test case consists of three successive segments: Test Preparation,
Negative Test, and Positive Test. The test scenario comprises of three
UTRAN FDD cells on different carriers. Cell 1 represents the serving
cell in the proximity of the CSG cell, Cell 2 the CSG cell and Cell 3
the serving cell not in the proximity of the CSG cell. The description
of the test procedure is shown in Table A.8.5A-1. The general test
parameters and cell specific test parameters are presented in Table
A.8.5A-2 and Table A.8.5A-3 respectively.

### A.8.5A.2 Test Requirements

The UE shall not send an "entering" proximity indication in T2 during
Negative Test.

The UE shall send an "entering" proximity indication in T3 and send a
"leaving" proximity indication in T4 or T5 during Positive Test.

A.8.6 E-UTRAN Measurements
--------------------------

### A.8.6.1 Correct reporting of E-UTRAN FDD neighbours in fading propagation condition in CELL\_DCH

#### A.8.6.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE makes correct
reporting of an event when doing measurements on E-UTRAN FDD cells. The
test will partly verify the requirements in section 8.1.2.6.

The test consists of three successive time periods, with time duration
T1, T2 and T3. The test parameters are given in tables A.8.24, A.8.25
and A.8.26. In the measurement control information it is indicated to
the UE that event-triggered reporting with Events 3B and 3C shall be
used.

#### A.8.6.1.2 Test Requirements

If the UE needs compressed mode to perform E-UTRAN measurements:

The UE shall send one Event 3C triggered measurement report for cell 2,
with a measurement reporting delay less than 2.65 seconds from the
beginning of time period T2.

The UE shall send one Event 3B triggered measurement report for cell 2,
with a measurement reporting delay less than 480 ms from the beginning
of time period T3.

If the UE does not need compressed mode to perform E-UTRAN measurements:

The UE shall send one Event 3C triggered measurement report for cell 2,
with a measurement reporting delay less than 480 ms from the beginning
of time period T2.

The UE shall send one Event 3B triggered measurement report for cell 2,
with a measurement reporting delay less than 480 ms from the beginning
of time period T3.

The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as long as
the reporting criteria are not fulfilled.

The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

NOTE: The actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to 2 x
TTI~UL\ DCCH~ higher than the measurement reporting delays above because
of TTI insertion uncertainty of the measurement report in the UL DCCH.

### A.8.6.2 Correct reporting of E-UTRAN TDD neighbours in fading propagation condition in CELL\_DCH

#### A.8.6.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE makes correct
reporting of an event when doing measurements on E-UTRAN TDD cells. The
test will partly verify the requirements in section 8.1.2.6.

The test consists of three successive time periods, with time duration
T1, T2 and T3. The test parameters are given in tables A.8.27, A.8.28
and A.29. In the measurement control information it is indicated to the
UE that event-triggered reporting with Events 3B and 3C shall be used.

#### A.8.6.2.2 Test Requirements

If the UE needs compressed mode to perform E-UTRAN measurements:

The UE shall send one Event 3C triggered measurement report for cell 2,
with a measurement reporting delay less than 2.65 seconds from the
beginning of time period T2.

The UE shall send one Event 3B triggered measurement report for cell 2,
with a measurement reporting delay less than 480 ms from the beginning
of time period T3.

If the UE does not need compressed mode to perform E-UTRAN measurements:

The UE shall send one Event 3C triggered measurement report for cell 2,
with a measurement reporting delay less than 480 ms from the beginning
of time period T2.

The UE shall send one Event 3B triggered measurement report for cell 2,
with a measurement reporting delay less than 480 ms from the beginning
of time period T3.

The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as long as
the reporting criteria are not fulfilled.

The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

NOTE: The actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to 2 x
TTI~UL\ DCCH~ higher than the measurement reporting delays above because
of TTI insertion uncertainty of the measurement report in the UL DCCH.

### A.8.6.3 Correct reporting of E-UTRAN FDD neighbours in fading propagation condition in CELL\_FACH

#### A.8.6.3.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE makes correct
reporting of an event when doing network configured measurements on
E-UTRAN FDD cells in CELL\_FACH. The test will partly verify the
requirements in section 8.4a.2.6.3.

The test consists of two successive time periods, with time duration T1,
T2. The test parameters are given in tables A.8.29A, A.8.29B and
A.8.29C. In the measurement control information it is indicated to the
UE that event-triggered reporting shall be used. CELL\_FACH with
discontinuous HS-DSCH reception should be configured.

#### A.8.6.3.2 Test Requirements

The measurement delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
period T2 and the moment at which the UE starts to send preambles on the
PRACH to send the MEASUREMENT REPORT message.

The measurement delay shall be less than 5 seconds

NOTE: The measurement delay can be expressed as:
$T_{\text{identify,E-UTRAN}} + T_{\text{RA}}$, where:

T~RA~ is a delay is caused by the physical random access procedure
described in TS 25.214 section 6.1. A persistence value is assumed to be
1 in this test case and therefore T~RA~ in this test case is 40 ms.

T~Identify,,E-UTRAN~ = Time to identify an E-UTRA cell, as defined in
section 8.4a.2.6.1

### A.8.6.4 Correct reporting of E-UTRAN TDD neighbours in fading propagation condition

#### A.8.6.4.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE makes correct
reporting of an event when doing network configured measurements on
E-UTRAN TDD cells in CELL\_FACH. The test will partly verify the
requirements in section 8.4a.2.6.3.

The test consists of two successive time periods, with time duration T1,
T2. The test parameters are given in tables A.8.27, A.8.28 and A.29. In
the measurement control information it is indicated to the UE that
event-triggered reporting shall be used. CELL\_FACH with discontinuous
HS-DSCH reception.

TDD neighbours in fading propagation condition.

#### A.8.6.4.2 Test Requirements

The measurement delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
period T2 and the moment at which the UE starts to send preambles on the
PRACH to send the MEASUREMENT REPORT message.

The measurement delay shall be less than 5 seconds.

NOTE: The measurement delay can be expressed as:
$T_{\text{identify,E-UTRAN}} + T_{\text{RA}}$, where:

T~RA~ is a delay is caused by the physical random access procedure
described in TS 25.214 section 6.1. A persistence value is assumed to be
1 in this test case and therefore T~RA~ in this test case is 40 ms.

T~Identify,,E-UTRAN~ = Time to identify an E-UTRA cell, as defined in
section 8.4a.2.6.1.

### A.8.6.5 Correct reporting of E-UTRAN FDD neighbours in fading propagation condition in CELL\_DCH for Increased Carrier Monitoring with reduced performance group configured

#### A.8.6.5.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE makes correct
reporting of an event when doing measurements on E-UTRAN FDD cells. The
test will partly verify the requirements in section 8.1.2.6.

The test consists of three successive time periods, with time duration
T1, T2 and T3. The test parameters are given in tables A.8.24A, A.8.25A,
A.8.25A and A.8.26AA. In the measurement control information it is
indicated to the UE that event-triggered reporting with Events 3B and 3C
shall be used.

#### A.8.6.5.2 Test Requirements

If the UE needs compressed mode to perform E-UTRAN measurements:

\- The UE shall send one Event 3C triggered measurement report for cell
2, with a measurement reporting delay less than 12.12 seconds from the
beginning of time period T2.

\- The UE shall send one Event 3C triggered measurement report for cell
3, with a measurement reporting delay less than 84.8 seconds from the
beginning of time period T2.

\- The UE shall send one Event 3C triggered measurement report for cell
4, with a measurement reporting delay less than 84.8 seconds from the
beginning of time period T2.

\- The UE shall send one Event 3B triggered measurement report for cell
2, with a measurement reporting delay less than 2.195 s from the
beginning of time period T3.

\- The UE shall send one Event 3B triggered measurement report for cell
3, with a measurement reporting delay less than 15.36 s from the
beginning of time period T3.

\- The UE shall send one Event 3B triggered measurement report for cell
4, with a measurement reporting delay less than 15.36 s from the
beginning of time period T3.

If the UE does not need compressed mode to perform E-UTRAN measurements:

\- The UE shall send one Event 3C triggered measurement report for cell
2, with a measurement reporting delay less than 480 ms from the
beginning of time period T2.

\- The UE shall send one Event 3C triggered measurement report for cell
3, with a measurement reporting delay less than 480 ms from the
beginning of time period T2.

\- The UE shall send one Event 3C triggered measurement report for cell
4, with a measurement reporting delay less than 480 ms from the
beginning of time period T2.

\- The UE shall send one Event 3B triggered measurement report for cell
2, with a measurement reporting delay less than 2.195 s from the
beginning of time period T3.

\- The UE shall send one Event 3B triggered measurement report for cell
3, with a measurement reporting delay less than 15.36 s from the
beginning of time period T3.

\- The UE shall send one Event 3B triggered measurement report for cell
4, with a measurement reporting delay less than 15.36 s from the
beginning of time period T3.

\- The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as long as
the reporting criteria are not fulfilled.

The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

NOTE: The actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to 2 x
TTI~UL\ DCCH~ higher than the measurement reporting delays above because
of TTI insertion uncertainty of the measurement report in the UL DCCH.

### A.8.6.6 Correct reporting of E-UTRAN TDD neighbours in fading propagation condition in CELL\_DCH for Increased Carrier Monitoring with reduced performance group configured

#### A.8.6.6.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE makes correct
reporting of an event when doing measurements on E-UTRAN TDD cells. The
test will partly verify the requirements in section 8.1.2.6.

The test consists of three successive time periods, with time duration
T1, T2 and T3. The test parameters are given in tables A.8.27A, A.8.28A,
A.8.29A and A.8.29AA. In the measurement control information it is
indicated to the UE that event-triggered reporting with Events 3B and 3C
shall be used.

3, with a measurement reporting delay less than 480 ms from the
beginning of time period T2.

\- The UE shall send one Event 3C triggered measurement report for cell
4, with a measurement reporting delay less than 480 ms from the
beginning of time period T2.

\- The UE shall send one Event 3B triggered measurement report for cell
2, with a measurement reporting delay less than 2.195 s from the
beginning of time period T3.

\- The UE shall send one Event 3B triggered measurement report for cell
3, with a measurement reporting delay less than 15.36 s from the
beginning of time period T3.

\- The UE shall send one Event 3B triggered measurement report for cell
4, with a measurement reporting delay less than 15.36 s from the
beginning of time period T3.

\- The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as long as
the reporting criteria are not fulfilled.

The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

NOTE: The actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to 2 x
TTI~UL\ DCCH~ higher than the measurement reporting delays above because
of TTI insertion uncertainty of the measurement report in the UL DCCH.

A.8.7 Combined Interfrequency and E-UTRAN measurements
------------------------------------------------------

### A.8.7.1 Correct reporting of E-UTRA FDD neighbours in fading propagation condition

#### A.8.7.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE makes correct
reporting of an event when doing inter frequency and E-UTRAN FDD
measurements. The test will partly verify the requirements in section
8.1.2.3 and 8.1.2.6. The requirements are also applicable for a UE not
requiring compressed mode for inter-frequency or inter-RAT E-UTRAN FDD
measurements. In case a UE is not requiring compressed mode for
inter-frequency measurements no compressed mode pattern with measurement
purpose \"FDD measurement\" should be sent and in case a UE is not
requiring compressed mode for inter-RAT E-UTRAN measurements no
compressed mode pattern with measurement purpose \"E-UTRAN
measurements\" should be sent for the parameters specified in table
A8.30.

The test consists of two successive time periods, with time durations T1
and T2. The test parameters are given in tables A.8.30, A.8.31 and
A.8.32 below. In the measurement control information it is indicated to
the UE that event-triggered reporting with Event 2B and 3A shall be
used.

#### A.8.7.1.2 Test Requirements

The UE shall send one Event 2B triggered measurement report for Cell2,
with a measurement reporting delay less than 5.14 s from the beginning
of time period T2.

The UE shall send one Event 3A triggered measurement report for Cell3,
with a measurement reporting delay less than 8.23 s from the beginning
of time period T2.

NOTE: The delay for interfrequency cell detection is equal to:

$T_{\text{identify,}\ \text{\ inter}} = T_{\text{basic}\ \text{identify}\ \text{FDD,inter}} \cdot \frac{T_{\text{Measurement}\ \text{\ Period,\ Inter}}}{T_{\text{Inter}}} \cdot N_{\text{Freq}}$
ms = 5143 ms

where:

$T_{\text{basic}\ \text{identify}\ \text{FDD,inter}}$ is specified in
8.1.2.3.2 as 300 ms

$T_{\text{Measurement}\ \text{\ Period,\ Inter}}$ is specified in
8.1.2.3.2 as 480 ms

and

$T_{\text{Inter}}$ is specified in 8.1.2.3.2 as 6 gaps of length 7 slots
each, 28 ms

NOTE: The delay for interRAT cell detection is equal to:

$T_{\text{Identify,E-UTRAN}} = N_{\text{freq},E - \text{UTRA}} \cdot T_{\text{Basic\_Identify\_E-UTRAN\ }} \cdot \frac{\text{480}}{T_{\text{E-UTRAN}}}\ \text{ms}$
= 8229 ms

where:

T~Basic\_Identify\_E-UTRAN~ is specified in 8.1.2.6 as 480 ms

and

T~E-UTRAN~ is specified in 8.1.2.6 as 6 gaps of length 7 slots each, 28
ms

### A.8.7.2 Correct reporting of E-UTRA TDD neighbours in fading propagation condition

#### A.8.7.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE makes correct
reporting of an event when doing inter frequency and E-UTRAN TDD
measurements. The test will partly verify the requirements in section
8.1.2.3 and 8.1.2.6. The requirements are also applicable for a UE not
requiring compressed mode for inter-frequency or inter-RAT E-UTRAN TDD
measurements. In case a UE is not requiring compressed mode for
inter-frequency measurements no compressed mode pattern with measurement
purpose \"FDD measurement\" should be sent and in case a UE is not
requiring compressed mode for inter-RAT E-UTRAN measurements no
compressed mode pattern with measurement purpose \"E-UTRAN
measurements\" should be sent for the parameters specified in table
A8.33.

The test consists of two successive time periods, with time durations T1
and T2. The test parameters are given in tables A.8.33, A.8.34 and
A.8.35 below. In the measurement control information it is indicated to
the UE that event-triggered reporting with Event 2B and 3A shall be
used.

#### A.8.7.2.2 Test Requirements

The UE shall send one Event 2B triggered measurement report for Cell2,
with a measurement reporting delay less than 5.14 s from the beginning
of time period T2.

The UE shall send one Event 3A triggered measurement report for Cell3,
with a measurement reporting delay less than 8.23 s from the beginning
of time period T2.

NOTE: The delay for interfrequency cell detection is equal to:

$T_{\text{identify,}\ \text{\ inter}} = T_{\text{basic}\ \text{identify}\ \text{FDD,inter}} \cdot \frac{T_{\text{Measurement}\ \text{\ Period,\ Inter}}}{T_{\text{Inter}}} \cdot N_{\text{Freq}}$
ms = 5143 ms

where:

$T_{\text{basic}\ \text{identify}\ \text{FDD,inter}}$ is specified in
8.1.2.3.2 as 300 ms

$T_{\text{Measurement}\ \text{\ Period,\ Inter}}$ is specified in
8.1.2.3.2 as 480 ms

and

$T_{\text{Inter}}$ is specified in 8.1.2.3.2 as 6 gaps of length 7 slots
each, 28 ms

NOTE: The delay for interRAT cell detection is equal to:

$T_{\text{Identify,E-UTRAN}} = N_{\text{freq},E - \text{UTRA}} \cdot T_{\text{Basic\_Identify\_E-UTRAN\ }} \cdot \frac{\text{480}}{T_{\text{E-UTRAN}}}\ \text{ms}$
= 8229 ms

where:

T~Basic\_Identify\_E-UTRAN~ is specified in 8.1.2.6 as 480 ms

and

T~E-UTRAN~ is specified in 8.1.2.6 as 6 gaps of length 7 slots each, 28
ms

A.9 Measurement Performance Requirements
========================================

Unless explicitly stated:

\- Reported measurements shall be within defined range in 90 % of the
cases.

\- Measurement channel is 12.2 kbps as defined in TS 25.101 annex A,
sub-clause A.3.1. This measurement channel is used both in active cell
and cells to be measured.

\- Physical channels used as defined in TS 25.101 annex C.

\- Cell 1 is the active cell when in CELL\_DCH state.

\- Single task reporting.

\- Power control is active.

### A.9.1.1 CPICH RSCP

#### A.9.1.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the CPICH RSCP measurement
accuracy is within the specified limits. This test will verify the
requirements in section 9.1.1.

##### A.9.1.1.1.1 Intra frequency test parameters

In this case all cells are on the same frequency. Both CPICH RSCP intra
frequency absolute and relative accuracy requirements are tested by
using test parameters in Table A.9.1.

#### A.9.1.2.2 Test Requirements

The CPICH Ec/Io measurement accuracy shall meet the requirements in
section 9.1.2. In case of the absolute intra -frequency CPICH\_Ec/Io
measurement and relative inter-frequency CPICH\_Ec/Io measurement
accuracy test cases the effect of assumed thermal noise and noise
generated in the receiver (-99 dBm for frequency bands I, IV, VI, X, XI,
XIX and XXI; -98 dBm for frequency band IX, -97dBm for frequency bands
II, V and VII; -95.5dBm for frequency band XXV and XXVI; and -96dBm for
frequency band III) shall be added into the required accuracy. The test
requirements for the absolute intra -frequency CPICH\_Ec/Io measurement
are defined in Section 9.1.2 as shown in Table A.9.4A. The test
requirements for the relative inter-frequency CPICH\_Ec/Io measurement
are defined in Section 9.1.2 as shown in Table A.9.4B.

### A.9.1.3 UTRA Carrier RSSI

#### A.9.1.3.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the UTRA Carrier RSSI
measurement accuracy is within the specified limits. This test will
verify the requirements in section 9.1.3. In this case all cells are in
different frequencies and compressed mode is applied. The gap length is
7, detailed definition is in TS 25.101 annex A.5, Set 1 of Table A.22.
UTRA Carrier RSSI accuracy requirements are tested by using test
parameters in Table A.9.5 for absolute accuracy and Table A.9.5.1 for
relative accuracy. In the relative accuracy test, UTRA carrier RSSI
measurements of neighbour cell 2 and neighbour cell 3 are reported to
serving cell 1.

##### A.9.1.4.1.2 Inter frequency test parameters

During the test the timing difference between Cell 1 and 2 can be set to
value from 0...9830399 chips.

In this test case both cells are in different frequency and compressed
mode is applied. The gap length is 7, detailed definition is in TS
25.101 annex A.5, Set 1 of Table A.22. Table A.9.7 defines the limits of
signal strengths and code powers, where the requirement is applicable.

#### A.9.1.4.2 Test Requirements

The SFN-CFN observed time difference measurement accuracy shall meet the
requirements in section 9.1.7.

### A.9.1.5 SFN-SFN observed time difference

#### A.9.1.5.1 SFN-SFN observed time difference type 1

##### A.9.1.5.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the SFN-SFN observed time
difference type 1 measurement accuracy is within the specified limits.
This test will verify the requirements in section 9.1.8.1.

During the test the timing difference between Cell 1 and 2 can be set to
value from 0...9830399 chips.

In this case all cells are in the same frequency. Table A.9.8 defines
the limits of signal strengths and code powers, where the requirements
are applicable.

##### A.9.1.5.1.2 Test Requirements

The SFN-SFN observed time difference type 1 measurement accuracy shall
meet the requirements in section 9.1.8.1

#### A.9.1.5.2 SFN-SFN observed time difference type 2 without IPDL period active

##### A.9.1.5.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the SFN-SFN observed time
difference type 2 measurement accuracy without IPDL period active is
within the specified limits. This test will verify the requirements in
section 9.1.8.2.

During the test the time difference between Cell 1 and 2 can be set to
value from ‑1279.75 to 1280 chips.

In this case all cells are in the same frequency. Table A.9.9 defines
the limits of signal strengths and code powers, where the requirements
are applicable.

##### A.9.1.5.2.2 Test Requirements

The SFN-SFN observed time difference type 2 measurement accuracy shall
meet the requirements in section 9.1.8.2

#### A.9.1.5.3 SFN-SFN observed time difference type 2 with IPDL period active

##### A.9.1.5.3.1 Test Purpose and Environment

This requirement is valid only for UEs supporting IPDL measurements.

The purpose of this test is to verify that the SFN-SFN observed time
difference type 2 measurement accuracy is within the specified limits.
This test will verify the requirements in section 9.1.8.2.

During the test the time difference between Cell 1 and 2 shall be set
according to the assistance data defined in table A.9.10A.

In this case all cells are in the same frequency. Table A.9.10 defines
the limits of signal strengths and code powers, where the requirements
are applicable.

##### A.9.1.5.3.2 Test Requirements

The SFN-SFN observed time difference type 2 measurement accuracy shall
meet the requirements in section 9.1.8.2

### A.9.1.6 UE Rx-Tx time difference

#### A.9.1.6.1 UE Rx-Tx time difference type 1

##### A.9.1.6.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE Rx-Tx time difference
type 1 measurement accuracy is within the specified limits. This test
will verify the requirements in section 9.1.9.1

The connection is started using cell 1, then cell 2 is added to the
active set so that cell 1 is the timing reference. During the test the
downlink DPCH time difference between Cell 1 and 2 can be set to any
value from ‑148 to 148 chips.

Table A.9.11 defines the limits of signal strengths and code powers,
where the requirements are applicable.

##### A.9.1.6.1.2 Test Requirements

The UE Rx-Tx time difference type 1 measurement accuracy measured for
cell 2 shall meet the requirements in section 9.1.9.1.

#### A.9.1.6.2 UE Rx-Tx time difference type 2

##### A.9.1.6.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE Rx-Tx time difference
type 2 measurement accuracy is within the specified limits. This test
will verify the requirements in section 9.1.9.2.

The connection is started using cell 1, then cell 2 is added to the
active set so that cell 1 is the timing reference.*During the test the
downlink DPCH time difference between Cell 1 and 2 can be set to any
value from ‑148 to 148 chips.*

Table A.9.12 defines the limits of signal strengths and code powers,
where the requirements are applicable.

##### A.9.1.9.1.1 Test Procedure

1\) Set the maximum allowed uplink transmit power (*P*~max~) to the
maximum power for that UE power class.

2\) Use uplink power control commands to set the UE DPCCH power to a
level (*P*) where the UE power headroom is at least 31dB.

3\) Measure the power transmitted by the UE on DPCCH every time slot.
The DPCCH output power shall be averaged over 100 ms.

4\) The total measured output power of the UE shall be averaged over 100
ms.

5\) Estimate the reference UE transmission power headroom as the
difference between the maximum allowed uplink transmit power (*P*~max~)
and the average DPCCH power measured in step 3.

6\) Check the UE reported value of UE transmission power headroom.

7\) Check the accuracy limits according to table 9.34B for the total
output power measured in step 4).

8\) The difference between the reported UPH in step 6) and estimated
reference UPH in step 5) shall be within the accuracy limits obtained in
step 7).

9\) Increase the variable *P* by 1 dB.

10\) Repeat from step 2) until the UPH is tested over the entire dynamic
range.

#### A.9.1.9.2 Test Requirements

The UE transmission power headroom measurement report accuracy shall
meet the requirements in section 9.1.13.4.

The rate of correct measurements observed during repeated tests shall be
at least 90%.

### A.9.1.10 E-UTRAN FDD RSRP absolute accuracy (CELL\_DCH)

#### A.9.1.10.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the E-UTRAN FDD RSRP
measurement absolute accuracy is within the specified limits. This test
will verify the requirements in section 9.1.4a.

The test is carried out in Cell\_DCH state using a compressed mode
pattern with purpose "E-UTRAN Measurement". The compressed mode pattern
repeats every 80 ms and uses a gap length of 10 slots. Further details
are found in TS 25.101 annex A.5.

Tables A.9.1.10.1-1 and A.9.1.10.1-2 define the limits of signal
strengths and code powers on the UTRA FDD cell where the requirement is
applicable. In the measurement control information periodic reporting of
E-UTRAN FDD RSRP is indicated to the UE. The E-UTRAN FDD test parameters
are given in Table A.9.1.10.1-3.

#### A.9.1.10.2 Test Requirements

The E-UTRAN FDD RSRP absolute measurement accuracy shall meet the
requirements in section 9.1.4a.

### A.9.1.11 E-UTRAN TDD RSRP Absolute Accuracy (CELL\_DCH)

#### A.9.1.11.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the E-UTRAN TDD RSRP
measurement absolute accuracy is within the specified limits. This test
will verify the requirements in section 9.1.4a.

The test is carried out in Cell\_DCH state using a compressed mode
pattern with purpose "E-UTRAN Measurement". The compressed mode pattern
repeats every 80 ms and uses a gap length of 10 slots. Further details
are found in table A.22 in annex A.5 of 3GPP TS 25.101.

Tables A.9.1.11.1-1 and A.9.1.11.1-2 define the limits of signal
strengths and code powers on the UTRA FDD cell where the requirement is
applicable. In the measurement control information periodic reporting of
E-UTRAN TDD RSRP is indicated to the UE. The E-UTRAN TDD test parameters
are given in Table A.9.1.11.1-3.

#### A.9.1.11.2 Test Requirements

The E-UTRAN TDD RSRP absolute measurement accuracy shall meet the
requirements in section 9.1.4a.

### A.9.1.12 E-UTRA FDD RSRQ absolute accuracy (CELL\_DCH)

#### A.9.1.12.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the E-UTRAN FDD RSRQ
measurement absolute accuracy is within the specified limits. This test
will verify the requirements in section 9.1.4b.

The test is carried out in Cell\_DCH state using a compressed mode
pattern with purpose "E-UTRAN Measurement". The compressed mode pattern
repeats every 80 ms and uses a gap length of 10 slots. Further details
are found in TS 25.101 annex A.5.

Tables A.9.1.12.1-1 and A.9.1.12.1-2 define the limits of signal
strengths and code powers on the UTRA FDD cell where the requirement is
applicable. In the measurement control information periodic reporting of
E-UTRAN RSRQ is indicated to the UE. The E-UTRAN FDD test parameters are
given in Table A.9.1.12.1-3.

#### A.9.1.12.2 Test Requirements

The E-UTRAN FDD RSRQ absolute measurement accuracy shall meet the
requirements in section 9.1.4b.

### A.9.1.13 E-UTRAN TDD RSRQ Absolute Accuracy (CELL\_DCH)

#### A.9.1.13.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the E-UTRAN TDD RSRQ
measurement absolute accuracy is within the specified limits. This test
will verify the requirements in section 9.1.4b.

The test is carried out in Cell\_DCH state using a compressed mode
pattern with purpose "E-UTRAN Measurement". The compressed mode pattern
repeats every 80 ms and uses a gap length of 10 slots. Further details
are found in table A.22 in annex A.5 of 3GPP TS 25.101.

Tables A.9.1.13.1-1 and A.9.1.13.1-2 define the limits of signal
strengths and code powers on the UTRA FDD cell where the requirement is
applicable. In the measurement control information periodic reporting of
E-UTRAN TDD RSRQ is indicated to the UE. The E-UTRAN TDD test parameters
are given in Table A.9.1.13.1-3.

#### A.9.1.13.2 Test Requirements

The E-UTRAN TDD RSRQ absolute measurement accuracy shall meet the
requirements in section 9.1.4b.

### A.9.1.14 E-UTRAN FDD RSRP Absolute Accuracy for 5 MHz Bandwidth

#### A.9.1.14.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the E-UTRAN FDD RSRP
measurement absolute accuracy is within the specified limits. This test
will verify the requirements in section 9.1.4a.

The test is carried out in Cell\_DCH state using a compressed mode
pattern with purpose "E-UTRAN Measurement". The compressed mode pattern
repeats every 80 ms and uses a gap length of 10 slots. Further details
are found in TS 25.101 annex A.5.

Tables A.9.1.14.1-1 and A.9.1.14.1-2 define the limits of signal
strengths and code powers on the UTRA FDD cell where the requirement is
applicable. In the measurement control information periodic reporting of
E-UTRAN FDD RSRP is indicated to the UE. The E-UTRAN FDD test parameters
are given in Table A.9.1.14.1-3.

#### A.9.1.14.2 Test Requirements

The E-UTRAN FDD RSRP absolute measurement accuracy shall meet the
requirements in section 9.1.4a.

### A.9.1.15 E-UTRA FDD RSRQ Absolute Accuracy for 5 MHz Bandwidth

#### A.9.1.15.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the E-UTRAN FDD RSRQ
measurement absolute accuracy is within the specified limits. This test
will verify the requirements in section 9.1.4b.

The test is carried out in Cell\_DCH state using a compressed mode
pattern with purpose "E-UTRAN Measurement". The compressed mode pattern
repeats every 80 ms and uses a gap length of 10 slots. Further details
are found in TS 25.101 annex A.5.

Tables A.9.1.15.1-1 and A.9.1.15.1-2 define the limits of signal
strengths and code powers on the UTRA FDD cell where the requirement is
applicable. In the measurement control information periodic reporting of
E-UTRAN RSRQ is indicated to the UE. The E-UTRAN FDD test parameters are
given in Table A.9.1.15.1-3.

#### A.9.1.15.2 Test Requirements

The E-UTRAN FDD RSRQ absolute measurement accuracy shall meet the
requirements in section 9.1.4b.

### A.9.1.16 E-UTRAN FDD RSRP absolute accuracy (CELL\_FACH)

#### A.9.1.16.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the E-UTRAN FDD RSRP
measurement absolute accuracy is within the specified limits. This test
will verify the requirements in section 9.1.4a.

The test is carried out in Cell\_FACH state using HS-DSCH DRX.

Tables A.9.1.16.1-1 and A.9.1.16.1-2 define the limits of signal
strengths and code powers on the UTRA FDD cell where the requirement is
applicable. In the measurement control information periodic reporting of
E-UTRAN FDD RSRP is indicated to the UE. The E-UTRAN FDD test parameters
are given in Table A.9.1.16.1-3.

#### A.9.1.19.2 Test Requirements

The E-UTRAN TDD RSRQ absolute measurement accuracy shall meet the
requirements in section 9.1.4b.

### A.9.1.20 E-UTRA FDD WB-RSRQ Absolute Accuracy (CELL\_DCH)

#### A.9.1.20.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the E-UTRAN FDD WB-RSRQ
measurement absolute accuracy is within the specified limits. This test
will verify the requirements in section 9.1.4c.

The test is carried out in Cell\_DCH state using a compressed mode
pattern with purpose "E-UTRAN Measurement". The compressed mode pattern
repeats every 80 ms and uses a gap length of 10 slots. Further details
are found in annex A.5 of TS 25.101 \[3\].

Tables A.9.1.20.1-1 and A.9.1.20.1-2 define the limits of signal
strengths and code powers on the UTRA FDD cell where the requirement is
applicable. In the measurement control information periodic reporting of
E-UTRAN WB-RSRQ is indicated to the UE. The measurement control message
received by the UE shall also contain the IE "*Wideband RSRQ
measurements*" and "*Measurement Bandwidth*" defined in TS 25.331
\[16\].

The E-UTRAN FDD test parameters are given in Table A.9.1.20.1-3.

#### A.9.1.20.2 Test Requirements

The E-UTRAN FDD WB-RSRQ measurement accuracy for cell 2 shall fulfil the
requirements in Section 9.1.4c, compared with WB-RSRQ~0~ or WB-RSRQ~1~.

### A.9.1.21 E-UTRA TDD WB-RSRQ Absolute Accuracy (CELL\_DCH)

#### A.9.1.21.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the E-UTRAN TDD WB-RSRQ
measurement absolute accuracy is within the specified limits. This test
will verify the requirements in section 9.1.4c.

The test is carried out in Cell\_DCH state using a compressed mode
pattern with purpose "E-UTRAN Measurement". The compressed mode pattern
repeats every 80 ms and uses a gap length of 10 slots. Further details
are found in annex A.5 of TS 25.101 \[3\].

Tables A.9.1.21.1-1 and A.9.1.21.1-2 define the limits of signal
strengths and code powers on the UTRA FDD cell where the requirement is
applicable. In the measurement control information periodic reporting of
E-UTRAN WB-RSRQ is indicated to the UE. The measurement control message
received by the UE shall also contain the IE "*Wideband RSRQ
measurements*" and "*Measurement Bandwidth*" defined in TS 25.331
\[16\].

The E-UTRAN TDD test parameters are given in Table A.9.1.21.1-3.
