4 General aspects
=================

The specification of Iub DCH and E-DCH data streams is also valid for
Iur DCH and E-DCH data streams.

The complete configuration of the transport channel is selected by the
SRNC and signalled to the Node B via the Iub and Iur control plane
protocols.

The parameters of a transport channel are described in TS 25.301 \[1\].
Transport channels are multiplexed on the downlink by the Node B on
radio physical channels, and de-multiplexed on the uplink from radio
physical channels to transport channels.

In Iur interface, every set of coordinated transport channels related to
one UE context that is communicated over a set of cells that are
macro-diversity combined within Node B or DRNC, is carried on one
transport bearer. This means that there are as many transport bearers as
set of coordinated transport channels and Iur DCH data ports for that
communication.

In Iub interface, every set of coordinated transport channels related to
one UE context that is communicated over a set of cells that are
macro-diversity combined within Node B is carried on one transport
bearer. This means that there are as many transport bearers as set of
coordinated transport channels and Iub DCH data ports for that
communication.

Bi-directional transport bearers are used.

4.1 DCH and E-DCH FP services
-----------------------------

DCH frame protocol provides the following services:

\- Transport of TBS across Iub and Iur interface.

\- Transport of outer loop power control information between the SRNC
and the Node B.

\- Support of transport channel synchronisation mechanism.

\- Support of node synchronization mechanism.

\- \[3.84 Mcps TDD and 7.68 Mcps - Transfer of Rx timing deviation from
the Node B to the SRNC.\]

\- Transfer of radio interface parameters from the SRNC to the Node B.

\[FDD -- E-DCH frame protocol provides the following services:

\- Transport of MAC-es or MAC-is PDUs across Iub and Iur interface from
Node B to SRNC.

\- Transport of outer loop power control information between the SRNC
and the Node B.

\- Transfer of radio interface parameters from the SRNC to the Node B.

\- Transport of network congestion indication from SRNC across Iub and
Iur interface.

\- Transport of hybrid ARQ information between SRNC and Node B.\]

\[TDD -- E-DCH frame protocol provides the following services:

\- Transport of MAC-es or MAC-is PDUs across Iub and Iur interface from
Node B to SRNC.

\- Transport of outer loop power control information between the SRNC
and the Node B.

\- Transport of network congestion indication from SRNC across Iub and
Iur interface.

\- Transport of hybrid ARQ information between SRNC and Node B.\]

4.2 Services expected from the Data Transport Network layer
-----------------------------------------------------------

Following service is required from the transport layer:

\- Delivery of FP PDU.

In sequence delivery is not required. However, frequent out-of-sequence
delivery may impact the performance and should be avoided.

4.3 Protocol Version
--------------------

This revision of the specification specifies version 1 of the protocol.

5 DCH Frame Protocol procedures
===============================

5.1 Data Transfer
-----------------

### 5.1.0 General

When there is some data to be transmitted, DCH data frames are
transferred every transmission time interval from the SRNC to the Node B
for downlink transfer, and DCH/E-DCH data frames are transferred every
transmission time interval from Node B to the SRNC for uplink transfer.
\[FDD -- For 2 ms Uu TTI and depending on configuration from higher
layers, the uplink E-DCH MAC-es or MAC-is PDU's from one or more 2ms Uu
TTI's may be bundled into one E-DCH Data Frame before being transferred
at an interval of e.g. 10ms from the Node B to the SRNC.\]

An optional error detection mechanism may be used to protect the data
transfer if needed. At the transport channel setup it shall be specified
if the error detection on the user data is used.

### 5.1.1 Uplink for DCH

Figure 1: Uplink Data Transfer procedure

Two modes can be used for the UL transmission: *normal mode* and *silent
mode*. The mode is selected by the SRNC when the transport bearer is
setup and signalled to the Node B with the relevant control plane
procedure.

\- In normal mode, the Node B shall always send an UL DATA FRAME to the
RNC for all the DCHs in a set of coordinated DCHs regardless of the
number of Transport Blocks of the DCHs.

\- In silent mode and in case only one transport channel is transported
on a transport bearer, the Node B shall not send an UL DATA FRAME to the
RNC when it has received a TFI indicating \"number of TB equal to 0\"
for the transport channel during a TTI.

\- In silent mode and in case of coordinated DCHs, when the Node B
receives a TFI indicating \"number of TB equal to 0\" for all the DCHs
in a set of coordinated DCHs, the Node B shall not send an UL DATA FRAME
to the RNC for this set of coordinated DCHs.

For any TTI in which the Node B Layer 1 generated at least one
CPHY-Out-of-Sync-IND primitive, the Node B is not required to send an UL
DATA FRAME to the SRNC.

When Node B receives an invalid TFCI, no UL DATA FRAME shall be sent to
the SRNC.

### 5.1.1a Uplink for E-DCH

Figure 1a: Uplink Data Transfer procedure

When a MAC-e or MAC-i PDU is received, it is demultiplexed into MAC-d
flows which are then each sent on separate transport bearers to the RNC
using the E-DCH UL DATA FRAME TYPE 1 (MAC-e) or TYPE 2 (MAC-i).

Only silent mode is used, i.e. E-DCH user-plane payload is transmitted
using the E-DCH UL DATA FRAME only when some payload has been
successfully received.

\[FDD -- In case of Multi Cell E-DCH operation two transport bearer
modes can be used for the E-DCH payload transmission: *separate Iub
transport bearer mode* and *E-DCH UL flow multiplexing mode*. The mode
is selected by the SRNC when the RL on secondary UL frequency is setup
and signalled to the Node B with the relevant control plane procedure.

-   In separate Iub transport bearer mode, the Node B shall send each
    MAC-d flow received in cells of the different UL frequencies
    (primary and secondary) on separate transport bearers, one per
    frequency, to the RNC using the E-DCH UL DATA FRAME TYPE 2 (MAC-i).

-   In E-DCH UL flow multiplexing mode, the Node B shall send the MAC-d
    flows received on all UL frequencies (primary as well as secondary)
    on one transport bearer to the RNC using the E-DCH UL DATA FRAME
    TYPE 2 (MAC-i).\]

\[1.28Mcps TDD -- In case of multiple carriers E-DCH operation two
transport bearer modes can be used for the E-DCH payload transmission:
*separate Iub transport bearer mode* and *E-DCH UL flow multiplexing
mode*. The mode is selected by the SRNC when the RL is setup and
signalled to the Node B with the relevant control plane procedure.

-   In separate Iub transport bearer mode, the Node B shall send each
    MAC-d flow received in the different frequencies on separate
    transport bearers, one per frequency, to the RNC using the E-DCH UL
    DATA FRAME TYPE 2 (MAC-i).

-   In E-DCH UL flow multiplexing mode, the Node B shall send one MAC-d
    flow received on all frequencies on one transport bearer to the RNC
    using the E-DCH UL DATA FRAME TYPE 2 (MAC-i).\]

### 5.1.2 Downlink

Figure 2: Downlink Data Transfer procedure

The Node B shall only consider a transport bearer synchronised after it
has received at least one DL DATA FRAME on this transport bearer before
LTOA (TS 25.402 \[5\]).

The Node B shall consider the DL user plane of a certain RL synchronised
once all transport bearers established to carry DCH DL DATA FRAMEs
included in the CCTrCH for this RL are considered as synchronised. Once
synchronised, the Node B shall assume the DL user plane for this Radio
Link stays synchronised as long as the Radio Link exists, even if
transport bearers are added (see 5.10.2), replaced (see subclause
5.10.1), or removed. When a RL established through the Radio Link
Addition procedure (TS 25.433 \[4\] TS 25.423 \[6\]) is combined with a
RL whose DL user plane is considered as synchronised, the Node B shall
consider the DL user plane of this newly established RL as synchronised.

\[FDD - The Node B shall transmit on the DL DPDCH(s) of a certain RL
only when the DL user plane of this RL is considered synchronised.\]

\[TDD -- The Node B shall transmit special bursts on the DL DPCH as per
TS 25.224 \[11\], until the DL user plane is considered synchronised\].

When the DL user plane is considered synchronised and the Node B does
not receive a valid DL DATA FRAME in a TTI, it assumes that there is no
data to be transmitted in that TTI for this transport channel, and shall
act as one of the following cases:

> \- \[TDD -- If the Node B receives no valid DL DATA FRAMEs for any
> transport channel assigned to a UE it shall assume DTX and transmit
> special bursts as per TS 25.224 \[11\]\].

\- If the Node B is aware of a TFI value corresponding to zero bits for
this transport channel, this TFI is assumed. If the TFS contains both a
TFI corresponding to \"TB length equal to 0 bits\" and a TFI
corresponding to \"number of TB equal to 0\", the Node B shall assume
the TFI corresponding to \"number of TB equal to 0\". When combining the
TFI\'s of the different transport channels, a valid TFCI might result
and in this case data shall be transmitted on Uu.

\- If the Node B is not aware of a TFI value corresponding to zero bits
for this transport channel or if combining the TFI corresponding to zero
bits with other TFI\'s, results in an unknown TFI combination, the
handling as described in the following paragraph shall be applied.

At each radio frame, the Node B shall build the TFCI value of each
CCTrCH, according to the TFI of the DCH data frames multiplexed on this
CCTrCH and scheduled for that frame. \[FDD - In case the Node B receives
an unknown combination of TFIs from the DL DATA FRAMEs, it shall
transmit only the DPCCH without TFCI bits.\] \[TDD - In case the Node B
receives an unknown combination of DCH DL DATA FRAMEs, it shall apply
DTX, i.e. suspend transmission on the corresponding DPCHs.\]

5.2 Timing Adjustment
---------------------

The Timing Adjustment procedure is used to keep the synchronization of
the DCH data stream in DL direction, i.e to ensure that the Node B
receives the DL frames in an appropriate time for the transmission of
the data in the air interface.

SRNC always includes the Connection Frame Number (CFN) to all DCH DL
DATA FRAMEs.

If a DL DATA FRAME arrives outside the arrival window defined in the
Node B, the Node B shall send a TIMING ADJUSTMENT control frame,
containing the measured ToA and the CFN value of the received DL DATA
FRAME.

Figure 3: Timing Adjustment procedure

The arrival window and the time of arrival are defined as follows:

**Time of Arrival Window Endpoint (ToAWE):** ToAWE represents the time
point by which the DL data shall arrive to the Node B from Iub. The
ToAWE is defined as the amount of milliseconds before the last time
point from which a timely DL transmission for the identified CFN would
still be possible taking into account the Node B internal delays. ToAWE
is set via control plane. If data does not arrive before ToAWE a TIMING
ADJUSTMENT control frame shall be sent by Node B.

**Time of Arrival Window Startpoint (ToAWS):** ToAWS represents the time
after which the DL data shall arrive to the Node B from Iub. The ToAWS
is defined as the amount of milliseconds from the ToAWE. ToAWS is set
via control plane. If data arrives before ToAWS a TIMING ADJUSTMENT
control frame shall be sent by Node B.

**Time of Arrival (ToA):** ToA is the time difference between the end
point of the DL arrival window (ToAWE) and the actual arrival time of DL
frame for a specific CFN. A positive ToA means that the frame is
received before the ToAWE, a negative ToA means that the frame is
received after the ToAWE.

The general overview on the Timing Adjustment procedure is reported in
TS 25.401 \[2\].

5.3 DCH Synchronisation
-----------------------

DCH Synchronisation procedure is used to achieve or restore the
synchronisation of the DCH data stream in DL direction, and as a keep
alive procedure in order to maintain activity on the Iur/Iub transport
bearer.

The procedure is initiated by the SRNC by sending a DL SYNCHRONISATION
control frame towards Node B. This control frame indicates the target
CFN.

Upon reception of the DL SYNCHRONISATION control frame, Node B shall
immediately respond with UL SYNCHRONISATION control frame indicating the
ToA for the DL SYNCHRONISATION control frame and the CFN indicated in
the received DL SYNCHRONISATION control frame.

UL SYNCHRONISATION control frame shall always be sent, even if the DL
SYNCHRONISATION control frame is received by the Node B within the
arrival window.

Figure 4: DCH Synchronisation procedure

5.4 Outer Loop PC Information Transfer \[FDD, 1.28 Mcps TDD\]
-------------------------------------------------------------

Based, for example, on the CRCI values and on the quality estimate in
the UL DATA FRAME, SRNC modifies the SIR target used by the UL inner
loop power control by including the absolute value of the new SIR target
in the OUTER LOOP PC control frame sent to the Node B\'s.

At the reception of the OUTER LOOP PC control frame, the Node B shall
immediately update the SIR target used for the inner loop power control
\[1.28 Mcps TDD - of the respective CCTrCH for UL DCHs\] with the
specified value.

The OUTER LOOP PC control frame can be sent via any of the transport
bearers dedicated to one UE. \[1.28 Mcps TDD - In case of multiple
CCTrCHs carrying DCHs, the OUTER LOOP PC control frame can be sent via
any of the transport bearers carrying DCHs which belong to the CCTrCH
for which the UL SIR target shall be adjusted.\]

Figure 5: Outer Loop Power Control Information Transfer procedure

5.5 Node Synchronisation
------------------------

The Node Synchronisation procedure is used by the SRNC to acquire
information on the Node B timing.

The procedure is initiated by the SRNC by sending a DL NODE
SYNCHRONISATION control frame to Node B containing the parameter T1.

Upon reception of a DL NODE SYNCHRONISATION control frame, the Node B
shall respond with UL NODE SYNCHRONISATION control frame, including the
parameters T2 and T3, as well as the T1 which was indicated in the
initiating DL NODE SYNCHRONISATION control frame.

The T1, T2, T3 parameters are defined as:

T1: RNC specific frame number (RFN) that indicates the time when RNC
sends the DL NODE SYNCHRONISATION control frame through the SAP to the
transport layer.

T2: Node B specific frame number (BFN) that indicates the time when Node
B receives the correspondent DL NODE SYNCHRONIZATION control frame
through the SAP from the transport layer.

T3: Node B specific frame number (BFN) that indicates the time when Node
B sends the UL NODE SYNCHRONISATION control frame through the SAP to the
transport layer.

The general overview on the Node Synchronisation procedure is reported
in TS 25.401 \[2\].

Figure 6: Node Synchronisation procedure

5.6 Rx Timing Deviation Measurement \[3.84 Mcps and 7.68 Mcps TDD\]
-------------------------------------------------------------------

In case the *Timing Advance Applied* IE indicates \"Yes\" (see TS 25.433
\[4\]) in a cell, the Node B shall, for all UEs using DCHs/E-DCHs,
monitor the receiving time of the uplink DPCH/E-PUCH bursts arriving
over the radio interface, and shall calculate the Rx timing deviation.
Additionally, the Rx timing deviation shall be calculated when an
E-RUCCH or a TA Request (TS 25.319 \[13\]) transmission is received. If
the calculated value, after rounding, is not zero, it shall be reported
to the SRNC in a RX TIMING DEVIATION control frame belonging to that UE.
For limitation of the frequency of this reporting, the Node B shall not
send more than one RX TIMING DEVIATION control frame per UE within one
radio frame. The RX TIMING DEVIATION control frame indicates whether the
deviation is derived from a conventional E-RUCCH or a TA Request
reception.

If the *Timing Advance Applied* IE indicates \"No\" (see TS 25.433
\[4\]) in a cell, monitoring of the receiving time of the uplink DPCH
bursts is not necessary and no RX TIMING DEVIATION control frame shall
be sent.

Figure 7: Rx Timing Deviation Measurement procedure

5.7 DSCH TFCI Signalling \[FDD\]
--------------------------------

Void.

5.8 Radio Interface Parameter Update \[FDD\]
--------------------------------------------

This procedure is used to update radio interface parameters which are
applicable to all RL\'s, or E-DCH Serving Radio Link Set, for the
concerning UE. Both synchronised and unsynchronised parameter updates
are supported.

The procedure consists of a RADIO INTERFACE PARAMETER UPDATE control
frame sent by the SRNC to the Node B.

Figure 9: Radio Interface Parameter Update procedure

If the RADIO INTERFACE PARAMETER UPDATE control frame contains a valid
TPC power offset value, the Node B shall apply the newly provided TPC PO
in DL.

If the RADIO INTERFACE PARAMETER UPDATE control frame contains a valid
Maximum UE TX Power value, the E-DCH serving Node B may use the provided
value to improve E-DCH scheduling.

If the frame contains a valid DPC mode value, the Node B shall apply the
newly provided value in DL power control.

The new values shall be applied as soon as possible in case no valid CFN
is included or from the indicated CFN. If the frame contains a valid
Multiple RL Sets Indicator value, the Node B may use the newly provided
value in Multiple RL Sets Indicator whenever the Node B loses UL
synchronization on a RL Set after initial UL synchronization as
described in TS 25.214 \[12\].

If the frame contains a valid Multiple RL Sets Indicator on the
secondary uplink frequency value, the Node B may use the newly provided
value in Multiple RL Sets Indicator on the secondary uplink frequency
whenever the Node B loses UL synchronization on a RL Set after initial
UL synchronization on the secondary uplink frequency as described in TS
25.214 \[12\].

5.9 Timing Advance \[3.84 Mcps and 7.68 Mcps TDD\]
--------------------------------------------------

This procedure is used in order to signal to the Node B the adjustment
to be performed by the UE in the uplink timing.

The Node B shall use the CFN and timing adjustment values to adjust its
layer 1 to allow for accurate impulse averaging.

Figure 9A: Timing Advance procedure

5.10 General
------------

### 5.10.1 Transport bearer replacement

As described in NBAP (TS 25.433 \[4\]) and RNSAP (TS 25.423 \[6\]),
transport bearer replacement can be achieved by using the Synchronised
Radio Link Reconfiguration Preparation procedure in combination with the
Synchronised Radio Link Reconfiguration Commit procedure, or by using
the Unsynchronised Radio Link Reconfiguration procedure. In both cases
the following steps can be discerned:

1\) The new transport bearer is established after which 2 transport
bearers exist in parallel.

2\) The transport channel(s) is/are switched to the new transport
bearer.

3\) The old transport bearer is released.

In step 1), communication on the old transport bearer continues as
normal. In addition, the Node B shall support DL DATA FRAMEs, the DCH
Synchronisation procedure (see section 5.3) and the Timing Adjustment
procedure (see section 5.2) on the new bearer. This enables the SRNC to
determine the timing on the new transport bearer. DL DATA FRAMEs
transported on the new transport bearer shall not be transmitted on the
DL DPDCH before the CFN indicated in the RADIO LINK RECONFIGURATION
COMMIT message.

Regarding step 2), the moment of switching is determined differently in
the synchronised and unsynchronised case:

-   When using the combination of the Synchronised Radio Link
    Reconfiguration Preparation procedure and the Synchronised Radio
    Link Reconfiguration Commit procedure, the UL/DL DATA FRAMEs shall
    be transported on the new transport bearer from the CFN indicated in
    the RADIO LINK RECONFIGURATION COMMIT message \[FDD - or in the case
    the the *Fast Reconfiguration* IE is included in the RADIO LINK
    RECONFIGURATION COMMIT message the Node B shall start using the new
    transport bearer for the transport of UL DATA FRAMEs from the CFN at
    which the NodeB detects that the UE uses the new configuration in
    the uplink\].

-   When using the Unsynchronised Radio Link Reconfiguration procedure,
    the Node B shall start using the new transport bearer for the
    transport of UL DATA FRAMEs from the CFN at which the new transport
    bearer is considered synchronised (i.e. has received a DL DATA FRAME
    before LTOA (TS 25.433 \[4\])). Not applicable for E-DCH. Change is
    done directly in case of an E-DCH.

In both cases, starting from this CFN the Node-B shall support all
applicable DCH/E-DCH Frame Protocol procedures on the new transport
bearer and no requirements exist regarding support of DCH/E-DCH Frame
Protocol procedures on the old transport bearer.

Finally in step 3), the old transport bearer is released.

### 5.10.2 Transport channel addition

As described in NBAP (TS 25.433 \[4\]) and RNSAP (TS 25.423 \[6\]),
transport channel addition can be achieved by using the Synchronised
Radio Link Reconfiguration Preparation procedure in combination with the
Synchronised Radio Link Reconfiguration Commit procedure, or by using
the Unsynchronised Radio Link Reconfiguration procedure.

When using the Synchronised Radio Link Reconfiguration Preparation
procedure the Node B shall support DL DATA FRAMEs, the Synchronisation
procedure (see section 5.3) and the Timing Adjustment procedure (see
section 5.2) on the new transport bearer also before the CFN indicated
in the RADIO LINK RECONFIGURATION COMMIT message, in order to enable the
SRNC to determine the timing on the new transport bearer. DL DATA FRAMEs
transported on the new transport bearer before this CFN shall not be
transmitted on the DL DPDCH. Starting from this CFN the Node B shall
support all applicable DCH and E-DCH frame protocol procedures on the
new transport bearer.

When using the Unsynchronised Radio Link Reconfiguration procedure the
Node B shall support data frames and control frames when the new
transport bearer is established.

5.11 Generation of subframe number 
----------------------------------

The *CFN* and *Subframe Number* IE's values in the E-DCH Data Frame
shall reflect the CFN and subframe number when the payload in the E-DCH
Data Frame was correctly received on the Uu. This corresponds to when
the HARQ process correctly decoded the data. \[FDD - The subframe number
is for 2 ms TTI set to values {0-4} and for 10 ms TTI set to {0}\].
\[3.84Mcps TDD, 7.68 Mcps TDD - the subframe number is set to
{0}\].\[1.28 Mcps TDD - the subframe number is set to {0-1}\].

5.12 Generation of number of HARQ retransmissions
-------------------------------------------------

After successful decoding of E-DCH payload received over Uu, the Node B
shall insert the following values in the *Number of HARQ
Retransmissions* IE:

\- If the RSN value in the last HARQ retransmission that resulted in
successful decoding has the value 0, 1 \[FDD -or 2\], then the Node B
shall insert the same value in the *Number Of HARQ Retransmissions* IE
in the E-DCH Data Frame.

\- If the RSN value in the last HARQ retransmission that resulted in
successful decoding has the value \[TDD -2 or\] 3, then the Node B shall
insert the calculated value of the actual number of retransmissions used
for the successful decoding into the *Number of HARQ Retransmissions* IE
in the E-DCH Data Frame. If the actual number of retransmission cannot
be calculated, then the Node B shall insert the value 15 in the *Number
of HARQ Retransmissions* IE, indicating that the number of HARQ
retransmissions is unknown.

\- If the UE was power limited at the time the subframe was received, or
another condition applies in which the number of retransmissions should
not influence the SIR target level, then the Node B shall insert value
13 into the *Number of HARQ Retransmissions* IE, indicating that the
*Number of HARQ Retransmissions* IE is inappropriate as input to the
outer loop power control.

After unsuccessful decoding of the E-DCH payload, the serving Node B
shall act according to section 5.13, Indication of HARQ failure.

5.13 Indication of HARQ failure
-------------------------------

After unsuccessful decoding of the E-DCH payload and under conditions
listed below, the serving Node B shall send a HARQ Failure Indication to
the SRNC. \[FDD - The non-serving Node B(s) shall not send a HARQ
Failure Indication.\]

The serving Node B shall send a HARQ Failure Indication to the SRNC
under any of the following conditions:

\- A MAC-e or MAC-i PDU for a HARQ process has not yet been successfully
decoded and the RSN \[TDD -and HARQ process ID\] indicates the
transmission of a new MAC-e or MAC-i PDU for the same HARQ process and
the number of HARQ retransmissions that had already occurred was equal
or higher than the lowest of the maximum HARQ retransmissions values for
the UE's configured MAC-d flows.

\- A MAC-e or MAC-i PDU for a HARQ process has not yet been successfully
decoded and the maximum retransmissions for the MAC-d flow with the
highest maximum HARQ retransmissions value valid for the UE connection
have occurred, or should have occurred in case the HARQ related outband
signalling (RSN) on the \[FDD - E-DPCCH\] \[TDD - E-UCCH\] could not be
decoded.

\- A MAC-e or MAC-i PDU for a HARQ process has not yet been successfully
decoded when the MAC-e or MAC-i Reset is performed in UE. The Node B
knows the timing of the MAC-e or MAC-i Reset in the UE via higher layer.

The HARQ Failure Indication shall be sent on only one transport bearer.
The Node B may select any of the transport bearers associated with the
UE for which the HARQ failure relates to.

\[FDD -- In case of Multi Cell E-DCH operation:

\- In E-DCH UL flow multiplexing mode, the NodeB may select any of the
transport bearers associated with the UE for which the HARQ failure
relates to, and including UL Mux Info (UL Multiplexing Information) into
data frame to indicate on which frequency the HARQ failure happens -
**primary UL frequency or secondary UL frequency.**

\- In separate Iub transport bearer mode, the NodeB may select any of
the transport bearers associated with the frequency of the UE for which
the HARQ failure relates to\].

The HARQ failure is indicated in a user data frame with values set as
follows:

\- The *CFN* and *Subframe Number* IE values shall reflect the time when
the failure was detected

\- TYPE 1: The *Number of MAC-es PDUs* IE shall be set to zero. As a
consequence there are no *DDI* and *N* IEs in the header and 4 bits
padding is used after *Number of MAC-es PDUs* IE in order to have the
octet aligned structure, and there are no *MAC-es PDUs* IEs in the
payload part of the data frame related to the HARQ failure.

\- TYPE 2: The *Number of MAC-is PDUs* IE shall be set to zero. As a
consequence there are no *MAC-is PDU descriptor* IE and there are no
*MAC-is PDUs* IEs in the payload part of the data frame related to the
HARQ failure.

\- The *Number of HARQ Retransmissions* IE shall be set to the number of
HARQ retransmissions that occurred when the failure was detected. The
coding shall be the same as for a correctly decoded payload as described
in section 5.12.

\- \[FDD - In case of Multi Cell E-DCH operation, the *UL Mux Info* IE
shall **indicate the frequency in which** the failure was detected **-
primary UL frequency or secondary UL frequency** as described in
subclause [6.2.4.21 in E-DCH UL flow multiplexing mode of Multi Cell
E-DCH operation](#_6.3.3.1.4_Spare_Extension).\]

5.14 TNL Congestion Indication 
------------------------------

This procedure is used by the SRNC to signal, on a transport bearer
carrying an E-DCH MAC-d flow, that a transport network congestion
situation on Iub/Iur has been detected.

Figure 9AB: TNL Congestion Indication procedure

At the reception of the TNL CONGESTION INDICATION control frame, the
Node B should reduce the bit rate on the Iub interface.

If the TNL CONGESTION INDICATION control frame is indicating "TNL
Congestion -- detected by frame loss", or the TNL CONGESTION INDICATION
control frame is indicating "TNL Congestion -- detected by delay
build-up", the Node B should reduce the bit rate for at least the MAC-d
flow on which the congestion indication control frame was received.

If the TNL CONGESTION INDICATION control frame is indicating "No TNL
Congestion", the Node B can gradually go back to normal operation.

6 Frame structure and coding
============================

6.1 General
-----------

The general structure of a DCH FP frame consists of a header and a
payload. The structure is depicted in figure 9B.

Figure 9B: General structure of a frame protocol PDU

The header contains a CRC checksum, the frame type field and information
related to the frame type.

There are two types of DCH FP frames (indicated by the *FT* IE):

\- DCH data frame.

-   DCH control frame.

For the UL direction there is also an E-DCH data frame (indicated by
signalling). The E-DCH data frame is defined with two structures, TYPE 1
and TYPE 2 depending of if it contains MAC-es PDUs (TYPE 1) or MAC-is
PDUs (TYPE 2).

\- E-DCH data frame.

The payload of the data frames contains radio interface user data,
quality information for the transport blocks and for the radio interface
physical channel during the transmission time interval (for UL only),
and an optional CRC field.

The payload of the control frames contains commands and measurement
reports related to transport bearer and the radio interface physical
channel but not directly related to specific radio interface user data.

### 6.1.1 General principles for the coding

In the present document the structure of frames will be specified by
using pictures similar to figure 10.

  -- -- -- ----------------- --------- -------- -------- --- --- --- --- ----------- --

Figure 10: Example of notation used for the definition of the frame
structure

Unless otherwise indicated, fields which consist of multiple bits within
a byte will have the more significant bit located at the higher bit
position (indicated above frame in figure 10). In addition, if a field
spans several bytes, more significant bits will be located in lower
numbered bytes (right of frame in figure 10).

On the Iub/Iur interface, the frame will be transmitted starting from
the lowest numbered byte. Within each byte, the bits are sent according
decreasing bit position (bit position 7 first).

The parameters are specified giving the value range and the step (if not
1). The coding is done as follows (unless otherwise specified):

\- Unsigned values are binary coded.

\- Signed values are coded with the 2\'s complement notation.

Bits labelled \"Spare\" shall be set to zero by the transmitter and
shall be ignored by the receiver. The *Spare Extension* IE indicates the
location where new IEs can in the future be added in a backward
compatible way. The *Spare Extension* IE shall not be used by the
transmitter and shall be ignored by the receiver.

6.2 Data frames
---------------

### 6.2.1 Introduction

The purpose of the user data frames is to transparently transport the
transport blocks between Node B and SRNC.

The protocol allows for multiplexing of coordinated dedicated transport
channels, with the same transmission time interval, onto one transport
bearer.

The transport blocks of all the coordinated DCHs for one transmission
time interval are included in one frame.

SRNC indicates the multiplexing of coordinated dedicated transport
channels in the appropriate RNSAP/NBAP message.

### 6.2.2 UL DATA FRAME

#### 6.2.2.1 UL DATA FRAME FOR DCH

The structure of the UL DATA FRAME is shown in figure 11.

Figure 11: UL DATA FRAME structure

For the description of the fields see subclause 6.2.4.

There are as many TFI fields as number of DCH multiplexed in the same
transport bearer.

The DCHs in the frame structure are ordered from the lower DCH id
(\'first DCH\') to the higher DCH id (\'last DCH\').

The size and the number of TBs for each DCH are defined by the
correspondent TFI.

If the TB does not fill an integer number of bytes, then bit padding is
used as shown in the figure in order to have the octet aligned structure
(ex: a TB of 21 bits requires 3 bits of padding).

There is a CRCI for each TB included in the frame irrespective of the
size of the TB, i.e. the CRCI is included also when the TB length is
zero. If the CRCIs of one data frame do not fill an integer number of
bytes, then bit padding is used as shown in the figure in order to have
the octet aligned structure (ex. 3 CRCI bits require 5 bits of padding,
but there are no CRCI bits and no padding, when the number of TBs is
zero).

The *Payload CRC* IE is optional, i.e. the whole 2 bytes field may or
may not be present in the frame structure (this is defined at the setup
of the transport bearer).

#### 6.2.2.2 UL DATA FRAME FOR E-DCH TYPE 1

The structure of the E-DCH UL DATA FRAME TYPE 1 is shown in Figure 11a.
TYPE 1 frame structure is used when the E-DCH UL DATA FRAME is carrying
MAC-es PDUs (TS 25.321 \[16\]).

Figure 11a: E-DCH UL DATA FRAME TYPE 1 structure

For the description of the fields see subclause 6.2.4.

When there is an even, including zero, number of DDI + N field pairs for
a subframe, then 4 bits padding is used as shown in the figure in order
to have the octet aligned structure.

The *Payload CRC* IE is optional in frames that contain a Payload, i.e.
the whole 2 bytes field may or may not be present in the frame structure
(this is defined at the setup of the transport bearer). The *Payload
CRC* IE may only be present if the E-DCH UL data frame contains payload.

#### 6.2.2.3 UL DATA FRAME FOR E-DCH TYPE 2

The structure of the E-DCH UL DATA FRAME TYPE 2 is shown in Figure 11b.
TYPE 2 frame structure is used when the E-DCH UL DATA FRAME is carrying
MAC-is PDUs (TS 25.321 \[16\]).

For the description of the fields see subclause 6.2.4.

The *Payload CRC* IE is optional in frames that contain a Payload, i.e.
the whole 2 bytes field may or may not be present in the frame structure
(this is defined at the setup of the transport bearer). The *Payload
CRC* IE may only be present if the E-DCH UL data frame contains payload.

Figure 12: DL DATA FRAME structure

Bit 0 of New IE Flags in DL DATA FRAME structure indicates if CLTD-R is
present (1) or not (0) in the octet following the *New IE Flags* IE.
Bits 1 through 6 of New IE Flags in DL DATA FRAME shall be set to 0.

Field length of *Spare Extension* IE in DL DATA FRAME is 0-30 octets.

For the description of the fields see subclause 6.2.4.

There are as many TFI fields as number of DCH multiplexed in the same
transport bearer.

The DCHs in the frame structure are ordered from the lower DCH id
(\'first DCH\') to the higher DCH id (\'last DCH\').

The size and the number of TBs for each DCH are defined by the
correspondent TFI.

If the TB does not fill an integer number of bytes, then bit padding is
used as shown in the figure in order to have the octet aligned structure
(ex: a TB of 21 bits requires 3 bits of padding).

The *Payload CRC* IE is optional, i.e. the whole 2 bytes field may or
may not be present in the frame structure (this is defined at the setup
of the transport bearer).

### 6.2.4 Coding of information elements in data frames

header, i.e. from bit 0 of the first byte (the *FT* IE) to the bit 0
(included) of the last byte of the header (not including the *Header CRC
Cont* four bits), with one of the corresponding generator polynomials:\
G(D) = D^7^+D^6^+D^2^+1 for the 7 bit header CRC,

G(D) = D^11^ + D^9^ + D^8^ + D^2^ + D + 1 for the 11 bit header CRC.

See subclause 7.2.

**Field Length:** 7 bits. 11 bits for UL Data Frame for E-DCH.

#### 6.2.4.2 Frame Type (FT)

indicated as \"selected\" with the *QE-selector* IE in the control plane
(TS 25.433 \[4\] TS 25.423 \[6\]), then the QE is the transport channel
BER for the selected DCH. If no transport channel BER is available the
QE is the physical channel BER.\]

\[FDD - If the value of the *QE-Selector* IE equals \"non-selected\" for
all DCHs in the DCH FP frame, then the QE is the physical channel BER.\]

\[TDD - If no transport channel BER is available, then the QE shall be
set to 0. This is in particular the case when no transport blocks have
been received. The value of QE will be ignored by the RNC in this
case.\]

The quality estimate shall be set to the transport channel BER \[FDD -
or physical channel BER\] and be measured in the units TrCh\_BER\_LOG
\[FDD - and PhCh\_BER\_LOG respectively\] (see TS 25.133 \[7\] and TS
25.123 \[8\]). The quality estimate is needed in order to select a
transport block when all CRC indications are showing bad (or good)
frame. The UL outer loop power control may also use the quality
estimate.

**Description:** CRC for the payload. This field is optional. It is the
result of the CRC applied to the remaining part of the payload, i.e.
from the bit 7 of the first byte of the payload to the bit 0 of the byte
of the payload before the *Payload CRC* IE, with the corresponding
generator polynomial:\

6.3 Control frames
------------------

### 6.3.1 Introduction

Control frames are used to transport control information between SRNC
and Node B.

On the uplink, these frames are not combined -- all frames are passed
transparently from Node B to SRNC. On the downlink, the same control
frame is copied and sent transparently to all the Node Bs from the SRNC.

The structure of the control frames is shown in the figure 13.

7 Handling of Unknown, Unforeseen and Erroneous Protocol Data
=============================================================

7.1 General
-----------

A frame protocol frame with illegal or not comprehended parameter value
shall be ignored. Frame protocol frames sent with a CFN in which the
radio resources assigned to the associated Iub data port are not
available, shall be ignored.

Frame protocol data frames with CFN value that does not fulfil the
requirement set in clause \[FDD - 4.2.14 of TS 25.212 \[9\]\]
\[TDD - 4.2.12 of TS 25.222 \[10\]\], shall be ignored.

7.2 Error detection
-------------------

Error detection is provided on frames through a Cyclic Redundancy Check.
The length of the CRC for the payload is 16 bits, for the data frame
header 7 or 11 bits and for control frames it is 7 bits.

### 7.2.1 CRC Calculation

The parity bits are generated by one of the following cyclic generator
polynomials:

g~CRC16~(D) = D^16^ + D^15^ + D^2^ + 1

g~CRC11~(D) = D^11^ + D^9^ + D^8^ + D^2^ + D + 1

g~CRC7~(D) = D^7^ + D^6^ + D^2^ + 1

Denote the bits in a frame by $a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\ldots,a_{A_{i}}$, and
the parity bits by $p_{1},p_{2},p_{3},\ldots,p_{L_{i}}$. *A~i~* is the
length of a protected data and L*~i~* is 16, 11 or 7 depending on the
CRC length.

The encoding is performed in a systematic form, which means that in
GF(2), the polynomial for the payload

yields a remainder equal to 0 when divided by g~CRC16~(D), the
polynomial for the data frame header with 11 bit CRC

yields a reminder equal to 0 when divided by g~CRC11~(D) and the
polynomial for the data frame header with 7 bit CRC and control frame

yields a remainder equal to 0 when divided by g~CRC7~(D). If
$A_{i} = 0$, $p_{1} = p_{2} = p_{3} = \cdots = p_{L_{i}} = 0$.

#### 7.2.1.1 Relation between input and output of the Cyclic Redundancy Check

The bits after CRC attachment are denoted by
$b_{1},b_{2},b_{3},\ldots,b_{B_{i}}$, where *B~i~*=*A~i~*+*L~i~*.

The parity bits for the payload are attached at the end of the frame:

$b_{k} = a_{k}$ *k* = 1, 2, 3, ..., *A~i~*

$b_{k} = p_{(k - A_{i})}$ *k* = *A~i~* + 1, *A~i~* + 2, *A~i~* + 3, ...,
*A~i~* + *L~I~*

The parity bits for the frame header and the control frames are attached
at the beginning of the frame:

$b_{k} = p_{k}$ *k* = 1, 2, 3, ..., *L~i~*

$b_{k} = a_{(k - \text{Li})}$ *k* = *L~i~* + 1, *L~i~* + 2, *L~i~* + 3,
..., *L~I~ + A~i~*
