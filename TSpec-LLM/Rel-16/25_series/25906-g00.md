1 Scope
=======

The objectives of this study are:

a\) RAN4 to identify whether there are situations in which individual UE
receiver performance reduction has no, or minimal impact to the overall
UTRAN system level performance or user experience. RAN4 should also
identify scenarios in which UE receiver performance reduction cannot
safely be performed.

b\) RAN4 to investigate scenarios for the identified situations where
the UE could reduce its performance. The purpose of these scenarios is
to ensure that UE performance is not degraded when conditions are not
suitable.

c\) RAN2 to investigate additional signalling which may be beneficial to
support Ues in the decision making process for reducing their
performance, for example quality thresholds which assist the UE in
determining that conditions are suitable to reduce receiver performance.

4 Techniques considered for dynamically reconfiguring a FDD UE receiver to reduce power consumption when desired Quality of Service is met
==========================================================================================================================================

4.1 Scenarios in which individual UE receiver performance reduction has no, or minimal impact to the overall UTRAN system level performance or user experience
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 4.1.1 MBMS transmission

It is considered acceptable from the system perspective to reduce or
switch off UE receiver enhancements in good radio conditions when
receiving point to multi-point MBMS data (mapped on S-CCPCH). This is
because such transmission takes place with fixed transmission power
level and so does not provide any opportunity to reduce transmission
power when UE is operating in good conditions. When the same UE moves
into relatively worse radio conditions the enhanced receiver should be
fully enabled, to provide the better MBMS service reception. From a user
experience perspective, the important aspect is that UE attempts to
maintain a certain downlink quality target corresponding to enhanced
receiver performance requirements. This means that generally a UE in
good radio conditions has the opportunity to reduce its receiver power
consumption by reducing or turning off its receiver enhancements.
However, in order to ensure correct UE behaviour, the initial assessment
indicates that network should provide the desired quality target, which
the UE should then autonomously attempt to meet or exceed when enhanced
receiver is off. Determining 'good radio condition' based on the network
signalled quality target should be dependent on UE implementation, but
additional requirements scenarios may need to be developed by RAN4 to
ensure that Ues are able to meet or exceed the desired quality target in
different radio conditions and there is consistent behaviour between
different UE implementations.

Unlike dedicated channels, where the quality target is signalled to the
UE for the purpose of outer loop power control, no quality targets are
currently signalled for MBMS channels. Based on the analysis in RAN4 the
transport channel level BLER or SDU error rate is found to be a good
measure to determine MBMS quality (e.g. MTCH BLER or SDU error rate) and
the feasibility of additional signalling to create targets for such
measures could be further investigated by RAN2. It should also be noted
that the UE may either exceed the MTCH quality target, or be unable to
meet the MTCH quality target regardless of whether receiver enhancements
are enabled, so the definition of quality target is rather different
from the currently defined outer loop power control concept of a quality
target.

Due to the lack of signalling of quality target for p-t-m MBMS channels,
some level of standardization is needed to assist UE to do receiver
reconfiguration in p-t-m MBMS scenario. This could include specifying
the signalling of quality target and some test cases to ensure that the
UE attempts to follow the network signalled quality target.

4.2 Scenarios in which individual UE receiver performance reduction may impact to the overall UTRAN system level performance or user experience
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 4.2.1 HSDPA transmission

One main benefit of HSDPA is the ability to transmitted high data rate
in a very short period of time by exploiting the good radio conditions.
This enhances the user bit rate as well as the system throughput.
Secondly, the power control on HSDPA channels (HS-DSCH and HS-SCCH) is
implementation dependent. There is also an advantage to be gained in
terms of downlink transmit power reduction by using an enhanced
receiver. Thus it is generally beneficial for the network that UE fully
uses its enhanced receiver to measure CQI and for the demodulation of
HSDPA downlink channels

Furthermore, no procedure is required to be standardized to support any
possible receiver reconfiguration in HSDPA scenario. The standard
specifies the CQI reporting range, which UE should be capable of
reporting \[2\]. The standard also specifies the enhanced receiver
requirements, which are required to be fulfilled by the UE supporting
enhanced receiver \[3\]. While fulfilling these requirements any
possible receiver reconfiguration could be performed autonomously by the
UE without specifying any procedure in 3GPP specification.

Potential HSDPA reception scenarios where it might be desirable to
utilize UE dynamic receiver reconfiguration are explored in section 7.2.

### 4.2.2 Transmission on dedicated channels

This refers to scenario, where dedicated channels such as DCH and F-DPCH
are in operation. In these scenarios the closed loop power control
automatically adjusts the downlink transmitted power in response to the
variation in the downlink measured quality at the UE. Thus, a
continuously active enhanced receiver on dedicated channels will enable
the power control to reduce the downlink transmitted power compared to
the scenario where enhanced receiver is dynamically switched on and
switched off. The saved downlink power can be used to accommodate more
users in the cell, extend the cell coverage or to increase the data rate
transmission of the on going cells if needed.

Furthermore, no procedure is required to be standardized to support any
possible receiver reconfiguration in DCH scenarios. The network already
signals the quality target (BLER for DCH and TPC command error rate for
F-DPCH) \[4\]. The UE is required to fulfil these quality targets as
specified in TS 25.101 \[3\]. The UE supporting enhanced receiver should
also fulfil the relevant enhanced requirements according to TS 25.101
\[3\]. Thus, the specification provides sufficient information that can
be used by UE for implementing any autonomous receiver reconfiguration
algorithm.

Potential dedicated channels reception scenarios where it might be
desirable to utilize UE dynamic receiver reconfiguration is explored in
section 7.1.

### 4.2.3 E-DCH related downlink transmissions

In this scenario E-RGCH, A-RGCH and E-HICH channels, which are used for
scheduling and ACK/NACK transmission in the downlink to support enhanced
uplink operation are transmitted. The network can increase the coverage
of these channels by adjusting the downlink transmit power according to
the received downlink quality. This implies more enhanced uplink users
can be accommodated in the system if the downlink power is used more
efficiently. However, it should be noted that as HSUPA downlink channels
utilize high spreading factors and repetition, it may be possible for
users in certain favourable conditions to perform dynamic receiver
reconfiguration without impacting the overall number of enhanced uplink
users that can be accommodated in the system. Reconfiguration of
receiver related to E-DPCH downlink physical channels has not been
simulated.

It is expected that no procedure is required to be standardized to
support any possible receiver reconfiguration in E-DCH downlink channel
reception scenario. While fulfilling the enhanced requirements specified
in 25.101 \[3\] the UE could autonomously perform receiver
reconfiguration without the need for any standardized procedure.

5 MBMS Link level simulation scenarios, assumptions and results
===============================================================

Based on the analysis in section 4, it was decided to simulate MBMS
based scenarios. Initially, link level simulations were considered, but
later in the study it was agreed also to consider system simulation
scenarios.

5.1 Link level scenarios based on adaptive thresholds
-----------------------------------------------------

Based on the conclusion of section 4.1 link level simulation scenario to
investigate the feasibility of dynamic receiver reconfiguration were
agreed to be MTCH performance for point to multipoint MBMS transmission.
For the purposes of simulation, it was necessary to agree reference
switching algorithms, which provide a basis for determining whether the
UE receiver should be dynamically reconfigured to use a single receiver,
or configured to use dual receiver diversity. Since the choice of
switching algorithm may have an impact to the overall conclusion on
whether the techniques are feasible or not, two different algorithms
were proposed. Both switching methods assume that some quality target is
signalled from UTRAN in line with the discussion in section 4.1.1.
Method 1 is a rather basic method, where the UE makes an estimation of
BLER, and compares it directly with the BLER target. Switching method 2
was also considered, because it may offer the possibility for a more
rapid response when conditions change (e.g. due to short term fading)
and therefore the possibility for greater power savings.

It should be emphasised that both reference switching algorithms are
defined to facilitate simulation within RAN4, but while these algorithms
are used as basis for the work, they do not preclude more sophisticated
implementations.

### 5.1.4 Results

Link level results were contributed by Nokia and Panasonic

#### 5.1.4.1 Panasonic simulation results

Figure 5.1.4.1.1 and 5.1.4.1.2 show BLER performance versus S-CCPCH
Ec/Ior with several *δ* values. BLER performances for both single
antenna case and Dual antenna case are also shown in both figures. Our
results show that reference algorithm can settle BLER to 5% in each
S-CCPCH Ec/Ior and it doesn't depend on the value of *δ* values.

Results for both the simple reference switching algorithm, where the
receiver is reconfigured directly from the UE estimated BLER, and for
the more complicated algorithm where the BLER estimate is used to adapt
an inner loop are favourable, and from a BLER versus SCPPCH\_Ec/Ior
perspective both offer very similar performance. When the quality target
cannot be met, both algorithms make use of both receivers virtually 100%
of the time, and achieve very similar performance to the standard 2xRake
results with no switching. In good conditions, both algorithms make use
of one receiver virtually 100% of the time and achieve very similar
performance to the 1xRake results with no switching. In the transition
region, both algorithms control the receiver configuration to produce a
BLER close to the quality target.

Both algorithms offer the potential for good power saving opportunities,
and ensure that the UE receiver is almost never configured for RX
diversity operation when the performance target can be met with a single
receiver. The main difference between the two algorithms is in the
transition region where algorithm which adapts the receiver
configuration according to short term quality metric appears to be able
to show a greater power saving. Our understanding is that this happens
because it is able to respond opportunistically to changes in channel
conditions due to short term fading.

Based on these results, the indication is that dynamic receiver
reconfiguration is a feasible technique when receiving p-t-m MBMS
transmissions. Provided that a suitable quality target can be provided
to the UE, the technique appears to offer the possibility for power
saving opportunities without compromising the performance of the 2RX
when conditions are demanding.

6.2 System level results and conclusions
----------------------------------------

Figure 6.2.1 shows the CDF of SINR for various scenarios including 1RX,
2RX without switching, and 2RX with different switching thresholds. The
lower the switching threshold, the more aggressively the UE should be
regarded as attempting to save power.

From figure 6.2.1, it can be seen that at low SINR, the CDF of the
simulations where switching is allowed is close to the 2RX CDF without
switching. Hence at low SINRs the Ues capable of switching are behaving
very similarly to 2RX UE that does not perform any switching.
Conversely, at high SINR the behaviour of the switching Ues is very
close to that of a 1RX UE. The C/I threshold used determines the
breakpoint where the switching UE CDFs depart from the 2RX performance
curve.

In figure 6.2.2, statistics on how much time Ues spend configured to use
1RX and 2RX is presented. In this figure, number of antennas used is
measured over a single MBMS session, with a value of 1 indicating that
1RX was used for the entire duration, and a value of 2 indicating that
2RX was used for the entire MBMS session. For the least aggressive
switching thresholds \[-4,-9\] dB, the figure indicates that most users
are using both receivers for quite a lot of time. For example, only
approximately the best 10% of MBMS sessions have an antenna usage value
of lower than 1.8. As expected, more sessions are performed with lower
antenna usage when more aggressive thresholds are taken into use, and
for the most aggressive threshold corresponding to \[-7,-12\] dB some
50% of MBMS sessions have an antenna usage figure of less than 1.2. This
indicates that for this threshold, a significant proportion (e.g. 50%)
of the MBMS users would be expected to be experiencing worthwhile power
saving. Indeed some 20% of MBMS sessions are performed with only one
antenna used.

receiver reconfiguration between 2RX and 1RX at different C/I
thresholds.

Having established that at least for the more aggressive switching
thresholds' there are significant power saving opportunities being
offered to a significant number of users, it remains to consider whether
MBMS coverage is adversely impacted by the reconfigurations.

Coverage is presented in figure 6.2.3. An MBMS session is considered
satisfactory if the BLER during the 20s period is better than the
quality target. Both 1% (figure 5) and 10% quality targets were
simulated. For 1% quality target, and the given SCCPCH\_Ec/Ior level
(-11dB) approximately 99% coverage is achieved when all users have 2 RX
rake receiver. For all but the most aggressive switching schemes, figure
6.2.3 shows that overall MBMS coverage is virtually unaffected by the
switching, except when the most aggressive switching thresholds are used
\[-7,-12\]dB and even then, only when rather long C/I filtering is
performed. From the system level studies it appears that long sliding
window filtering of the measurements used to support RX diversity
reconfigurations introduces additional delay, and degrades performance
without giving any other significant benefit.

averaging window length (1% target for MBMS session BLER)

Figure 6.2.4 shows the spatial distribution of users making use of two
receivers. This provides some insight that there is not a sharp boundary
between areas where 2 RX configurations is never required and areas
where 2RX configuration is always required. Such intermediate behaviour,
where 2RX configuration is sometimes required to achieve the necessary
performance is also seen in link level results. Nevertheless, users who
are close to the node B make much less use of the 2 RX configurations,
as expected. The switching thresholds used to generate figure 6.2.4 were
\[-6,-11\]dB.

different spatial locations. Node B antenna directions are illustrated
at the centre of the image.

In this series of simulations, it has been demonstrated that it is
possible to achieve very similar coverage with an MBMS UE which
reconfigures between 1 RX Rake and 2 RX Rake receiver, when compared to
a UE which uses only 2 RX Rake receiver, provided that suitable
switching thresholds and C/I filtering window are used. At the same
time, antenna usage statistics indicate that there is the possibility
for favourable users to spend a significant amount of time using the 1
RX Rake configuration, which suggests that there are definite power
saving opportunities. We believe that the initial system simulation
results indicate that dynamic receiver reconfiguration is indeed a
feasible technique to reduce the power consumption relative to a UE
using 2 RX Rake and that there can be a significant reduction in
receiver activity without serious impact to MBMS coverage or quality of
service. Hence the results seen in the simulations presented indicate
that dynamic reconfiguration techniques are feasible for the scenario
considered.

However, the system level results also indicate that there is the
possibility of a reduction in coverage if the UE is too aggressive in
its switching, or uses an inappropriately long filtering period for the
measurements used to support switching (which implies increased delay in
the switching decisions). This result is not surprising, since it is
clear that a UE that was extremely aggressive in its switching would
give performance very similar to a 1 RX rake in many situations, and it
is also expected that long delays between making the measurements to
support switching and performing the actual switching are undesirable.
As with other aspects of UE performance which may have an impact to the
overall system performance, Nokia believes that if such dynamic receiver
reconfigurations are to be used in the future then requirements
scenarios should be defined in RAN4. In this way, we believe that it is
possible to ensure that Ues supporting dynamic receiver reconfiguration
between 2 RX Rake and 1 RX Rake behave appropriately and offer a very
similar level of performance overall to 2 RX Rake performance.

7 Non-MBMS link level simulation scenarios, assumptions and result
==================================================================

7.0 General
-----------

This section explores results of receive diversity (RxDiv)
reconfiguration for DCH/F-DPCH and HSDPA downlink channels under certain
conditions.

Switching algorithm methods are proposed for dedicated and HSDPA DL
channels separately. It should be stressed that in order for the UE to
turn off RxDiv, the conditions for doing so would need to be satisfied
for all physical channels currently being received by the UE.

7.1 Link level scenarios for dedicated channels
-----------------------------------------------

When in a near-site scenario the base station (BS) will be rather likely
at the *lowest minimum output power* because the dynamic power range of
the BS (typical values are 30 dB) may be smaller than the *path loss
dynamic* *range* (typical values are 70 dB). In this scenario, the
downlink transmitted power is not further reduced due to the use of a
RxDiv receiver at the UE and thus the RxDiv receiver can be switched
off. Furthermore, this scenario can be detected since the average
measured SIR remains above the target SIR when the transmitter reaches
the minimum power limit.

An algorithm for the RxDiv switching that was simulated is described in
the following sub-section.

### 7.1.1 Switching algorithm for DCH

The 3GPP standard defines the "high windup" condition as the state in
which the UE requests the BS to increase its transmit power, but the BS
has reached its upper limit and can not increase its power anymore. The
UE must recognize this condition, as otherwise it will increase its SIR
target too much, which will cause the UE to request excessive power when
exiting the high windup condition.

A similar problematic condition exists when the UE requests the BS to
lower its power, but the BS has reached its lower limit of transmit
power and can not reduce its power anymore. We refer to this as a "low
windup" condition. UE implementations must handle this condition
appropriately since otherwise they will lower their SIR target too much,
and subsequently many errors will occur when they exit this low windup
condition (until the power control outer loop is able to correct the SIR
target).

The detection of the low windup condition is quite robust, and can
enable the UE to identify the fact that its second antenna is not needed
for reception. We thus propose the following:

+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| If ((receiver is in low windup) and both receivers are enabled)      |
| switch to single receiver.                                           |
|                                                                      |
| If ((receiver is NOT in low windup) and only one receiver is         |
| enabled) switch to dual receiver.                                    |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

Low windup may be detected by various methods, e.g. by comparing SIR
estimation to SIR target, or by looking at the distribution of up and
down power control requests sent by the UE to the BS. Typically, the
detection of low windup is implemented with some kind of hysteresis that
would prevent frequent transitions between single receiver and RxDiv.

It should be noted that the low-windup estimation does not require any
assumptions about the downlink transmit power control settings. It is
based only on behaviour mandated by the 3GPP standard (TS 25.104 sec.
6.4.2.) that the base is required to respond to the UE's request to
lower power unless it has reached it lower power limit on transmit code
power.

A further enhancement to the suggestions above may be to also look at
the Block Error Rate (BLER) estimation or Symbol Error Rate (SER)
estimation.

If *on top* of the conditions specified in the suggestion above, the UE
also finds that the BLER estimation is below its BLER target (with some
margin), then it will decide to switch off the RxDiv, as this is a
further indication of the fact that the BS is at low windup.

This enhancement can help in test cases in which the BS does not perform
power control, since in the test case the BS will signal to the UE a
very low BLER target (which will not be met in the test), and thus the
UE will not switch off RxDiv and will maintain the required performance
for RxDiv receivers.

In channels such as Fractional DCH (FDCH) where a BLER target is
replaced by TPC command ER target (equivalent to Symbol Error Rate,
SER), the same principal can be maintained with SER estimation versus
SER target.

It is important to note, that when a UE is even near the condition of
low windup, the potential BS power savings that can be achieved by
utilizing RxDiv at the UE is minimal, since the transmitted BS power is
so low anyway. Thus the possibility that erroneously switching off RxDiv
under such conditions will degrade system capacity is negligible.

### 7.1.3 Simulation results

Link level simulation results were contributed by Marvell for STATIC and
CASE1 propagation channels.

#### 7.1.3.1 Static channel conditions

In Figure 7.1.3.1.1 and 2 below, the transmit power to the UE is shown
as a function of time for a UE receiving a DCH. During the simulation
the Ior/Ioc value is switched between -3 and 10 dB each second in order
to illustrate behaviour as the UE goes into and out of the low-windup
state. Three curves are shown as a function of time: (a) The top step
curve illustrates the Ior/Ioc value, (b) the middle step curve indicates
when the UE has detected a low-windup state -- i.e., when the curve is
at its lower level, and (c) the bottom curve indicates the Ec/Ior
transmitted from the base. For the figure on the right, the UE switches
to single antenna whenever low-windup is detected and it switches back
to dual-antenna whenever it leaves the low-windup state.

![](media/image24.wmf){width="5.999305555555556in"
height="2.3333333333333335in"}

\*Figure 7.1.3.1.1 and 2: Static channel simulation results for DCH
reception

It can be seen from these figures that very little additional downlink
power is needed to support the UE that does antenna dynamic
reconfiguration. Averaging over the simulations showed an increase of
average Ec/Ior from -27.94 dB (0.161%) to -27.48 dB (0.179%) when
switching off the second antenna, corresponding to an increase of 0.018%
in base transmit power.

#### 7.1.3.2 Case1 channel conditions

Figures 7.1.3.2.3 and 4 below show results analogous to those shown
above for Static channel conditions, and Figures 7.1.3.2.5 and 6 simply
provide a zoomed-in picture of the results. Case 1, which represents a
fairly flat-fading multipath channel model, is a reasonable model to use
for a user near the base station. It is also a difficult channel from
the point of view of antenna dynamic reconfiguration since there are
deep fades that take the UE out of low-windup.

Just as in the Static channel case, the figures illustrate that not much
additional power is needed to support the UE that does antenna dynamic
reconfiguration. Averaging over the simulations we saw an increase of
average Ec/Ior from -27.02 dB (0.199%) to -26.55 dB (0.221%) when
switching off the second antenna, an increase of 0.022% in base transmit
power. Changes of base station transmit power that are so small should
not affect network capacity.

We note that in the example given here, the UE practicing antenna
dynamic reconfiguration is able to remain in single-antenna mode 52% of
the time.

We also note from the curves that there is much more switching of
low-windup detection and antenna dynamic reconfiguration than in the
Static channel case. This is to be expected because of fading. In fact,
even when the second antenna is always on and Ior/Ioc is high we see
that there are times that fading causes the UE to leave the low-windup
state.

reception -- zoomed in

Longer term simulations of a UE with antenna dynamic reconfiguration
were also carried out to investigate the UE's ability to achieve its
quality BLER target, despite antenna dynamic reconfiguration. Results
are illustrated in Figure 5 with a zoomed-in version in Figure 8. Three
curves are shown as a function of time: (a) the top curve indicates
block errors (when raised), (b) the middle curve indicates the UE
detected low-windup state, (c) the bottom curve shows required Ec/Ior
from the base station. During the simulated time period, 9 block errors
occurred -- but all when 2 antennas were used; thus we can conclude that
the impact of antenna switching is negligible.

We note that the BLER for this time period was 0.72%, which is less than
the 1% target BLER. We note also that in this example a single antenna
was used 42% of the time and the averaged Ec/Ior was -26.17dB.

Figure 7.1.3.2.7 and 10 provide the same results as Figure 7.1.3.2.5 and
8 except that now the UE always uses 2 antennas. The total number of
block errors during the simulation was 12, with a BLER of 0.96% - very
similar numbers to those of the UE with antenna dynamic reconfiguration.
This further demonstrates that there is negligible performance
degradation for the UE utilizing antenna dynamic reconfiguration. In
addition, the average Ec/Ior was also very similar -- equal to -26.66dB.

7.2 Link level scenarios for HSDPA DL channels
----------------------------------------------

HSDPA may be used for services which require low BS resources. By low
resources we mean a small number of channelization codes and low
Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS).

An example is Voice over IP (VoIP), where a voice packet of 365 bits is
transmitted every 20 ms, or bundling 2 voice packets to 699 bits every
40 ms. In the first case, 1 channelization code will be used with QPSK
modulation and code rate 0.38, and in the second case, 2 channelization
codes will be used with QPSK modulation and code rate 0.36.

In this type of scenario, the BS and the UE will not gain anything from
improving reception quality beyond that required for this MCS (about 3
dB in AWGN for the worse case above), as there is no more data to send
to the UE.

### 7.2.1 Switching method algorithm for HSDPA

To take advantage of such conditions we suggest the following:

When the UE is aware of the fact that it only requires low BS resources
in HSDPA (e.g., by higher layer signalling), it should attempt to
identify whether RxDiv can be switched off without affecting
performance.

More specifically, the UE may measure its Channel Quality Indication
(CQI) and compare it to the CQI required by the service:

+----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| If ((Average CQI \> Required CQI+Threshold1) and both receivers are  |
| enabled) switch to single receiver.                                  |
|                                                                      |
| If ((Average CQI \<= Required CQI+ Threshold2) and only one receiver |
| is enabled) switch to dual receiver.                                 |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

This condition may be checked by either the UE or the BS as both are
aware of the CQI and MCS. Note that the CQI is directly determined based
on the SIR conditions. In the simulations performed, a base station
controlled method is assumed for HSDPA receiver reconfiguration.

### 7.2.2 Simulation conditions

In this section we present simulation results of HSDPA reception under
high Ior/Ioc conditions for several low-resource MCS scenarios that
might be relevant for antenna dynamic reconfiguration. Three reception
scenarios were tested: single antenna, dual antenna and antenna dynamic
reconfiguration (switching).

The following table summarizes the simulation conditions.

### 7.2.3 Simulation results

Table 7.2.3.1 summarizes the simulation results in terms of the required
Ec/Ior needed to achieve 10% BLER (with no transmission repetition) for
the given MCS and reception scenario. Also shown is the increased power
per code needed from the base station when antenna switching is used,
given as a percentage of maximum cell power. For the Static channel
case, antenna switching is not applicable since there is no fading; in
this case the increased power per code is given assuming the UE uses a
single antenna all the time.

In the Pedestrian A simulations, the antenna switching was base station
controlled. The decision to switch to single antenna was taken only if
the required transmit power was within 1 dB of low-windup, (in this case
-28 dB Ec/Ior). The delay involved in signalling the UE was not
modelled, but is not expected to significantly change the results. The
amount of time the UE was in single antenna mode was approximately 50% &
80% for the Ior/Ioc = 10 dB and 15 dB cases, respectively.

From the results we see that the increased power needed for these HSDPA
scenarios is generally very small (much less than 1%) and would not be
expected to significantly affect network performance. Ultimately, the
base station should decide based on its total power resource needs and
based on the MCS to be transmitted to the UE whether it makes sense to
permit the UE to switch to single-antenna mode. The signalling can be
efficiently implemented based on unused HS-SCCH bit combinations.

We note that the Pedestrian A antenna switching results are fairly close
to that of the dual-antenna results. The reason for this is that in a
flat-fading like channel such as Ped. A most of the errors occur during
the fades. However, during the fades the UE exits low-windup and both
antennas are used.

We also note that these simulations do not take into account possible
effects of scheduling. For low data rate HSDPA services that are not
particularly delay sensitive a scheduler will avoid transmitting to the
UE during fades, and thus improve both the single antenna and dual
antenna results. As a result the increased power needed to switch to
single antenna may be reduced further.

8 Non-MBMS system level simulation scenarios, assumptions and result
====================================================================

8.0 General
-----------

In section 0 it was proposed to allow a UE receiving dedicated channels
to switch off a second antenna when the UE is in "low-windup"
conditions. In the following section, network simulations results are
presented that illustrate the percentage of users that would be expected
to be in the low-windup state in a typical macro-cell scenario.

8.1 Network simulation assumptions
----------------------------------

The simulation assumptions are the same as those typically used in RAN4
studies and are listed in Table 8.1.1. We tested network loads of 12.5%,
25%, 50%, and 100%, where full load was approximately 2000 users.

8.2 Network simulation results
------------------------------

Figure 9 presents network simulation results that illustrate what
percentage of users would be expected to be in the low-windup state in a
typical macro-cell scenario.

Figure 9: Macro-cell network simulation results showing UE code power
CDF

Considering that the maximum base power was 43 dBm, and that the 3GPP
standard mandates minimum code transmit power no greater than -28 dB
relative to maximum base power, low-windup would typically occur at
10-15 dBm transmit power. From the figure we see that in fractionally
loaded cells this results in approximately 10-40% of the Ues being in
the low-windup state in this typical macro-cell scenario. We expect
these numbers to be even higher for in-building pico-cell and Home Node
B scenarios, where there may be typically fewer users, many of whom have
excellent reception conditions, with at least some insulation from
outside cells.

9 Conclusions
=============

Scenarios where dynamic receiver configuration provides minimal risk to
the user experience or UTRAN system level performance have been
identified and simulated at both the system and link level within this
study. Generally, it has been shown to be feasible for a UE receiving
MTCH to dynamically reconfigure from dual receiver to single receiver,
based on a signalled quality target.

In addition, analysis has been performed, which has indicated that HSDPA
reception, dedicated channel reception and E-DCH downlink feedback
channel reception are less suitable for dynamic receiver
reconfiguration, since there would be expected to be some system level
impacts or performance compromise and the full system level impact of
the reconfiguration may not be apparent to the UE making the
reconfiguration. There were also some analysis and simulation results
presented that indicated that under certain reception conditions
benefits could be achieved with negligible impact on system level
performance for these non-MBMS scenarios. However, it was concluded that
procedures related to receiver reconfiguration for non-MBMS channels
should not be specified in the 3GPP specifications.
