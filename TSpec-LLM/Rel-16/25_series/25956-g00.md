4 System Impacts of Repeaters
=============================

4.1 Error Vector Magnitude (EVM)
--------------------------------

The introduction of a repeater has an impact in the EVM of the system.
The basic effect is reflected in a system noise rise, which can be
calculated from the EVM value the received signal exhibits. The formula
is

Noise rise = 10 log(1 + EVM²)

In the scenario of a Repeater amplifying the signal the EVM of the
signal is calculated according to the following formula for uncorrelated
processes:

(EVM\_total)² = (EVM\_NodeB)² + (EVM\_Repeater)²

Taking the specified value of 17,5 % for both the Node B (as well as for
the UE) and the Repeater result in a total EVM of 24,7 %. Calculating
the noise rise for the Repeater scenario gives a value of 0,26 dB in the
area of the repeater\'s coverage. This compares to a noise rise in a
scenario without Repeater of 0,13 dB. The difference between the two
numbers is the worst-case closed loop power rise in an otherwise perfect
system that would occur with a Repeater being used.

4.2 Peak Code Domain Error (PCDE)
---------------------------------

In the specification of the Peak Code Domain Error value of the Repeater
-35 dB is used. The number for the Node B is -33dB. If we assume the
processes in the Repeater that lead to the PCDE being independent of the
equivalent process in the Node B we can assume that they can be treated
as noise. In this case the resulting value for PCDE is calculated from
the linear addition of the two signals that will lead to -31 dB. This is
a 2 dB degradation to the value of the Node B. For the repeated cell the
degradation might be negligible. In case of a neighbour cell the might
be affected to some extend. Presumably the soft handover gain will be
reduced by the tenth of a dB.

4.3 Frequency error
-------------------

The effect of the additional frequency error will be a reduction of the
maximum speed. In the repeater core specification the minimum
requirement on frequency stability is 0,01 ppm. Hence, with the 0,05 ppm
minimum requirement for the base station frequency stability the
resulting \"worst case\" for a signal that have been amplified by the
repeater is 0,06 ppm.

4.4 Adjacent Channel Leakage Ratio (ACLR)
-----------------------------------------

With regard to the mentioned ACLR we have to investigate the behaviour
of the Repeater. For this reason we use the model shown in the following
Figure 4.1:

Figure 4.1: Simplified Repeater model.

The Repeater in its basic function is bi-directional amplifier of RF
signals from Base Stations in the downlink path and from Universal
Equipments (UE) as mobile stations in the uplink path. The operating
bands in which the Repeater amplifies is determined by the IF filter in
its bandwidth and by the duplexer filter in its frequency range for
operational configuration. In our discussion we will use the parameters
defined in Table 4.1.

Table 4.1: Parameters of the Repeater model.

  ------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------- ------------------ --------------------------------------------------------------------

The Repeater output noise density can be calculated according to the
formula:

N\_Rep (30kHz) = N\_therm (30kHz) +NF + G = -34 dBm/30 kHz .

Considering the output of the Repeater in the Downlink path we will find
an average power 30 dBm in the WCDMA channel. This is resulting in a
signal density of

S\_Downlink = +9 dBm/30 kHz.

This leads to a signal-to-noise ratio of the Downlink of:

S / N\_Downlink = 43 dB.

The Adjacent Channel Leakage Ratio (ACLR) as defined for BS is stating
-45 dB for the first adjacent channel and -50 dB for the second adjacent
channel. This situation is illustrated in Figure 4.2.

In the Repeater case the resulting output frequency spectrum is shown
below.

Fig. 4.2: Repeater output frequency spectrum.

It is obvious that the ACLR cannot be measured in the Repeater case due
to the fact that the this signal is below the amplifier thermal noise of
the Repeater amplifier chain.

This even get worse when the Uplink is considered. As in this path the
maximum average value of the output power is reduced to 12 dBm resulting
in a signal power density of S = -9dBm / 30 kHz, the signal-to-noise
ratio will be even smaller:

S / N\_Uplink = -9 dBm / 30 kHz - (-43 dBm / 30 kHz) = 34 dB.

This collision is the reason why the ACLR requirement as it is written
for the BS equipment cannot be met with a Repeater. The ACLR measurement
will be limited by the thermal noise of the Repeater amplifier chain.

Spectral components (noise, ACP, intermodulation products, spurious
signals, \...) falling outside the operating band are fully addressed in
the TS 25.106 subclause 9.

4.5 Time Delay
--------------

Using common narrow band filter technologies (SAW) the IF-filtering
process introduces a time delay of about 5-6 μs to the signal. This puts
a requirement on the length of the receiver's search window. It is,
however, believed that the channel models now specified in TS 25.104 are
sufficient for guaranteeing the receiver's performance in an area
covered by both a repeater and a base station.

Figure 4.3 illustrates a case where the UE receives multipath signals,
both from the repeater and from the BS. Here, the repeater will
introduce artificial multipaths. This could possibly reduce the effects
from fading, but also increase the number of paths that are needed to
capture a certain percentage of the energy is increased and it is
therefore important to have a sufficient amount of RAKE fingers in the
receiver.

However, traditionally the repeater is deployed to cover a smaller area
compared to the BS and the number of resolvable multipaths could
therefore be believed to lower compare to that of macrocellular
deployment.

Fig. 4.3: Illustration of the excess multipaths that are introduced by
the repeater in a scenario where the UE is receiving the signal, from
both the BS and the repeater.

4.6 Location Services (LCS)
---------------------------

The co-existence between repeaters and location services (LCS) is
studied in this clause. Three methods for location services are
currently specified in TS 25.305: OTDOA, Cell coverage based positioning
and Network assisted GPS.

### 4.6.1 OTDOA

The OTDOA method is based on measurements of the UTRA pilot signal
(CPICH) made by the UE and the Location Measurement Unit (LMU). The
position of the UE is estimated by using the observed time difference of
arrival (OTDOA) from three, or more, base stations.

Figure 4.4 is an illustration of a network using repeaters. In this case
the signal path from BS4 to the UE can be either the direct path, with a
time delay of τ4, or the path through the repeater, with a time delay of
τRB+τd+τR, where τd is introduced by the repeater. This extra time delay
introduces an ambiguity when performing the location estimation.

Fig. 4.4: Illustration of the effect of a repeater installation in a
network using OTDOA based LCS.

To avoid this ambiguity different mechanisms can be implemented:

1\. For small cells one can exclude one of the signals if it has to long
path delay (i.e. passed through a repeater). Hence, for cells smaller
than 1500 m (corresponding to 5 μs) it is detectable, whether or not, a
repeater has transmitted the signal.

2\. If the UE detects more than three sites, as the case is in Figure
4.4, the measurement of the time delay from BS 3 can be excluded, based
on a too large relative difference to the time delays from BS 1-3. The
probability of detecting three sites is much lower compared to that of
detecting four or five sites. This result holds true for both the urban
and the suburban environment, when the UE uses 16 ideal periods.

### 4.6.2 Cell coverage based positioning method

The only impact is that the cells become larger using repeaters and that
this method thereby has less accuracy compared to a smaller cell. Other
than that the repeater does not affect this LCS method.

### 4.6.3 Network assisted GPS methods

The UTRA network can assist the UE GPS receiver in several ways. E.g. by
providing a frequency reference, since UTRAN has a better frequency
stability compared to GPS (0,05 ppm frequency error compared to 20 ppm).
UTRAN can also provide the UE with a timing reference to reduce the UE
GPS search time and improve the accuracy.

If a repeater is deployed in the network this will lead to about 5 μs
extra delay. This extra delay is not of the extent that it will affect
the performance of GPS assisted method. It is however important that the
frequency stability of UTRAN is maintained in the repeater.

4.7 Automatic Gain Control (AGC)
--------------------------------

Repeaters use a function called Automatic Gain Control (AGC) to adjust
the gain so that self-oscillation is avoided. The gain of the repeater
shall be adjusted so that there is a margin to the port isolation
between the up- and down-link directions as described in the sub-clause
Gain Settings.

As a consequence the AGC is not intended to the constantly adjust the
gain during the normal mode of operation. It shall be seen as a fall
back to prevent self-oscillation if, for some reason, the isolation
between the ports is reduced compared to the isolation measured during
the deployment or an increase in input power to a level larger than the
input level creating the maximum output power.

The AGC is also slow in comparison to the fast power control (the range
of several microseconds) in order not to interfere with the system
performance. The AGC should further adjust the gain in both the up and
downlink in order to make the repeater a transparent system element.

4.8 Adjacent Channel Rejection Ratio (ACRR)
-------------------------------------------

The secondary impact on the adjacent channel operator as described in
section 5.2.2 gives rise to a requirement of an explicit requirement on
ACRR in the requirement specification. After simulations described in
section 6.5 the requirements are introduced in the repeater
specifications.

5 Planning with Repeaters
=========================

5.1 Sole System
---------------

### 5.1.1 Antenna Isolation

Antenna isolation is an essential issue for the performance of a
repeater.

As a repeater only amplifies a received signal, it can act as an
oscillator under certain circumstances. The feedback path in this
amplifier system are the two antennas: coverage antenna and donor
antenna.

In order to prevent oscillation of the system, the feedback must be
lower than the amplifier gain. This loss in the feedback path is called
the *Antenna Isolation*. It must be 15 dB higher than the repeater gain
to guarantee an adequate protection against self-oscillation of the
repeater.

Several factors have influence on the antenna isolation:

**1. Antenna pattern (Horizontal and vertical)**

The optimum is a combination of donor and coverage antennas that are
mounted the way that there is a null in the antenna pattern in the
direction pointing towards the other antenna. A null means minimum
antenna gain in the specified direction.

As both antennas are usually mounted in opposite directions, it is
useful to chose both donor and coverage antenna types that have a high
front-to-back ratio.

**2. Vertical separation**

Typical antennas that are used for repeater sites have a narrower
aperture in the vertical antenna pattern, the vertical distance of the
antenna influences the isolation of the antenna system. In a typical
configuration, when both antennas are mounted on a pole, there is a null
in the antenna pattern pointing vertically up and down from the
antenna's feeding point. If there is a horizontal separation between the
antennas, additional lobes in the vertical antenna pattern have to be
taken into account.

**3. Environment of both antennas**

The environment of the antennas is a very important factor. The
reflection and attenuation properties of all materials near the antenna
can influence the antenna isolation drastically.

• The waves transmitted by antennas are reflected by surfaces, depending
on the materials. If there is a reflection from a building towards the
pole with the mounted antennas, this can decrease the antenna isolation
by more than 10 dB.

• The material of the tower itself has also an effect on the isolation:
If both antennas are mounted on a tower made of concrete, this improves
the antenna isolation, as signals are attenuated and reflected by the
material of the tower. A steel grid tower however might not increase
antenna isolation particularly, as the distances between the single
elements might be bigger than half a wavelength, which means that
radiated power can pass the tower almost unattenuated. In this case,
antenna isolation is more dependent on the antenna patterns.

• Shielding grids mounted near the antennas have also an effect on the
isolation. Generally, isolation can be improved using a shielding grid
by approximately 5 dB. This depends on the shape of the shielding grid.
Grids that are shaped according to the antenna outlook are better than
simple ones.

### 5.1.2 Coupling loss measurements

The links of most the interest are the coupling loss between the Node B
(Base Station = BS) and the repeater and at the repeater between the
donor- and the coverage antenna.

**1. Coupling loss between the Node B and the repeater.**

1\) Connect a Measurement User Equipment to the donor antenna and
measure the incoming pilot signal.

2\) The coupling loss between Node B and the repeater is then calculated
as

CL = BS Pilot Level output power \[dBm\] - Measured input power at the
Measurement User Equipment \[dBm\].

**2. Coupling loss at the repeater between the donor- and the coverage
antenna.**

1\) Connect the input of a spectrum analyser to the donor antenna cable

2\) Set up the instrument for the desired UMTS band.

3\) Connect a signal generator to the coverage antenna cable of the
repeater.

4\) Set up the analyser for the highest possible sensitivity (more than
-100dBm) for 0 dBm source-power.

5\) Set the analyser to \"max-hold\" if you do not use a tracking
generator.

6\) Set the output-power of the generator to 0 dBm.

7\) Start sweeping

8\) The minimum isolation is the highest value of the curve (except
carriers transmitted by surrounding BS). (Note the highest value for
further use.)

9\) Change measurement-ports to check for the opposite direction by
repeating the measurement procedure. (Note the worst value of isolation
for further use.)

### 5.1.3 Gain Settings

Considering the repeater application in an isolated UMTS system, the
basic rule as described above applies for both up-link and down-link:

G~repA~ ≤ Repeater port isolation - 15 dB

For the down-link the following rule of thumb ensures that the repeater
AGC (Automatic Gain Control) is not activated during normal traffic
conditions.

G ≤ Pmax~RepA~ + EDoCL~BSA-RepA~ - Pmax~BSA~

In cell planning, the repeater can be modelled as a base station with
transmit power

P~RepA~ = P~BSA~ - EDoCL~BSA-RepA~ + G~RepA~ (dBm)

For the up-link, the repeater has a transferred sensitivity;

Sensitivity~RepA~ = Sensitivity~BSA~ - (EDoCL~BSA-RepA~ - G~RepA~) (dBm)

The transferred sensitivity is controlled by the setting the repeater
gain in relation to the effective donor coupling loss. It is recommended
that the transferred sensitivity is approximately (5 to 10) + Nf~repA~
dB less than the donor base station sensitivity, in order not to
desensitise the base station. This rule can be adjusted in the case
where the repeater coverage area is also the main coverage area of the
base station. The term \"noise margin\", M, is introduced to describe
the difference between the base station sensitivity and the transferred
repeater sensitivity in the installation.

M~RepA~ = EDoCL~BSA-RepA~ - G~RepA~ (dB)

The gain should be set so that the link balance through the repeater
path is the same as the link balance in the donor base station. The loss
of diversity gain may here be considered.

### 5.1.4 Delay

The UTRA BS and UEs can handle a 20 μs time delay between two paths
(c.f. TS 25.101 and TS 25.104). The repeater introduces a time delay of
5-6 μs. The signal paths introduced through the repeater will be longer
than the direct path, both due to the extra travelling distance required
for the signal (approximately 5 µs per 1.5 km) and due to the group
delay in the repeater itself.

For outdoor repeater coverage, where the areas can be substantial, it is
a rule of thumb that the repeater site should be placed between the
repeater service area and the donor base station.

For applications with donor signal provided via optical fibre, it should
be noted that the speed of light in fibres is approximately 2/3 of that
in vacuum, or 5 µs per km. This may introduce extra delay to be
considered when designing both indoor and outdoor repeater applications.

5.2 Co-existence with UTRA FDD
------------------------------

### 5.2.1 Out of band gain

In the UTRA repeater core specification TS 25.106 the out of band
requirement have been derived assuming an in-band gain of 90 dB. The
rationale for this value was the common understanding that it represents
a maximum gain value for UTRA repeaters and that UTRA repeaters with
higher value are very unlikely. In most application the repeater gain
may be adjusted to lower values.

With a reduction of the in-band gain value, compared to the assumed 90
dB, the out of band gain values, which decides the adjacent channel gain
(ACG) will also be reduced compared to the values occurring in the
specification TS 25.106.

### 5.2.2 Isolation

Taking other operator systems into concern, it is the responsibility of
the repeater operator to make sure that the repeater installation does
not significantly alter the cellular design of the uncoordinated
operator.

In the case where a repeater is installed in the vicinity of a base
station operating on the adjacent channel the required isolation between
base station B and the repeater's donor port will depend on the up-link
gain. It can be seen that the signal from UEB to BSB can take the two
paths \"directly\" or \"via repeater A\", both of which comprise
multi-paths. It is here assumed that the path through the repeater will
be badly distorted, since the delay spread in the adjacent carrier
frequencies are bound to be substantial. As a consequence, the signal
travelled through the repeater is considered to be interference only.
However, this interference will have a fixed relation to the signal
power from UEB arriving in BSB since it follows the power control
applied from BSB on UEB.

The term \"self-interference\", is here introduced to describe this
phenomenon. SsIR (Signal to self Interference Ratio) is the relation
between the power level of the distorted UEB signal from the repeater A
path and the undistorted signal arriving direct from the UE, taken on
the BSB receiver terminal. The effect of putting the SsIR to 0 dB is
that a UEB with this SsIR occupies twice the air interface capacity from
BSB as required from a UE with infinite SsIR utilising the same service.

Now, in order to ensure the stability of system B a proper SsIR must be
set, resulting in a minimum requirement for the isolation between the
repeater A donor port and the base station B receive port:

CL~BSB-RepA~ ≥ SsIR + ACG~RepA~ - CLmin~RepA-UEA~ + CL~BSB-UEB~ (dB)

It is here assumed that the UE of system A and the UE if system B can
enter the same areas and hence

CL~RepA-UEA~ = CL~RepA-UEB~.

The CLmin~RepA-UEA~ is the minimum Coupling loss that can be experienced
between the repeater and the UE. It is assumed that the coupling loss
between the repeater and an UE in the repeater service area will vary
more than the coupling loss between BSB and the same UE. CL~BSB-UEB~ is
taken where CLmin~RepA-UEA~ occurs.

The ACG~RepA~ can be calculated as the gain set in repeater A minus the
repeater's Adjacent Channel Rejection Ratio (ACRR). The ACRR of the
repeater can be estimated as the maximum gain that can be set in the
repeater minus the adjacent channel maximum gain as stated in TS.
25.106,section 8.1, unless otherwise stated by the repeater
manufacturer. E.g. the gain of 90 dB assumed as Gmax~repA~ renders the
ACRR~repA~ of 37 dB according to TS 25.106.

The above described formulae for CL~BSB-RepA~ do not take into account
the absolute power and spurious emission requirements put forward in TS
25.106, section 9.1. The required coupling losses between the
repeater\'s donor port and base station B are derived using the unwanted
emission requirements in the first adjacent channel (TS 25.106 section
9.1.1):

For Pmax~RepA~ ≥ +39 dBm;

CL~BSB-RepA~ ≥ 105 dB

For +31 dBm ≤ Pmax~RepA~ \< +39 dBm;

CL~BSB-RepA~ (dB) ≥ Pmax~RepA~ (dBm) + 66 dB

For Pmax~RepA~ \< +31 dBm;

CL~BSB-RepA~ ≥ 97 dB

The required coupling losses are calculated according to the requirement
that the spurious emission level does not exceed -126 dBm/100 kHz at
base station B\'s receive port (corresponding to spurious emission
requirement for co-located BS, c.f. TS 25.104 and a 30 dB MCL, c.f. TR
25.942). Normal up-link powers are in the range of 0 dBm - 20 dBm.

In the downlink direction the UTRA repeater specification TS 25.106
includes additional requirement on spurious emission for the protection
of co-located UTRA FDD BS receivers. If these additional requirements
are applied, the isolation between the coverage antenna and the base
station antennas should be more than 30 dB.

Given the above recommendations, the coverage antenna should be put
closer to the BS antennas than the donor antenna should where repeaters
are co-sitting with UMTS FDD base stations. The isolation required
between the donor antenna and the service antenna will generate the
isolation required between the donor antenna and the co-sited base
station antenna. It is also recommended to use a high gain donor antenna
with narrow horizontal beam width so that the UL power is directed
exclusively towards the donor BS.

#### 5.2.2.1 Example on application of equations

Assume an area where two UMTS operators, A and B, are using adjacent
RF-channels.

Operator A wants to put a repeater in a position in the area. The
coupling loss between the repeater donor port and the donor BS is
measured to be 100 dB (using a UE from operator A connected to the
antenna feeder to be connected to the repeater donor port.) Applying a
noise margin of 10 dB, the repeater gain is set to 90 dB. The service
antenna is mounted so that the repeater antenna isolation requirements
are fulfilled.

The minimum coupling loss between a UE A and the repeater service port
is measured to be 70 dB (total coupling loss through the repeater is
measured to be 80 dB, and hence the coupling loss between the repeater
and the UE is less by the set noise margin). A UE from operator B is
used to measure the coupling loss between the UEB and the BSB in this
point. The result is 100 dB coupling loss. The Adjacent channel
rejection ratio is estimated to be 37 dB as described above. The SsIR at
this point is set to 0 dB (implying that it will be lower every where
else), and hence the minimum required coupling loss between the repeater
donor port and the BS B is calculated to be 83 dB. The coupling loss
between the BS B and the repeater donor port can be verified by
connecting the UE B to the donor antenna feeder at the repeater site and
measuring it.

5.3 Co-existence with UTRA TDD
------------------------------

### 5.3.1 Isolation

In the downlink direction the UTRA FDD repeater specification TS 25.106
includes additional requirement on spurious emission for the protection
of co-existence with UTRA TDD. If these additional requirements are
applied, the isolation between the coverage antenna and the base station
antennas should be more than 30 dB.

For the donor antenna, the repeater should have the same coupling loss
values to the BS as described in the section above.

5.4 Co-existence with GSM 900 and/or DCS 1800
---------------------------------------------

### 5.4.1 Isolation

Co-existence and co-siting with GSM 900 and/or DCS 1800 is addressed in
the UTRA repeater performance specification where additional
requirements exist for these scenarios.

If these additional requirements are applied, the isolation between the
coverage antenna or donor and the base station antennas should be more
than 30 dB.

5.5 Environments with low minimum coupling loss (MCL)
-----------------------------------------------------

This section addresses the use of and planning with repeaters in
environments with a Minimum Coupling Loss (MCL) of 40 dB. The cases are
studied, one where the repeater\'s parameters are intended for general
applications and one where they have been changed to align with the MCL
value investigated. In the examples below \"A\" indicate the channel
being amplified by the repeater and \"B\" the service at the adjacent
channel.

### 5.5.1 Normal repeater parameters

The following parameters are seen to represent a repeater intended for
normal applications;\
P\_max\_DL (maximum power down-link) = 30 dBm\
P\_max\_UL (maximum power up-link) = 12 dBm (the value can be reduced
with respect to the Downlink due to the uplink power control mechanism)\
G (gain, common for both directions) = 90 dB\
NF (noise figure) = 5 dB

The coupling loss between the repeater and the base station is 100 dB
and the output power of 30 dBm is thus the result of a 40 dBm BS output
power.

If we now investigate the maximum received power for UEA we find that:

P\_received\_max\_UEA = 30 dBm (P\_max\_DL) - 40 dB (MCL) = -10 dBm.

This value is 15 dB greater that the minimum requirements on the maximum
UE received power of -25 dBm (TS 25.101) and hence quality degradation
or dropped calls can be expected.

Further, the down-link interference at UEB due to the UE\'s Adjacent
Channel Selectivity (ACS) can be calculated by using the 33 dB ACS value
given in TS 25.101:

I\_UEB = 30 dBm (P\_max\_DL) - 40 dB (MCL) -33 dB (ACS) = -43 dBm.

This interference level is clearly to great in comparison to the signal
levels that can be expected on down-link of service B. As a consequence
quality degradation or dropped calls can be expected.

In conclusion it can be stated that a the usage of a repeater with
normal parameters setting (given above) will result in dropped calls on
the down-link, both the operator installing the repeater as well as
operators at adjacent channels, when used in an environment with a 40 dB
MCL. This should hence be avoided.

### 5.5.2 Repeater parameters adjusted to low MCL 

To function in an environment with a 40 dB MCL the maximum output power
in the down-link of the repeater have to be adjusted so that the maximum
UE received power does not exceed -25 dBm. This lead to the following
set of parameters:\
P\_max\_DL (maximum power down-link) = 15 dBm\
P\_max\_UL (maximum power up-link) = -3 dBm (the difference between UL
and DL is kept as in section 5.5.1)\
G (repeater gain, common for both directions) = 72 dB (the gain is given
considering the coupling loss to the BSA)\
NF (noise figure) = 5 dB

With a 15 dBm maximum down-link output power, the down-link interference
for UEB due to the UE\'s Adjacent Channel Selectivity (ACS) can be
calculated by using the 33 dB ACS value given in TS 25.101:

I\_UEB = 15 dBm (P\_max\_DL) - 40 dB (MCL) -33 dB (ACS) = -58 dBm.

This interference level is fairly large and might cause quality
degradation or dropped calls, but is a value in the range that can be
expected if a UE is in the vicinity of other operators base stations or
repeaters. To study the up-link interference generated by the repeaters
out of band gain the minimum and maximum UE output is used. Further, the
out of band values specified in the repeater core specification TS
25.106 are based on a 90 maximum gain value. By back calculation the
Adjacent Channel Rejection Ratio (ACRR) of the filters in the repeater
can be calculated to be 37 dB. Hence, if the in-band gain of the
repeater is lower compared to the assumed 90 dB the out of band gain
will be reduced accordingly.

If UEB is transmitting at minimum output power the up-link interference
at BSB can be calculated as:

I\_BSB = -50 dBm (P\_min\_UE) - 40 dB (MCL) + 72 dB (G) -37 dB (ACRR) -
100 dB (CL~BSB-Rep~) = -155 dBm.

This value is very low compared to the thermal noise of the BS and can
hence have no impact on the sensitivity.

To study the case when the UEB is transmitting at maximum output power
we first study the power received in the repeaters operating band. This
is calculated using the UE ACLR of 33 dB (according to TS 25.101
V3.4.0). In the repeater specification TS 25.106 there are requirements
on the Automatic Gain Control (AGC), this functionality ensure that the
amplifiers of the repeater is not driven into saturation by lowering the
gain if a high input signal is applies.

Now, with the maximum output power in the repeaters up-link of -3 dBm
the reduction of the gain in the operating band can be calculated as:

G = -3 dBm (P\_max\_UL) -21 dBm (P\_max\_UE) + 40 (MCL) + 33 (UE ACLR) =
49 dB.

With this new value of the repeaters gain the up-link interference given
as:

I\_BSB = 21 dBm (P\_max\_UE) - 40 dB (MCL) + 49 dB (G) -37 dB (ACRR) -
100 dB (CL~BSB-Rep~) = -107 dBm

a value which is 5 dB below the thermal noise floor of the BS resulting
in sensitivity degradation of about 1 dB.

The maximum power from UEA at BSA has been reduced due to impact of UEBs
ACLR on the repeater\'s gain. The resulting value would be:

P\_max\_received\_BSA = 21 dBm (P\_max\_UE) - 40 dB (MCL) + 49 dB (G)
-100 dB (CL~BSB-Rep~) = -70 dBm.

However, this value is still far greater than the maximum uplink power
can deliver but also a much greater level than what is needed at the BS.
Also, with BS reference sensitivity of -121 dBm the resulting
transferred sensitivity and the repeater is calculated as:

Sensitivity~RepA~ = -121 dBm (BS sensitivity) + 100 dB (CL~BSB-Rep~) -
49 dB (G) = -70 dBm.

The conclusion is that by an adjustment of the repeater parameters to a
MCL of 40 dB the co-existence problems are mitigated. However, due to
the UE ACLR impact on the repeater gain it is recommended that care be
taken so that the installation results in a MCL greater than 40 dB. With
a high MCL value the operator can ensure that repeaters coverage area is
maintained when UEs from adjacent channels are in the close proximity.

5.6 Analysis of out of band gain in the 3^rd^ adjacent channel
--------------------------------------------------------------

### 5.6.1 MCL=70 dB

In this case following parameters are seen to represent a repeater
intended for normal applications and typical coupling loss values;

Pmax\_DLrep (maximum power down-link) = 30 dBm.

Pmax\_ULrep (maximum power up-link) = 12 dBm (the value can be reduced
18 dB with respect to the Downlink due to the uplink power control
mechanism).

G\_maxrep (maximum repeater Gain, common for both directions) = 90 dB.

CLBSB-Rep (Coupling loss between repeater and base station B) = 100 dB.

MCLUEB-rep (Mutual Coupling Loss between the repeater and the UEB) = 70
dB.

ACG3rep (Adjacent Channel Gain in the 3rd adjacent channel) = 35 dB.

ACCR3rep (Adjacent Channel Rejection Ratio in the 3rd adjacent channel)
= G\_maxrepeater - ACG3rep = 55 dB.

In addition the following parameters are used in the analysis:

P\_maxUEB (UEB maximum UL power, operating at a frequency corresponding
to the repeaters 3rd adjacent channel)= 21 dBm.

ACS3UEB (the UE's selectivity in the 3rd adjacent channel)= 52 dB

P\_maxBSB (BS B maximum DDL power) = 40 dBm.

**Up-link interference**:

Under the assumption that the signal amplified by the repeater outside
of the operating band is interference, the resulting level at the base
station can be calculated as

I\_ULBSB = 21 dBm (P\_maxUEB) - 70 dB (MCLUEB-rep) + 90 dB (G\_maxrep) -
55 dB (ACCR3rep)- 100 dB (CLBSB-Rep) = -114 dBm.

**Down-link interference**:

In the analysis of down-link interference, we compare the interference
generated by the repeater\'s out of band gain (referred to ACG) to that
caused by the UE\'s blocking sensitivity (ACS), where the values have
been obtained with back calculations from TS 25.101:

I\_DLUEB (ACG) = 40 dBm (P\_maxBSB) -100 dB (CLBSB-Rep) + 35 dB
(ACG3rep)\
- 100 dB (CLBSB-Rep) = -95 dBm.

I\_DLUEB (ACS)= 30 dBm (Pmax\_DLrep) -70 dB (MCL) -52 dB (ACS3UEB)\
= -92 dBm.

I\_DLUEB (ACG+ACS) = -90,2 dBm

I.e. the additional interference generated by the repeater\'s out of
band gain is 1,8 dB.

### 5.6.2 MCL=40 dB

In this case the repeater\'s output power and gain is adjusted to a 40
dB MCL leading to the following;

Pmax\_DLrep (maximum power down-link) = 15 dBm.

Pmax\_ULrep (maximum power up-link) = -3 dBm.

Grep (Gain, common for both directions) = 75 dB.

CLBSB-Rep = 100 dB.

MCLrep-UEB = 40 dB.

ACG3rep = 75 dB (Grep) - 55 dB (ACRR3rep) = 20 dB.

In addition the following parameters are used in the analysis:

PmaxUEB (operating at a frequency corresponding to the repeaters 3rd
adjacent channel) = 21 dBm.

ACS3UEB (the UEs selectivity in the 3rd adjacent channel) = 52 dB

P\_maxBSB = 40 dBm.

**Up-link interference**:

With a 40 dB MCLrep-UEB the repeater\'s gain is reduced by the repeater
AGC due to the UEB\'s unwanted emission. The new inband gain level can
be calculated as

G\_newrep = -3 dBm (Pmax\_ULrep) - -23 dBm (Pspur.maxUEB) + 40
(MCLrep-UEB) = 60 dB,

i.e. a reduction with 15 dB compared to the original settings.

Using this new inband gain level we calculate the up-link interference
as:

I\_ULBSB = 21 dBm (PmaxUEB) - 40 dB (MCLrep-UEB) + 60 (G\_newrep)

\- 55 dB (ACCR3rep) - 100 dB (CLBSB-Rep) = -113 dBm.

**Down-link interference**:

I\_DLUEB (ACG) = 40 dBm (PmaxBSB) -100 dB (CLBSB-Rep) + 60 dB
(G\_newrep)\
- 55 dB (ACCR3rep) - 40 dB (MCLrep-UEB) = -95 dBm.

I\_DLUEB (ACS)= 15 dBm (Pmax\_DL rep) -40 dB (MCLrep-UEB) -52 dB
(ACS3UEB)\
= -77 dBm.

I\_DLUEB (ACG+ACS) = -77 dBm.

As seen the interference caused by the repeater\'s out of band gain can
be neglected compared to that caused by the UE\'s selectivity.

6 System Simulations and Analysis
=================================

6.1 Down-link co-existence simulations
--------------------------------------

This section is intended to analyse a co-existence scenario between a
UTRA repeaters and UTRA services at adjacent channels.

Consider two operators (Operator A and B) that have base stations
operating at adjacent frequencies located in the vicinity of each other
and with equal EIRP. Further, consider also a down link macro scenario
where the signal level is insufficient near the border of the cell, and
one of the operators (Operator A) places a repeater there to strengthen
the signal.

When there are no ideal filters or amplifiers available, the signal in
the repeater will leak into the adjacent channel and causing an area
around the repeater site with increased interference in the adjacent
frequency.

The interference on frequency B at the repeater in this scenario
consists of four components:

1\. The out of band emission from operator A\' base station that is also
amplified by the repeaters adjacent channel gain (ACG).

2\. The signals from operator B\' base station that is amplified by the
repeaters ACG. In the analysis this signal is treated as interference.

3\. The out of band emission produced by the repeater.

4\. The interference caused by the adjacent channel selectivity (ACS) in
the receiving mobile.

Hence, the effect of the three first (1-3) interference components are
caused by the repeater\' ACG and out of band emission, and the last one
by the filter in the mobile station.

The simulations is based on a macro path loss model describe in TS
25.942 \"RF Scenarios\". Though this model has its limitations in the
vicinity of the transmitter, it indicates how large the outage zone will
be. The simulation assumptions are described in the Appendix. The
repeater is placed at a distance of 1.5 km with a donor antenna that has
LOS conditions to the base station. The coupling loss to the repeater is
100 dB and with 90 dB gain the output power is 33 dBm.

In the results below the outage zone is defined as the area, where SIR
\< -8 dB.

Figure 6.1: Simulation on the received average power from a base station
on two 5 MHz channels, frequency A and B.

In Figure 6.1, the output power is the same for both base stations.
P~r,freqB~ represents a signal on frequency B and P~r,freqA~ on
frequency A where a repeater is used. I~freqB~ indicates the
interference on frequency B that the base station and repeater on
frequency A have produced.

In Figure 6.1 the received signal from the two base stations are shown
and also the interference level on operator B\' band. The
signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) around the repeater site is
illustrated in Figure 6.2. The outage zone is defined as the area where
the mobile is unable to hold a channel with SIR requirement of -8 dB.
The channel gain (CG) in the repeater is 90 dB and ACG is 50 dB.

The outage zone is 62 m if only interference components 1-2 are
considered. If also 3 is applied the outage zone is 67 m. If the effect
of the receiver selectivity, ACS, in the mobile is also taken in account
the outage zone becomes 103 m. If ACG in the repeater is set to zero the
outage zone will get 99 m.

![](media/image9.png){width="3.932638888888889in"
height="2.953472222222222in"}

Figure 6.2: The figure shows the signal-to-interference (SIR) ratio and
the threshold of -8 dB. The outage zone where the SIR drops below this
threshold is around 103 m.

The outage zone as a function of ACG is shown in Figure 6.2. The results
shown in the Figure 6.3 indicate that the impact of ACG on the outage
zone is very small up to an ACG of about 55 dB.

![](media/image10.png){width="3.932638888888889in"
height="2.953472222222222in"}

Fig. 6. 3: Two cases are studied; one where only the interference impact
is generated by the repeater and the other where also the selectivity
limit is taken into account in the mobile. The red line shows the outage
area with an ACG equal to zero.

It is shown with simulations that most interference comes from the
selectivity in the receiving mobile, if the repeater in this scenario
has a adjacent channel gain that is less than 55 dB.

6.2 Outdoor coverage (High CL~Rep-UE~)
--------------------------------------

The repeater is located close to an area with poor signal strength. The
link between repeater and Base Station (BS) is assumed to have a minimum
Coupling Loss (CL) of 100 dB (Taken from TS 45.050). The minimum
coupling loss between the Mobile Station (MS) and the repeater is
assumed to be 70 dB (Taken from TS 25.201). The gain in the repeater of
90 dB is assumed to be a really high value, in practice a more realistic
value would be less than that. The noise figure (F) of 5 dB in the
repeater is the same as for base stations.

Fig. 6.4: Schematic illustration of the radio link between BS and MS via
a Repeater.

The received signal strength at the MS after the repeater is below the
maximum receiving power. Also the BS can with power control set the MS
so the received power at BS is below the sensitivity level.

6.3 Indoor coverage (Low CL~Rep-UE~)
------------------------------------

The repeater is located so it takes the outside received signal and
transmits it inside a building, and vice versa. Inside the building it
is assumed to have about 40 dB as minimum coupling loss. The 40 dB
coupling loss comes from TS 45.050.

6.4 Repeater up-link co-existence simulations
---------------------------------------------

### 6.4.1 General

This section analyses an up-link co-existence scenario between a UTRA
repeaters and UTRA services at adjacent channels. Simulations are
performed to analyse the effect of the interference generated by the
repeater\'s out of band gain on services at adjacent channel.

Two scenarios are studied, one where the operator with the repeater
deployed (operator A) and the operator at the adjacent carrier (operator
B) have co-ordinated base station deployment (using the same sites) and
one where the two networks are uncoordinated (using different sites).
Both operators have a 3-sector cell planning with 65° antennas. The
co-ordinated and uncoordinated scenarios are illustrated in Fig. 6.6 and
6.7, respectively. The out of band gain value used in the simulations
corresponds to the value in TS 25.106 for the first adjacent channel
gain.

Since the interference generated by the repeater\'s out of band gain is
relative to the power received in the adjacent channel the interference
level will vary with the load in operator B\'s network. Hence, if
operator B has an unloaded network no interference will be generated.
Due to this property a scenario is chosen where operator B has a load of
50 simultaneous user per sector using 12.2 kbps services. As a
consequence the BS receiver sensitivity will be slightly lowered,
compared to the referenced sensitivity, due to inter- and intracell
interference.

To include these effects a 5 dB noise increase have been assumed for all
the base stations in operator B\'s network, thus resulting in a BS
sensitivity of about -98 dBm[^5]. Further, all the UE\'s in the network
are connected with 12.2 kbps up-link, and a required E~b~/N~0~ = 6,7 dB.

Perfect Power Control has been assumed and the up-link interference has
been simulated using a Monte-Carlo approach with 1000 snapshots.

### 6.4.2 Simulation Assumptions

The simulation assumptions used in this contribution are presented below
in Table 6.7.

In is important to highlight that Operator A has an unloaded network and
hence the additional interference caused by the UEs ACIR on Operator
B\'s up-link is not included in the simulations.

Furthermore, the downlink is not considered and hence the possibility
that UE\'s are dropped on the downlink due to ACIR from the repeater has
not been considered..

### 6.4.3 Results

The results from the simulations are shown in Fig. 6.8 as cumulative
distribution functions of the power received at Operator B\'s base
station.

We find that there are some differences between the co-ordinated and
uncoordinated scenarios. The simulations indicate the co-ordinated
scenario gives a received power, which on average is about 5 dB greater
than the uncoordinated.

From Fig. 6.8 we find that the received power is less than -110 dBm at
the 99% level for the uncoordinated scenario. The corresponding value
for the co-ordinated scenario is -107 dBm.

Figure 6.8: Cumulative distribution function of the received signal
strength at operator Bs base station due to the repeaters out of band
gain.

Figure 6.8 shows results for both uncoordinated and co-ordinated
scenario. The 99% level is -110 dBm and -107 dBm for the uncoordinated
and co-ordinated scenario, respectively.

### 6.4.4 Conclusion

In the simulations a noise increase of 5 dB due to load was assumed.
With the resulting noise level at the base station receiver the
additional interference caused by the repeaters out of band gain is 0,3
dB in the uncoordinated scenario and 0,5 dB in the co-ordinated scenario
(at the 99% level).

The simulations further indicate that the repeaters out of band gain
have a negligible impact on the receiver sensitivity at a 95 % level,
this holds true in both investigated scenarios.

6.5 Repeater ACRR system impact simulations
-------------------------------------------

### 6.5.1 General

This section analyses an up-link and down-link co-existence scenario
between a UTRA repeaters and UTRA services at adjacent channels.
Simulations are performed to analyse the effect of the interference
generated by the repeater\'s adjacent channel rejection ratio on
services at adjacent channel.

Operator A has repeaters deployed (1 per cell) and operator B is using
the adjacent cannel to operator A . Two scenarios are studied, One where
the closest distance between operator B's BS and operator A's repeaters
is 288 m, and one where it is 164 m. Both operators have a 3-sector cell
planning with 65° antennas.

### 6.5.2 Simulation Description

### 6.5.2.1 Infrastructure

Two operators have each 24 cells serviced from 8 sites situated as
depicted in figure 6.9.

![](media/image16.png){width="5.763194444444444in"
height="4.322222222222222in"}

Figure 6.9: Infrastructure scenario. Operator A (blue) uses repeaters (+
positions). Operator B (red) does not use repeaters. Black arrows show
repeater antenna directions. Yellow shade indicate service antenna.

The distance closest between operator A base stations and operator B
base stations is 288 m. Cell centre distances is 1 km for each operator.

Operator A uses one repeater per cell. Operator B uses no repeater. The
repeaters are placed in the cell centre positions 577 m away from the
donor base stations. The distance between the repeaters and operator B
base stations is 288 m and 764m respectively. The interference between
operators is investigated with different repeater settings with respect
to adjacent channel rejection ratio..

### 6.5.2.2 Preparation

For each snapshot, 960 subscribers per operator (average 40 per cell)
are randomly placed with even distribution in the infrastructure.

The coupling loss (CL) between all subscribers and all infrastructure
elements is calculated. The CL model for this is the Macro cell
propagation model as described in \[1\] MCL of 70 dB is applied. During
the CL calculation, the subscribers are mirrored on all fringe areas and
the minimum CL to each element is considered the actual, creating 100%
wrap around.

The coupling loss between all repeaters and all base stations is
calculated using the free space model.

The antenna models used are measured azimuth patterns for a 65 degree
antenna (base station antenna and repeater service antenna) and for a 33
degree antenna (repeater donor antenna). The antenna gain is 16.6 dBi
and 20 dBi respectively.

The repeater gain is set using a noise margin (i.e related to the CL
between donor BS and repeater donor port). Adjacent channel gain is
calculated for the simulated ACRR.

The coupling loss from each UE via each repeater to each BS is
calculated. (for both systems)

### 6.5.2.3 Connection

The lowest CL from each UE to any BS is considered the path of
connection to the network. If there is a path to another BS with a CL
within the soft handover margin ,it is also added as a connection path.

The power control is regulated to overcome the coupling loss in the
connected path and to meet the SIR target taking the local interference
at each element position into concern.

The coupling loss for paths not representing connection is used to
calculate interference.

### 6.5.2.4 Iterations

Interference is calculated separately for the following interference
mechanisms:

Operator A UL:

\- Noise rise (due to traffic in each cell)

\- Own subscribers in other cells

\- ACLR from B subscribers reaching the BS directly and via repeaters

\- Signals from the B subscribers affecting the BS through the ACS
(directly and via the repeater adjacent channel gain)

\- The noise generated by the repeater (NF).

Operator A DL:

\- Own cell interference (using orthogonality factor)

\- Own interference from other cells

\- Signals from B BS affecting the UE ACS (direct path and via repeaters
adjacent channel gain)

\- ACLR from B BS reaching the UE (direct path and via repeaters)

\- BS B adjacent channel noise reaching the UE (direct path and via
repeaters)

\- Noise generated by the repeaters (NF)

Operator B UL:

\- Noise rise (due to traffic in each cell)

\- Own subscribers in other cells

\- ACLR from A subscribers reaching the BS (directly and via repeaters
adjacent channel gain)

\- Signals from the A subscribers affecting the BS through the ACS
(directly and via the repeaters)

\- The noise generated by the repeaters (NF).

\- The own UE signals amplified (and distorted) by the repeater adjacent
channel gain

Operator B DL:

\- Own cell interference (using orthogonality factor)

\- Own interference from other cells

\- Signals from A BS affecting the UE ACS (direct path and via
repeaters)

\- ACLR from A BS reaching the UE (direct path and via repeater adjacent
channel gain)

\- BS A adjacent channel noise reaching the UE (direct path and via
repeater adjacent channel gain)

\- Noise generated by the repeaters (NF)

\- The own BS signals amplified (and distorted) by the rpeater adjacent
channel gain)

(descriptions of the interference mechanisms are detailed in \[2\].)

The all interference mechanisms for each link are added to form the
total interference used in the power control.

The output power and interference for each element is updated
iteratively until the difference in all interference mechanisms for each
element is less than the balance criterion between two consecutive
iterations. During the iterations the following may happen:

\- If a UE output power exceeds Pmax\_UE , it is disconnected and the
call dropped.

\- If a UE connection requires more BS power than
max\_DL\_power\_per\_sub the UE is disconnected and the call dropped.

\- If a BS power exceeds Pmax\_BS, the UE requiring most power from that
BS will be disconnected. If this UE is not in SHO the call will be
dropped, otherwise the UE will be connected only to the other BS.

\- If the repeater power exceeds Pmax\_RepA in either UL or DL, the gain
is reduced so that the repeater is not saturated. New coupling loss
through the repeater is calculated and new connections are made to be
used for the following iterations. The repeater gain is the same for UL
and DL in each repeater. A saturated repeater increases its gain when
possible due to the input power. (I.e. disconnection of UE may reduce
the power allowing more gain.)

For each snapshot, up to nine repeater settings are run with the same UE
distribution in order to compare direct performance differences.

The number of dropped calls in UL and DL, UE power, BS power UL
interference , DL interference and number of UE in SHO for each repeater
setting are saved after each snapshot.

After the number of snapshots is completed, the median values are taken
for all snapshots of respective parameter.

The ACRR definition used in these simulations is the integrated power
amplification over the adjacent channel. This definition differs from
the out of band gain requirement, currently used where a more narrow
bandwidth is used, and peak gain is limited by a mask. Sample
measurements made by Allgon indicate that there is a difference of
approximately 10 dB between the peak gain due to side band ripple and
the integrated power amplification.

### 6.5.4 Conclusions

The results show an increasingly negative impact on the network
performance in the adjacent channel when the ACRR is lower than 20 dB.
Operator B experiences negligible impact for ACRR = 30 dB or more.

The impact seems to be local around RF sources (Repeaters and Base
Stations), mainly in the down link. The results are very similar for the
two repeater positions.

### 6.5.5 Comments

Since filters are linear devices, the capability of modern 3G receivers
to interpret the signal may not be hampered as much as previously
assumed by the filter flanks.
