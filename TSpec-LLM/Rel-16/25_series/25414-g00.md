4.1 ATM Transport Option
------------------------

ATM shall be used in the transport network user plane and the transport
network control plane according to ITU-T Recommendation I.361 \[1\]. The
structure of the cell header used in the UTRAN Iu interface is the cell
header format and encoding at NNI (see figure 3/I.361).

4.2 IP Transport Option
-----------------------

An RNC/CN-node supporting IP transport option on the Iu interface shall
support PPP protocol with HDLC framing (IETF RFC 1661 \[25\], IETF RFC
1662 \[26\]).

NOTE: This does not preclude the single implementation and use of any
other protocols (e.g. PPPMux /AAL5/ ATM (IETF RFC 3153 \[32\], IETF RFC
2364 \[33\]), PPP/AAL2/ATM, Ethernet, MPLS/ATM (IETF RFC 3031 \[34\]),
etc.) fulfilling the UTRAN requirements toward the upper layers.

An RNC/CN-node supporting IP transport option on the Iu interface and
having interfaces connected via low bandwidth PPP links like E1/T1/J1
shall also support IP Header Compression (IETF RFC 2507 \[27\]) and the
PPP extensions ML/MC-PPP (IETF RFC 1990 \[28\], IETF RFC 2686 \[29\]).
In this case the negotiation of header compression (IETF RFC 2507
\[27\]) over PPP shall be performed via IETF RFC 2509 \[30\].

5 Circuit switched domain
=========================

5.1 Transport network user plane
--------------------------------

### 5.1.1 General

There are two options for the transport layer for data streams over
Iu-CS:

1\) ATM based Transport (ATM transport option)

2\) IP based Transport (IP transport option)

The following figure shows the protocol stacks of the two options.

Figure 1. Transport network layer for data streams over Iu-CS.

### 5.1.2 ATM Transport Option

#### 5.1.2.1 ATM Adaptation Layer 2

##### 5.1.2.1.1 AAL2-Segmentation and Reassembly Service Specific Convergence Sublayer (I.366.1)

Service Specific Segmentation and Reassembly (SSSAR) sublayer of ITU-T
Recommendation I.366.1 \[4\] is used for the segmentation and reassembly
of AAL2 SDUs (i.e., only SSSAR is used from ITU-T Recommendation
I.366.1).

##### 5.1.2.1.2 AAL2-specification (I.363.2)

AAL2 shall be used according to ITU-T Recommendation I.363.2 \[2\].

### 5.1.3 IP Transport Option

#### 5.1.3.1 General

In the IP transport option RTP over UDP over IP shall be supported as
the transport for data streams on the Iu-CS interface. The data link
layer is as specified in subclause 4.2.

The transport bearer is identified by the UDP port number and the IP
address (source UDP port number, destination UDP port number, source IP
address, destination IP address).

The source IP address and destination IP address exchanged via RANAP on
the Iu-CS interface shall use the NSAP structure. See sub clause 6.1.8.2
in TS 25.401 \[36\].

#### 5.1.3.2 UDP/IP

The path protocol used shall be UDP (IETF RFC 768 \[12\]).

An IP RNC/CN-node shall support IPv6. The support of IPv4 is optional.

NOTE: This does not preclude single implementation and use of IPv4.

IP dual stack support is recommended for the potential transition period
from IPv4 to IPv6 in the transport network.

There may be one or several IP addresses in the RNC and in the CN. The
packet processing function in the CN shall send downstream packets of a
given RAB to the RNC IP address / UDP port (received in RANAP)
associated to that particular RAB. The packet processing function in the
RNC shall send upstream packets of a given RAB to the CN IP address /
UDP port (received in RANAP) associated to that particular RAB. If there
is no RNC IP address / UDP port yet associated to the packet processing
function in the CN for a RAB not yet finally set-up, the packet
processing function in the CN for that RAB shall extract the source IP
address / UDP port from the first received IP packet to identify the
peer IP/UDP entity. The packet processing function in the RNC shall use
the same source IP address / UDP port as is sent to CN in RANAP.

The RNC/CN-node shall use two consecutive port numbers for the RTP
bearer and for the optional RTCP connection that transport a single Iu
UP connection. Two such consecutive port numbers are termed "port number
block" in what follows. The first port number shall be even and shall be
assigned to the RTP protocol. The next port number shall be assigned to
the RTCP protocol. This port shall be reserved even if the optional RTCP
protocol is not used.

Each RNC/CN-node shall administer the port numbers it intends to use for
RTP/RTCP port number blocks.

#### 5.1.3.3 RTP

RTP (IETF RFC 1889 \[22\]) shall be applied.

##### 5.1.3.3.1 RTP Header

The RTP Header Fields shall be used as described in the following
subclauses:

##### 5.1.3.3.1.1 Version {#version .H6}

RTP Version 2 shall be used.

##### 5.1.3.3.1.2 Padding {#padding .H6}

Padding shall not be used.

##### 5.1.3.3.1.3 Extension {#extension .H6}

The RTP Header shall not have an extension.

###### 5.1.3.3.1.4 Contributing Source (CSRC) count

There are zero CSRCs.

###### 5.1.3.3.1.5 Marker Bit

The marker bit is ignored.

###### 5.1.3.3.1.6 Payload Type

A dynamic Payload Type (IETF RFC 1890 \[23\]) shall be used. Values in
the Range between 96 and 127 shall be used. The value shall be ignored
in the receiving entity.

###### 5.1.3.3.1.7 Sequence Number

The sequence number shall be supplied by the source of an RTP PDU. The
sink of an RTP PDU may ignore the sequence number or it may use it to
obtain statistics about the link quality and / or to correct
out-of-sequence delivery, e.g. by dropping out-of-sequence packets.

###### 5.1.3.3.1.8 Timestamp

The timestamp shall be supplied by the source of an RTP PDU. A clock
frequency of 16000 Hz shall be used. The sink of an RTP PDU may ignore
the timestamp or it may use it to obtain statistics about the link
quality and / or to correct jitter.

###### 5.1.3.3.1.9 Synchronisation Source (SSRC)

The source of an RTP PDU shall supply a SSRC. The sink of an RTP PDU may
ignore the SSRC if it does not use RTCP.

###### 5.1.3.3.1.10 CSRC list

This list is empty.

##### 5.1.3.3.2 RTP Payload

A single Iu UP PDU, as described in TS 25.415 \[24\], shall be
transported as RTP payload.

#### 5.1.3.4 RTCP

RTCP (IETF RFC 1889 \[22\]) may be applied. RTCP over UDP (IETF RFC 768
\[12\]) over IPv6 (IETF RFC 2460 \[16\]) shall be used (IPv4 (IETF RFC
791 \[13\]) may be used optionally). The use of the RTCP protocol is
optional. The receiving entity may ignore incoming RTCP PDUs.

Figure 1a shows the protocol stack for the transport of RTCP. The above
Sections about IP and UDP shall also apply for the transport of RTCP.

| *IPv4 optional (RFC 791)* |
+---------------------------+

Figure 1a. RTCP Protocol stack for data stream transport on Iu-CS.

#### 5.1.3.5 Diffserv code point marking

IP Differentiated Services code point marking (IETF RFC 2474 \[19\])
shall be supported. The mapping between traffic categories and Diffserv
code points shall be configurable by O&M for each traffic category.
Traffic categories are implementation-specific and may be determined
from the application parameters.

5.2 Transport network control plane
-----------------------------------

### 5.2.1 General

The following figure shows the protocol stack for transport signalling
over Iu-CS in ATM based transport (ATM transport option). An ALCAP
protocol is not required when both UTRAN and CN nodes are using the IP
based transport (IP transport option).

The protocol stack for IP-ALCAP in IP to ATM interworking case is
defined in chapter 5.3.3 of this Technical Specification.

Figure 2. Signalling bearer for ALCAP on Iu-CS interface.

### 5.2.2 Transport Signalling for the ATM Transport Option

#### 5.2.2.1 Signalling protocol (ALCAP)

##### 5.2.2.1.1 AAL2 Signalling Protocol (Q.2630.2)

In the ATM transport option ITU-T Recommendation Q.2630.2 \[21\] shall
be used for establishing AAL2 connections towards the circuit switched
domain. ITU-T Recommendation Q.2630.2 \[21\] adds new optional
capabilities to ITU-T Recommendation Q.2630.1 \[10\].

The AAL2 transport layer uses the embedded E.164 or other AESA variants
of the NSAP addressing formats ITU-T Rec. X.213 \[11\], and ITU-T
Recommendation E.191 \[35\]. Native E.164 addressing (ITU-T
Recommendation E.164 \[5\]) shall not be used.

Binding ID provided by the radio network layer shall be copied in SUGR
parameter of ESTABLISH request primitive of ITU-T Recommendation
Q.2630.2 \[21\].

The Link Characteristics parameter (LC) shall be included in the
Establish Request message and in the Modification Request message of
AAL2 signalling protocol.

#### 5.2.2.2 Signalling transport converter

##### 5.2.2.2.1 AAL2 MTP3B Signalling Transport Converter (Q.2150.1)

The AAL2 MTP3b Signalling Transport Converter shall be used according to
ITU-T Recommendation Q.2150.1 \[8\].

#### 5.2.2.3 MTP3b (Q.2210)

MTP3b shall be used according to ITU-T Recommendation Q.2210 \[9\] and
ITU-T Implementor\'s guide (12/99) for recommendation Q.2210 \[20\].

#### 5.2.2.4 SSCF-NNI (Q.2140)

SSCF-NNI shall be used according to ITU-T Recommendation Q.2140 \[7\].

#### 5.2.2.5 SSCOP (Q.2110)

SSCOP shall be used according to ITU-T Recommendation Q.2110 \[6\].

#### 5.2.2.6 ATM Adaptation Layer Type 5 (I.363.5)

AAL5 shall be used according to ITU-T Recommendation I.363.5 \[3\].

5.3 Interworking between ATM and IP Transport Options
-----------------------------------------------------

### 5.3.1 Introduction

This clause specifies the interworking between IP and ATM transport
options. An RNC/CN-node supporting IP transport option shall provide
interworking to a CN-node/RNC supporting only ATM transport option.

### 5.3.2 Interworking Alternatives

For interworking with a CN-node/RNC supporting only ATM transport
option, the RNC/CN-node supporting IP transport option shall
additionally support at least one of the following interworking
mechanisms:

1\) ATM&IP dual stack. An IP-ALCAP protocol is not required in this
interworking solution.

Annex A of this technical specification shows an example of protocols
for the case the ATM&IP RNC/CN-node has no ATM connectivity.

2\) An Interworking Function (IWF), either internal or external to the
RNC/CN node.

Annex A of this technical specification shows an example of a protocol
stack for the case when the IWF is an external unit to the RNC/CN node.
Other protocol stacks for this case are not precluded.

6 Packet switched domain
========================

6.1 Transport network user plane
--------------------------------

### 6.1.1 General

There are two options for the transport layer for data streams over
Iu-PS:

1\) ATM based Transport (ATM transport option)

2\) IP based Transport (IP transport option)

The following figure shows the protocol stacks of the two options.

Figure 3. Transport network layer for data streams over Iu-PS.

### 6.1.2 ATM Transport Option

#### 6.1.2.1 General

In the ATM transport option, the protocol architecture for the User
Plane of the Iu interface towards the packet switched domain shall be
GTP-U (TS 29.060 \[17\]) over UDP over IP over AAL5 over ATM. One or
several AAL5/ATM permanent VC\'s may be used as the common layer 2
resources between the UTRAN and the packet switched domain of the CN.

One switched VC may be used per user flow. The standardisation of the
procedures and protocols for use of Switched VC is outside the scope of
3GPP.

Congestion control shall be performed over the Iu user plane toward the
packet switched domain using buffer management and no flow control.

#### 6.1.2.2 GTP-U

The GTP-U (TS 29.060 \[17\]) protocol shall be used over the Iu
interface toward the packet switched domain.

#### 6.1.2.3 UDP /IP

The path protocol used shall be UDP (IETF RFC 768 \[12\]), which is
specified in RFC 768.

The UDP port number for GTP-U shall be as defined in TS 29.060 \[17\].

IPv4 (IETF RFC 791 \[13\]) shall be supported; IPv6 (IETF RFC 2460
\[16\]) support is optional.

There may be one or several IP addresses in the RNC and in the CN. The
packet processing function in the CN shall send downstream packets of a
given RAB to the RNC IP address (received in RANAP) associated to that
particular RAB. The packet processing function in the RNC shall send
upstream packets of a given RAB to the CN IP address (received in RANAP)
associated to that particular RAB.

There is one RNC IP address per RNC in the CN associated with one MBMS
RAB. This address is received in RANAP at the establishment of the MBMS
RAB. The packet processing function in the CN shall send the downstream
packets of the MBMS RAB to this associated RNC IP address.

#### 6.1.2.4 ATM Adaptation Layer Type 5 (I.363.5)

AAL5 shall be used according to ITU-T Recommendation I.363.5 \[3\].

AAL5 virtual circuits shall be used to transport the IP packets across
the Iu interface toward the packet switched domain. Multiple VCs may be
used over the interface. An association shall be made between a VC and
the IP addresses that are related to this VC in the peer node side. This
association shall be made using O&M or using \"ATM Inverse ARP\" when
PVCs are used.

When PVCs are used, quality of service differentiation shall only be
performed at the IP layer using differentiated services (IETF RFC 2474
\[19\]).

#### 6.1.2.5 IP/ATM

When the association mentioned in 6.1.2.4 is made using 0&M, the \"LLC
encapsulation\" option of \"Multiprotocol Encapsulation over AAL5\"
shall be used to carry the IP packets over the ATM transport network
when PVCs are used.

When the association mentioned in 6.1.2.4 is made using \"ATM Inverse
ARP\", \"Classical IP and ARP\" over ATM protocols and the \"LLC
encapsulation\" option of \"Multiprotocol Encapsulation over AAL5\"
shall be used to carry the IP packets over the ATM transport network
when PVCs are used. \"Classical IP and ARP over ATM\" is specified in
IETF RFC 2225 \[15\]. \"Multiprotocol Encapsulation over AAL5\" is
specified in IETF RFC 2684 \[14\].

\"Classical IP and ARP over ATM\" allows routers to be members of one or
more LISs. The CN side of the Iu interface shall provide IP routing
functionalities. The RNC side of the Iu interface may provide routing
functionalities. If the RNC side of the Iu interface does not provide
routing functionalities, the RNC routing tables shall include default
route entries.

### 6.1.3 IP Transport Option

#### 6.1.3.1 General

In the IP transport option GTP-U (TS 29.060 \[17\]) over UDP over IP
shall be supported as the transport for data streams on the Iu-PS
interface. The data link layer is as specified in subclause 4.2.

The transport bearer is identified by the GTP-U TEID (TS 29.060 \[17\])
and the IP address (source TEID, destination TEID, source IP address,
destination IP address).

#### 6.1.3.2 GTP-U

The GTP-U (TS 29.060 \[17\]) protocol shall be used over the Iu
interface toward the packet switched domain.

#### 6.1.3.3 UDP /IP

The path protocol used shall be UDP (IETF RFC 768 \[12\]).

The UDP port number for GTP-U shall be as defined in TS 29.060 \[17\].

An IP RNC/CN-node shall support IPv6. The support of IPv4 is optional.

NOTE: This does not preclude single implementation and use of IPv4.

IP dual stack support is recommended for the potential transition period
from IPv4 to IPv6 in the transport network.

RNC shall support fragmentation and assembly of GTP packets at the IP
layer.

There may be one or several IP addresses in the RNC and in the CN. The
packet processing function in the CN shall send downstream packets of a
given RAB to the RNC IP address (received in RANAP) associated to that
particular RAB. The packet processing function in the RNC shall send
upstream packets of a given RAB to the CN IP address (received in RANAP)
associated to that particular RAB.

There is one RNC IP address per RNC in the CN associated with one MBMS
RAB. This address is received in RANAP at the establishment of the MBMS
RAB. The packet processing function in the CN shall send the downstream
packets of the MBMS RAB to this associated RNC IP address.

#### 6.1.3.4 Diffserv code point marking

IP Differentiated Services code point marking (IETF RFC 2474 \[19\])
shall be supported. The mapping between traffic categories and Diffserv
code points shall be configurable by O&M for each traffic category.
Traffic categories are implementation-specific and may be determined
from the application parameters.

6.2 Transport network control plane
-----------------------------------

ALCAP is not required over the Iu interface towards the packet switched
domain.

7 Broadcast Domain
==================

7.1 Transport network user plane
--------------------------------

### 7.1.1 General

There are two options for the transport layer for data streams over
Iu-BC:

1\) ATM based Transport (ATM transport option)

2\) IP based Transport (IP transport option)

The following figure shows the protocol stacks of the two options.

Figure 4. Transport network layer for data streams over Iu-BC.

### 7.1.2 ATM Transport Option

#### 7.1.2.1 General

In the ATM transport option, the protocol architecture for the Service
Area Broadcast Plane of the Iu interface shall be TCP over IP over AAL5
over ATM.

#### 7.1.2.2 TCP/IP

The path protocol used shall be TCP, which is specified in IETF RFC793
\[18\]. IPv4 (IETF RFC 791 \[13\]) shall be supported, IPv6 (IETF RFC
2460 \[16\]) support is optional.

The TCP Destination Port number for SABP messages is 3452. It is the
registered port number for SABP.

The 3452 destination port number shall be used by both entities (RNC or
CN) whenever it sets up a new TCP connection. When it sends SABP
messages on an existing TCP connection, the sending entity (RNC or CN)
shall use as TCP destination port number either 3452 if it was the
initiator of this TCP connection, or the TCP source port number that was
received from the peer entity that had initiated this existing TCP
connection.

#### 7.1.2.3 ATM Adaptation Layer Type 5 (I.363.5)

AAL5 shall be used according to ITU-T Recommendation I.363.5.

AAL5 virtual circuits shall be used to transport the IP packets across
the Iu interface toward the broadcast domain. Multiple VCs may be used
over the interface. An association shall be made between a VC and the IP
addresses that are related to this VC in the peer node side. This
association shall be made using O&M or using ATM Inverse ARP according
to Classical IP over ATM when PVCs are used.

#### 7.1.2.4 IP/ATM

When the association mentioned in 7.1.2.3 is made using O&M, the \"LLC
encapsulation\" option of \"Multiprotocol Encapsulation over AAL5\"
shall be used to carry the IP packets over the ATM transport network
when PVCs are used.

When the association mentioned in 7.1.2.3 is made using \"ATM Inverse
ARP\", \"Classical IP and ARP over ATM\" protocols and the \"LLC
encapsulation\" option of \"Multiprotocol Encapsulation over AAL5\"
shall be used to carry the IP packets over the ATM transport network
when PVCs are used. \"Classical IP and ARP over ATM\" is specified in
IETF RFC 2225 \[15\]. \"Multiprotocol Encapsulation over AAL5\" is
specified in IETF RFC 2684 \[14\].

transport for data streams on the Iu-BC interface. The data link layer
is as specified in subclause 4.2.

The transport bearer is identified by the TCP port number and the IP
address (source TCP port number, destination TCP port number, source IP
address, destination IP address).

#### 7.1.3.3 TCP /IP

The path protocol used shall be TCP, which is specified in IETF RFC 793
\[18\].

The TCP Destination Port number for SABP messages is 3452. It is the
registered port number for SABP.

The 3452 destination port number shall be used by both entities (RNC or
CN) whenever it sets up a new TCP connection. When it sends SABP
messages on an existing TCP connection, the sending entity (RNC or CN)
shall use as TCP destination port number either 3452 if it was the
initiator of this TCP connection, or the TCP source port number that was
received from the peer entity that had initiated this existing TCP
connection.

An IP RNC/CN-node shall support IPv6. The support of IPv4 is optional.

NOTE: This does not preclude single implementation and use of IPv4.

IP dual stack support is recommended for the potential transition period
from IPv4 to IPv6 in the transport network.

######## Annex A (informative): IP-ATM Interworking

A.1 Application of IP tunnelling in IP-ATM interworking alternative 1 in case of no direct ATM connectivity at the IP&ATM dual stack RNC/CN-node
================================================================================================================================================

One possibility of enabling ATM connectivity to the IP&ATM dual stack
RNC/CN-node in the IP-ATM interworking alternative 1 scenario specified
in chapter 5.3.2 is to use any ATM emulation over IP protocol from the
IETF standards e.g. via tunnelling techniques.

A.2 Application of IP-ALCAP in IP-ATM interworking alternative 2
================================================================

One example scenario of IP-ATM interworking alternative 2 of section
5.3.2 is to use IP-ALCAP as specified in ITU-T Recommendation Q.2631.1
(10/2003) as the bearer control protocol between the RNC/CN Node and its
external IWF. The following figure shows the corresponding protocol
stack.
