3 Definitions, symbols and abbreviations
========================================

3.1 Definitions
---------------

For the purpose of the present document the following terms and
definitions apply.

The main general definitions strictly related to the transmission and
reception characteristics but important also for the present document
can be found in \[3\] for UE FDD, in \[4\] for BS FDD, in \[5\] for UE
TDD, in \[6\] for BS TDD.

**Node B:** A logical node responsible for radio transmission /
reception in one or more cells to/from the User Equipment. Terminates
the Iub interface towards the RNC.

**Power Spectral Density:** The units of Power Spectral Density (PSD)
are extensively used in this document. PSD is a function of power versus
frequency and when integrated across a given bandwidth, the function
represents the mean power in such a bandwidth. When the mean power is
normalised to (divided by) the chip-rate it represents the mean energy
per chip. Some signals are directly defined in terms of energy per chip,
(DPCH\_E~c~, E~c~, OCNS\_E~c~ and P-CCPCH\_E~c~) and others defined in
terms of PSD (I~o~, I~oc~, I~or~ and Î~or~). There also exist quantities
that are a ratio of energy per chip to PSD (DPCH\_E~c~/I~or~, E~c~/I~or~
etc.). This is the common practice of relating energy magnitudes in
communication systems.\
It can be seen that if both energy magnitudes in the ratio are divided
by time, the ratio is converted from an energy ratio to a power ratio,
which is more useful from a measurement point of view. It follows that
an energy per chip of X dBm/3.84 MHz (3.84 Mcps TDD option) or X
dBm/1.28 MHz (1.28 Mcps TDD option) can be expressed as a mean power per
chip of X dBm. Similarly, a signal PSD of Y dBm/3.84 MHz (3.84 Mcps TDD
option) or Y dBm/1.28 MHz (1.28 Mcps TDD option) can be expressed as a
signal power of Y dBm.

**MBSFN cluster:** Set of cells operating in MBSFN mode providing only
MBMS service in PtM mode and seen as one cell by a UE.

The following two definitions are applicable for LCR TDD multi-frequency
operation.

**Intra-frequency cell:** In idle, CELL-FACH, CELL-PCH and URA-PCH
state, intra-frequency cell is defined as the cell of which the primary
frequency is the same as the user's current frequency. In CELL-DCH
state, intra-frequency cell is defined as the cell of which the
frequency to be measured in that cell is the same as the operating
frequency for single carrier operation or is the same as the associated
DPCH operating frequency for multi-carrier operation when DPCH is
configured, or is the same as the associated E-RUCCH operating frequency
for multi-carrier operation when DPCH is not configured.

**Inter-frequency cell:** In idle, CELL-FACH, CELL-PCH and URA-PCH
state, inter-frequency cell is defined as the cell of which the primary
frequency is different from the user's current frequency. In CELL-DCH
state, inter-frequency cell is defined as the cell of which the
frequency to be measured in that cell is different from the operating
frequency for single carrier operation or is different from the
associated DPCH operating frequency for multi-carrier operation when
DPCH is configured, or is different from the associated E-RUCCH
operating frequency for multi-carrier operation when DPCH is not
configured.

4.1 Cell Selection
------------------

### 4.1.1 Introduction

After a UE has switched on and a PLMN has been selected, the Cell
selection process takes place, as described in \[18\]. This process
allows the UE to select a suitable cell where to camp on in order to
access available services. In this process the UE can use stored
information (*Stored information cell selection*) or not (*Initial cell
selection*).

4.2 Cell Re-selection
---------------------

### 4.2.1 Introduction

#### 4.2.1.1 3.84 Mcps TDD option

The cell reselection procedure allows the UE to select a more suitable
cell and camp on it.

When the UE is in either *Camped Normally state or Camped* *on Any Cell*
state on a TDD cell, the UE shall attempt to identify, synchronise and
monitor intra-frequency, inter-frequency and inter-RAT cells indicated
in the measurement control system information of the serving cell. UE
measurement activity is also controlled by measurement rules defined in
\[18\], allowing the UE to limit its measurement activity if certain
conditions are fullfilled.

#### 4.2.1.2 1.28 Mcps TDD option

The cell reselection procedure allows the UE to select a more suitable
cell and camp on it.

When the UE is in either *Camped Normally state or Camped* *on Any Cell*
state on a TDD cell, the UE shall attempt to identify, synchronise and
monitor intra-frequency, inter-frequency and inter-RAT cells indicated
in the measurement control system information of the serving cell. UE
measurement activity is also controlled by measurement rules defined in
\[18\], allowing the UE to limit its measurement activity if certain
conditions are fullfilled.

#### 4.2.1.3 7.68 Mcps TDD option

The cell reselection procedure allows the UE to select a more suitable
cell and camp on it.

When the UE is in either *Camped Normally state or Camped* *on Any Cell*
state on a TDD cell, the UE shall attempt to identify, synchronise and
monitor intra-frequency, inter-frequency and inter-RAT cells indicated
in the measurement control system information of the serving cell. UE
measurement activity is also controlled by measurement rules defined in
\[18\], allowing the UE to limit its measurement activity if certain
conditions are fullfilled.

frequencies is provided in the measurement control systems information
and Srxlev~ServingCell~ \<= S~prioritysearch~, the rules defined below
apply irrespective of the priority of the inter-frequency layer.

The UE shall measure PCCPCH RSCP at least every N~TDDcarrier~ \*

than the serving cell within N~TDDcarrier~ \* T~evaluateTDD~ from the
moment the inter-frequency cell became at least 3 better ranked than the
current serving cell provided that Treselection timer is set to zero.
For non-identified inter-frequency cells, the filtering shall be such
that the UE shall be capable of evaluating that inter-frequency cell has
become better ranked than the serving cell within 30 s from the moment
the inter-frequency cell became at least 3 dB better ranked than the
current serving cell provided that Treselection timer is set to zero.

If Treselection timer has a non zero value and the inter-frequency
3.84Mcps TDD cell is better ranked than the serving cell, the UE shall

#### 4.2.2.3B 3.84 Mcps TDD to 1.28 Mcps TDD cell re-selection

This requirement in this section only applies to UEs supporting both

higher priority UTRA TDD 1.28 Mcps option cells are found by the higher
priority search, they shall be measured at least every (N~carrier~-1) \*
T~measureNTDD~. If, after detecting a cell in a higher priority search,
it is determined that reselection has not occurred then the UE is not
required to continuously measure the detected cell to evaluate the
ongoing possibility of reselection. However, the minimum measurement
filtering requirements specified later in this section shall still be
met by the UE before it makes any determination that it may stop
measuring the cell. If priority information for UTRA TDD carrier
frequencies is provided in the measurement control systems information
and Srxlev~ServingCell~ \<= S~prioritysearch~, the rules defined below
apply irrespective of the priority of the inter-frequency layer.

The UE shall measure PCCPCH RSCP at least every N~carrierNTDD~ \*
T~measureNTDD~ (see table 4.1A) for inter-frequency 1.28 Mcps TDD OPTION
cells that are identified and measured according to the measurement
rules. The parameter N~carrierNTDD~ is the number of carriers used for
1.28 Mcps TDD cells. The UE shall filter PCCPCH RSCP measurements of
each measured 1.28 Mcps TDD cell using at least 2 measurements, which
are taken so that the time difference between the measurements is at
least T~measureNTDD~/2.

The filtering of PCCPCH RSCP shall be such that the UE shall be capable

the serving cell within N~carrierNTDD~ \* T~evaluateNTDD~ from the
moment the inter-frequency cell became at least 3 better ranked than the
current serving cell provided that Treselection timer is set to zero.
For non-identified inter-frequency cells, the filtering shall be such
that the UE shall be capable of evaluating that inter-frequency cell has
become better ranked than the serving cell within 30 s from the moment
the inter-frequency cell became at least 3 dB better ranked than the
current serving cell provided that Treselection timer is set to zero.

If Treselection timer has a non zero value and the inter-frequency 1.28
Mcps TDD cell is better ranked than the serving cell, the UE shall

time. If this cell remains better ranked within this duration, then the
UE shall reselect that cell.

In the case of cell re-selection to 1.28 Mcps TDD multi-frequency

TDD 3.84 Mcps option cells at least every T~higher\_priority\_search~
where T~higher\_priority\_search~ is described in section 4.2.2. If
higher priority UTRA TDD 3.84 Mcps option cells are found by the higher
priority search, they shall be measured at least every (N~carrier~-1) \*
T~measureTDD~. If, after detecting a cell in a higher priority search,
it is determined that reselection has not occurred then the UE is not
required to continuously measure the detected cell to evaluate the
ongoing possibility of reselection. However, the minimum measurement
filtering requirements specified later in this section shall still be
met by the UE before it makes any determination that it may stop
measuring the cell. If priority information for UTRA TDD carrier
frequencies is provided in the measurement control systems information
and Srxlev~ServingCell~ \<= S~prioritysearch~, the rules defined below
apply irrespective of the priority of the inter-frequency layer.

The UE shall measure PCCPCH RSCP at least every N~TDDcarrier~ \*

cell has become better ranked than the serving cell within 30 s from the
moment the inter-frequency cell became at least 3 dB better ranked than
the current serving cell provided that Treselection timer is set to
zero.

If Treselection timer has a non zero value and the inter-frequency
3.84Mcps TDD cell is better ranked than the serving cell, the UE shall
evaluate this inter-frequency 3.84Mcps TDD cell for the Treselection
time. If this cell remains better ranked within this duration, then the

T~measureTDD~. If, after detecting a cell in a higher priority search,
it is determined that reselection has not occurred then the UE is not
required to continuously measure the detected cell to evaluate the
ongoing possibility of reselection. However, the minimum measurement
filtering requirements specified later in this section shall still be
met by the UE before it makes any determination that it may stop
measuring the cell. If priority information for UTRA TDD carrier

become better ranked than the serving cell within 30 s from the moment
the inter-frequency cell became at least 3 dB better ranked than the
current serving cell provided that Treselection timer is set to zero.

If Treselection timer has a non zero value and the inter-frequency 7.68
Mcps TDD cell is better ranked than the serving cell, the UE shall
evaluate this inter-frequency 7.68 Mcps TDD cell for the Treselection
time. If this cell remains better ranked within this duration, then the
UE shall reselect that cell.

#### 4.2.2.4 Measurement of inter-frequency FDD cells

If priority information for UTRA carrier frequencies is provided in the
measurement control systems information and Srxlev~ServingCell~ \>
S~prioritysearch~ then the UE shall search for any higher priority UTRA
FDD cells at least every T~higher\_priority\_search~ where
T~higher\_priority\_search~ is described in section 4.2.2. If higher
priority UTRA FDD cells are found by the higher priority search, they
shall be measured at least every (N~carrier~-1) \* T~measureFDD~. If,
after detecting a cell in a higher priority search, it is determined
that reselection has not occurred then the UE is not required to
continuously measure the detected cell to evaluate the ongoing
possibility of reselection. However, the minimum measurement filtering
requirements specified later in this section shall still be met by the
UE before it makes any determination that it may stop measuring the
cell. If priority information for UTRA carrier frequencies is provided
in the measurement control systems information and Srxlev~ServingCell~
\<= S~prioritysearch~, the rules defined below apply irrespective of the
priority of UTRA FDD layer.

##### 4.2.2.4.1 3.84 Mcps option

The UE shall measure the CPICH RSCP and CPICH Ec/Io of each FDD
neighbour cell indicated in the measurement control system information
of the serving cell, according to the measurement rules defined in
\[18\], at least every T~measureFDD~ (see table 4.1). The UE shall
filter CPICH RSCP measurements of each measured inter-frequency cell
using at least 2 measurements which are taken so that the time
difference between the first and last measurements used for filtering is
at least T~measureFDD~/2..

The filtering of CPICH RSCP shall be such that the UE shall be capable
of evaluating that an already identified inter-frequency cell has become
better ranked than the serving cell within N~carrierFDD~ \*
T~evaluateFDD~ from the moment the inter-frequency cell became at least
5 dB better than the current serving cell provided that Treselection
timer is set to zero. For non-identified inter-frequency cells, the
filtering shall be such that the UE shall be capable of evaluating that
inter-frequency cell has become better ranked than the serving cell
within 30 s from the moment the inter-frequency cell became at least 5
dB better than the current serving cell provided that Treselection timer
is set to zero. The parameter N~carrierFDD~ is the number of carriers
used for FDD cells.

If Treselection timer has a non zero value and the inter-frequency cell
is better ranked than the serving cell, the UE shall evaluate this
inter-frequency cell for the Treselection time. If this cell remains
better ranked within this duration, then the UE shall reselect that
cell.

The ranking of the cells shall be made according to the cell reselection
criteria specified in \[18\]. If FDD cell has been ranked as the best
cell and IE cell\_selection\_and\_reselection-quality\_measure is set to
CPICH Ec/No, then UE shall perform a second ranking of the FDD cells
using CPICH Ec/Io as the measurement quantity, before performing cell
re-selection.

##### 4.2.2.4.2 1.28 Mcps option

This requirement only applies to 1.28 Mcps UEs supporting both 1.28 Mcps
TDD OPTION and FDD.

The UE shall measure the CPICH RSCP and CPICH Ec/Io at least every
N~carrierFDD~ \* T~measureFDD~ (see table 4.1A) for inter-frequency FDD
cells that are identified and measured according to the measurement
rules. The UE shall filter CPICH RSCP measurements of each measured
inter-frequency cell using at least 2 measurements which are taken so
that the time difference between the first measurement and the last
measurement used for filtering is at least T~measureFDD~/2.

CPICH RSCP is used as basic measurement quantity for cell ranking, the
filtering of CPICH RSCP shall be such that the UE shall be capable of
evaluating that an already identified inter-frequency cell has become
better ranked than the serving cell within N~carrierFDD~ \*
T~evaluateFDD~ from the moment the inter-frequency cell became at least
5 dB better ranked than the current serving cell provided that
Treselection timer is set to zero. For non-identified inter-frequency
cells, the filtering shall be such that the UE shall be capable of
evaluating that inter-frequency cell has become better ranked than the
serving cell within 30 s from the moment the inter-frequency cell became
at least 5 dB better ranked than the current serving cell provided that
Treselection timer is set to zero. The parameter N~carrierFDD~ is the
number of carriers used for FDD cells.

If Treselection timer has a non zero value and the inter-frequency FDD
cell is better ranked than the serving cell, the UE shall evaluate this
inter-frequency FDD cell for the Treselection time. If this cell remains
better ranked within this duration, then the UE shall reselect that
cell.

The ranking of the cells shall be made according to the cell reselection
criteria specified in TS25.304. If FDD cell has been ranked as the best
cell and IE cell\_selection\_and\_reselection-quality\_measure is set to
CPICH Ec/No, then UE shall perform a second ranking of the FDD cells
using CPICH Ec/Io as the measurement quantity, before performing cell
re-selection.

##### 4.2.2.4.3 7.68 Mcps option

The UE shall measure the CPICH RSCP and CPICH Ec/Io of each FDD
neighbour cell indicated in the measurement control system information
of the serving cell, according to the measurement rules defined in
\[18\], at least every T~measureFDD~ (see table 4.1B). The UE shall
filter CPICH RSCP measurements of each measured inter-frequency cell
using at least 2 measurements which are taken so that the time
difference between the first and last measurements used for filtering is
at least T~measureFDD~/2..

The filtering of CPICH RSCP shall be such that the UE shall be capable
of evaluating that an already identified inter-frequency cell has become
better ranked than the serving cell within N~carrierFDD~ \*
T~evaluateFDD~ from the moment the inter-frequency cell became at least
5 dB better than the current serving cell provided that Treselection
timer is set to zero. For non-identified inter-frequency cells, the
filtering shall be such that the UE shall be capable of evaluating that
inter-frequency cell has become better ranked than the serving cell
within 30 s from the moment the inter-frequency cell became at least 5
dB better than the current serving cell provided that Treselection timer
is set to zero. The parameter N~carrierFDD~ is the number of carriers
used for FDD cells.

If Treselection timer has a non zero value and the inter-frequency cell
is better ranked than the serving cell, the UE shall evaluate this
inter-frequency cell for the Treselection time. If this cell remains
better ranked within this duration, then the UE shall reselect that
cell.

The ranking of the cells shall be made according to the cell reselection
criteria specified in \[18\]. If FDD cell has been ranked as the best
cell and IE cell\_selection\_and\_reselection-quality\_measure is set to
CPICH Ec/No, then UE shall perform a second ranking of the FDD cells
using CPICH Ec/Io as the measurement quantity, before performing cell
re-selection.

#### 4.2.2.5 Measurement of inter-RAT GSM cells

##### 4.2.2.5.1 3.84 Mcps option

The requirements in this subclause shall apply if the UE uses the cell
ranking algorithm for inter-RAT cell reselection \[18\].

The UE shall measure the signal level of the GSM BCCH carrier of each
GSM neighbour cell indicated in the measurement control system
information of the serving cell, according to the measurement rules
defined in \[18\], at least every T~measureGSM~ (see table 4.1). The UE
shall maintain a running average of 4 measurements for each cell. The
measurement samples for each cell shall be as far as possible uniformly
distributed over the averaging period.

If GSM measurements are required by the measurement rules in \[18\], The
UE shall attempt to verify the BSIC at least every 30 seconds for each
of the 4 strongest GSM BCCH carriers and rank the verified GSM BCCH
cells according to the cell re-selection criteria in \[18\]. If a change
of BSIC is detected for one GSM cell then that GSM BCCH carrier shall be
treated as a new GSM neighbour cell.

If the UE detects a BSIC, which is not indicated in the measurement
control system information, the UE shall not consider that GSM BCCH
carrier in cell reselection. The UE also shall not consider the GSM BCCH
carrier in cell reselection, if the UE can not demodulate the BSIC of
that GSM BCCH carrier.

If Treselection timer has a non zero value and the inter-RAT GSM cell is
better ranked than the serving cell, the UE shall evaluate this
inter-RAT GSM cell for the Treselection time. If this cell remains
better ranked within this duration, then the UE shall reselect that
cell.

##### 4.2.2.5.2 1.28 Mcps option

The requirements in this subclause shall apply if the UE uses the cell
ranking algorithm for inter-RAT cell reselection \[18\].

The UE shall measure the signal level of the GSM BCCH carrier of each
GSM neighbour cell indicated in the measurement control system
information of the serving cell, according to the measurement rules
defined in \[18\], at least every T~measureGSM~ (see table 4.1A). The UE
shall maintain a running average of 4 measurements for each cell. The
measurement samples for each cell shall be as far as possible uniformly
distributed over the averaging period.

If GSM measurements are required by the measurement rules in \[18\], the
UE shall attempt to verify the BSIC at least every 30 seconds for each
of the 4 strongest GSM BCCH carriers and rank the verified GSM BCCH
cells according to the cell re-selection criteria in \[18\]. If a change
of BSIC is detected for one GSM cell then that GSM BCCH carrier shall be
treated as a new GSM neighbour cell.

If the UE detects a BSIC, which is not indicated in the measurement
control system information, the UE shall not consider that GSM BCCH
carrier in cell reselection. The UE also shall not consider the GSM BCCH
carrier in cell reselection, if the UE can not demodulate the BSIC of
that GSM BCCH carrier.

If Treselection timer has a non zero value and the inter-RAT GSM cell is
better ranked than the serving cell, the UE shall evaluate this
inter-RAT GSM cell for the Treselection time. If this cell remains
better ranked within this duration, then the UE shall reselect that
cell.

##### 4.2.2.5.3 7.68 Mcps option

The requirements in this subclause shall apply if the UE uses the cell
ranking algorithm for inter-RAT cell reselection \[18\].

The UE shall measure the signal level of the GSM BCCH carrier of each
GSM neighbour cell indicated in the measurement control system
information of the serving cell, according to the measurement rules
defined in \[18\], at least every T~measureGSM~ (see table 4.1B). The UE
shall maintain a running average of 4 measurements for each cell. The
measurement samples for each cell shall be as far as possible uniformly
distributed over the averaging period.

If GSM measurements are required by the measurement rules in \[18\], The
UE shall attempt to verify the BSIC at least every 30 seconds for each
of the 4 strongest GSM BCCH carriers and rank the verified GSM BCCH
cells according to the cell re-selection criteria in \[18\]. If a change
of BSIC is detected for one GSM cell then that GSM BCCH carrier shall be
treated as a new GSM neighbour cell.

If the UE detects a BSIC, which is not indicated in the measurement
control system information, the UE shall not consider that GSM BCCH
carrier in cell reselection. The UE also shall not consider the GSM BCCH
carrier in cell reselection, if the UE can not demodulate the BSIC of
that GSM BCCH carrier.

If Treselection timer has a non zero value and the inter-RAT GSM cell is
better ranked than the serving cell, the UE shall evaluate this
inter-RAT GSM cell for the Treselection time. If this cell remains
better ranked within this duration, then the UE shall reselect that
cell.

##### 4.2.2.5.4 Cell reselection based on priority information

The requirements in this subclause shall apply if the UE uses the
absolute priorities based algorithm for inter-RAT cell reselection
\[18\].

If Srxlev~ServingCell~ \> S~prioritysearch~ then

\- the UE may not search for, or measure GSM cells if the priority of
GSM is lower than the serving cell.

\- the UE shall search for and measure GSM cells if the priority of GSM
is higher than the serving cell. The minimum rate at which the UE is
required to search for and measure such layers may be reduced in this
scenario to maintain UE battery life

If Srxlev~ServingCell~ \<= S~prioritysearch~ then the UE shall measure,
according to the measurement rules defined in \[18\], at least every
T~measure,GSM~ (see table 4.1, 4.1A and 4.1B):

\- if a detailed neighbour cell list is provided, the signal level of
the GSM BCCH carrier of each GSM neighbour cell indicated in the
measurement control system information of the serving cell; or

\- if only BCCH carriers are provided, the signal level of the GSM BCCH
carriers indicated in the measurement control system information of the
serving cell.

> *Note : If it is concluded that only blacklist, or only whitelist can
> be used for reselection to GSM then one of these bullets can be
> deleted.*

If Srxlev~ServingCell~ \> S~prioritysearch~ then the UE shall search for
GSM BCCH carrier at least every T~higher\_priority\_search~ where
T~higher\_priority\_search~ is described in section 4.2.2. When higher
priority GSM BCCH carriers are found by the higher priority search, they
shall be measured at least every T~measure,GSM,~ and the UE shall decode
the BSIC of the GSM BCCH carrier. If, after detecting a cell in a higher
priority search, it is determined that reselection has not occurred then
the UE is not required to continuously measure the detected cell to
evaluate the ongoing possibility of reselection to continuously verify
the BSIC of the GSM BCCH carrier every 30s. However, the minimum
measurement filtering requirements specified later in this section shall
still be met by the UE before it makes any determination that it may
stop measuring the cell. If Srxlev~ServingCell~ \<= S~prioritysearch~,
the rules defined below apply irrespective of the priority of the GSM
layer.

The UE shall maintain a running average of 4 measurements for each GSM
BCCH carrier. The measurement samples for each cell shall be as far as
possible uniformly distributed over the averaging period.

If continuous GSM measurements are required by the measurement rules in
\[18\], the UE shall attempt to verify the BSIC at least every 30
seconds for each of the 4 strongest GSM BCCH carriers. If a change of
BSIC is detected for one GSM cell then that GSM BCCH carrier shall be
treated as a new GSM neighbour cell. If the UE detects on a BCCH carrier
a BSIC which is indicated as not allowed for that carrier in the
measurement control system information of the serving cell, the UE is
not required to perform BSIC re-confirmation for that cell.

The UE shall not consider the GSM BCCH carrier in cell reselection, if
the UE cannot demodulate the BSIC of that GSM BCCH carrier.
Additionally, the UE shall not consider a GSM neighbour cell in cell
reselection, if it is indicated as not allowed in the measurement
control system information of the serving cell.

#### 4.2.2.5a Measurements of inter-RAT E-UTRA cells

The UE shall be able to identify new E-UTRA cells and perform RSRP
measurements of identified E-UTRA cells if carrier frequency information
is provided by the serving cell, even if no explicit neighbour list with
physical layer cell identities is provided.

If Srxlev~ServingCell~ \> S~prioritysearch~ then the UE shall search for
and measure E-UTRA layers of higher priority at least every
T~higher\_priority\_search~ where T~higher\_priority\_search~ is
described in section 4.2.2.. The minimum rate at which the UE is
required to search for and measure such layers may be reduced in this
scenario to maintain UE battery life.

If Srxlev~ServingCell~ \<= S~prioritysearch~ , then the UE shall search
for and measure E-UTRA frequency layers of higher or lower priority in
preparation for possible reselection. In this scenario, the minimum rate
at which the UE is required to search for and measure higher priority
layers is not reduced and shall be the same as that defined below for a
lower priority layers.

The UE shall be able to evaluate whether a new detectable lower priority
inter-RAT E-UTRA cell meets the reselection criteria defined in \[18\]
within K~carrier~ \* T~detectE-UTRA~, where T~detectE-UTRA~ is given in
Table 4.2 or 4.2A or 4.2B if at least E-UTRA carrier frequency
information is provided in the inter-RAT measurement control system
information when Treselection = 0 provided that the reselection criteria
is met by a margin of at least 6dB. The parameter K~carrier~ is the
number of E-UTRA carrier frequencies indicated in the inter-RAT
measurement control system information. An inter-RAT E-UTRAN cell is
considered to be detectable if:

\- RSRP\|~dBm~ and RSRP Ês/Iot[,]{.underline} according to Annex B.1.1
for a corresponding Band [ ]{.underline}

> \- SCH\_RP and SCH Ês/Iot, according to Annex B.1.1 for a
> corresponding Band

The UE shall measure RSRP at least every K~carrier~ \*
T~measure,EUTRA\_~as defined in table 4.2 or 4.2A or 4.2B for identified
E-UTRA cells.

When higher priority cells are found by the higher priority search, they
shall be measured at least every T~measureE-UTRA~. If, after detecting a
cell in a higher priority search, it is determined that reselection has
not occurred then the UE is not required to continuously measure the
detected cell to evaluate the ongoing possibility of reselection.
However, the minimum measurement filtering requirements specified later
in this section shall still be met by the UE before it makes any
determination that it may stop measuring the cell.

If the UE detects on a E-UTRA carrier a cell whose physical identity is
indicated as not allowed for that carrier in the measurement control
system information of the serving cell, the UE is not required to
perform measurements on that cell.

The UE shall filter RSRP measurements of each measured E-UTRA cell using
at least 2 measurements. Within the set of measurements used for the
filtering, at least two measurements shall be spaced by at least
(K~carrier~ \* T~measure,EUTRA~)/2.

RSRP measurements of E-UTRA cells shall not be filtered over a longer
period than that specified in Table 4.2 or 4.2A or 4.2B.

The UE shall not consider an E-UTRA neighbour cell in cell reselection,
if it is indicated as not allowed in the measurement control system
information of the serving cell.

For an inter-RAT E-UTRA cell that has been already detected, but that
has not been reselected to, The filtering shall be such that the UE
shall be capable of evaluating that the EUTRAN cell has met reselection
criterion defined in \[25\] within K~carrier~ \*T~evaluateEUTRA~ as
specified in table 4.2 or 4.2A or 4.2B provided that the reselection
criteria is met by a margin of at least 6dB when T~reselection~ = 0.

If T~reselection~ timer has a non zero value and an E-UTRA cell is
better ranked than the serving cell, the UE shall evaluate this E-UTRA
cell for the T~reselection~ time. If this cell remains better ranked
within this duration, then the UE shall reselect that cell.

#### 4.2.2.6 Evaluation of cell reselection criteria

##### 4.2.2.6.1 3.84 Mcps option

The UE shall evaluate the cell re-selection criteria defined in \[18\]
for the cells, which have new measurement results available, at least
once every DRX cycle.

UE shall perform cell reselection immediately after the UE has found a
better ranked suitable cell unless less than 1 second has elapsed from
the moment the UE started camping on the current serving cell.

The ranking of the cells shall be made according to the cell reselection
criteria specified in TS25.304.

##### 4.2.2.6.2 1.28 Mcps option

The UE shall evaluate the cell re-selection criteria defined in \[18\]
for the cells, which have new measurement results available, at least
every DRX cycle.

Cell reselection shall take place immediately after the UE has found a
better ranked suitable cell unless the UE has made cell reselection
within the last 1 second.

The ranking of the cells shall be made according to the cell reselection
criteria specified in TS25.304.

##### 4.2.2.6.3 7.68 Mcps option

The UE shall evaluate the cell re-selection criteria defined in \[18\]
for the cells, which have new measurement results available, at least
once every DRX cycle.

UE shall perform cell reselection immediately after the UE has found a
better ranked suitable cell unless less than 1 second has elapsed from
the moment the UE started camping on the current serving cell.

The ranking of the cells shall be made according to the cell reselection
criteria specified in TS25.304.

#### 4.2.2.7 Maximum interruption time in paging reception

##### 4.2.2.7.1 3.84 Mcps option

UE shall perform the cell re-selection with minimum interruption in
monitoring downlink channels for paging reception.

At intra-frequency cell re-selection, the UE shall monitor the downlink
of current serving cell for paging reception until the UE is capable to
start monitoring downlink channels of the target intra-frequency cell
for paging reception. The interruption time shall not exceed 50 ms.

At inter-frequency and inter-RAT cell re-selection, the UE shall monitor
the downlink of current serving cell for paging reception until the UE
is capable to start monitoring downlink channels for paging reception of
the target inter-frequency cell. For inter-frequency cell re-selection,
the interruption time shall not exceed T~SI~ + 50 ms. For inter-RAT cell
re-selection the interruption time shall not exceed T~BCCH~ + 50 ms for
GSM or T~SI\ EUTRA~ + \[50ms\] for E-UTRA.

T~SI~ is the time required for receiving all the relevant system
information data according to the reception procedure and the RRC
procedure delay of system information blocks defined in \[16\] for a
UTRAN cell.

T~BCCH~ is the maximum time allowed to read BCCH data from a GSM cell as
defined in \[21\].

T~SI-EUTRA~ is the maximum time allowed to read system information from
an E-UTRA cell \[24\].

These requirements assume sufficient radio conditions, so that decoding
of system information can be made without errors errors and does not
take into account cell re-selection failure.

In idle mode, UE shall support DRX cycles lengths 0.64, 1.28, 2.56 and
5.12 s, according to \[16\].

##### 4.2.2.7.2 1.28 Mcps option

UE shall perform the cell re-selection with minimum interruption in
monitoring downlink channels for paging reception.

At intra-frequency cell re-selection, the UE shall monitor the downlink
of current serving cell for paging reception until the UE is capable to
start monitoring downlink channels of the target intra-frequency cell
for paging reception. The interruption time shall not exceed 50 ms.

At inter-frequency and inter-RAT cell re-selection, the UE shall monitor
the downlink of current serving cell for paging reception until the UE
is capable to start monitoring downlink channels for paging reception of
the target inter-frequency cell. For inter-frequency cell re-selection
he interruption time must not exceed T~SI~ + 50 ms. For inter-Rat cell
re-selection the interruption time must not exceed T~BCCH~+50 ms for GSM
or T~SI\ EUTRA~ + \[50ms\] for E-UTRA.

T~SI~ is the time required for receiving all the relevant system
information data according to the reception procedure and the RRC
procedure delay of system information blocks defined in \[16\] for a
UTRAN cell.

T~BCCH~ is the maximum time allowed to read BCCH data from a GSM cell
\[21\].

T~SI-EUTRA~ is the maximum time allowed to read system information from
an E-UTRA cell \[24\].

These requirements assume sufficient radio conditions, so that decoding
of system information can be made without errors and does not take into
account cell re-selection failure.

Scheduled idle intervals according to the UE capability may be used to
be able to make measurements on E-UTRAN.

### 5.3a.2 Requirements

The requirements in this section shall apply to UE supporting TDD and

command, the UE shall be ready to start the transmission of the new
uplink PRACH channel at the designated activation time + interruption
time.

#### 5.3a.2.2 Interruption time

The interruption time is the time between end of the last TTI in which
the UE has received the handover command and the time the UE starts
transmission of the PRACH in the new E-UTRA cell, excluding the RRC
procedure delay. This requirement applies when UE is not required to
perform any synchronisation procedure before transmitting on the new
PRACH.

When inter-RAT handover to E-UTRAN is commanded, the interruption time
shall be less than Tinterrupt:

Tinterrupt = T~search~ + T~IU~ + 20 ms

where

> T~search~ is the time required to search the target cell when the
> target cell is not already known when the handover command is received
> by the UE. If the target cell is known, then T~search~ = 0 ms. If the
> target cell is unknown and signal quality is sufficient for successful
> cell detection on the first attempt, then T~search~ = 80 ms.
>
> T~IU~ is the interruption uncertainty in acquiring the first available
> PRACH occasion in the new cell. T~IU~ can be up to 30 ms.
>
> NOTE: The actual value of T~IU~ shall depend upon the PRACH
> configuration used in the target cell.

procedure delay. This requirement applies when UE is not required to
perform any synchronisation procedure before transmitting on the new
PRACH.

When inter-RAT handover to E-UTRAN is commanded, the interruption time
shall be less than T~interrupt~:

T~interrupt~ = T~search~ + T~IU~ + 20 ms

The UE shall continuously evaluate based on the *Elimination*,
*Recovery* and *Blocking* criteria defined below, how TFCs can be used
for the purpose of TFC selection. The evaluation shall be performed
using the estimated UE transmit power of a given CCTrCH in its
associated timeslots.

In the case of a single CCTrCH or multiple CCTrCHs having mutually
exclusive timeslot assignments, the UE shall consider the *Eliminiation*
criterion for a given TFC of a CCTrCH to be fulfilled if for 3
successive frames the estimated UE transmit power is greater than the
Maximum UE transmitter power for at least one timeslot associated with
the CCTrCH in each frame.

. In the case of multiple CCTrCHs not having mutually exclusive timeslot
assignments, if for a given CCTrCH for 3 successive frames the estimated
UE transmit power is greater than the Maximum UE transmitter power for
at least one timeslot associated with the CCTrCH in each frame, the UE
shall consider the *Elimination* criterion for a given TFC to be
fulfilled if the use of this TFC will cause the estimated UE transmit
power to continue to be greater than the Maximum UE transmitter power in
at least one timeslot associated with the CCTrCH.

In the case of multi-frame operation of UL Physical Channels, the UE
shall only consider active frames for the evaluation of the
*Elimination* criterion.

purpose of TFC selection.

MAC in the UE shall indicate the available bitrate for each logical
channel to upper layers within T~notify~ from the moment the
*Elimination* criterion was fulfilled.

fulfilled until the use of this TFC will not cause the estimated UE
transmit power to be greater than the Maximum UE transmitter power for
all UL timeslots associated with the TFC for a minimum of 3 successive
frames.

In the case of multi-frame operation of UL Physical Channels, the UE
shall only consider active frames for the evaluation of the *Recovery*
criterion.

. If the *Recovery* criterion for a given TFC is fulfilled, the MAC in
the UE shall consider that the TFC is in Supported state for the purpose
of TFC selection.

MAC in the UE shall indicate the available bitrate for each logical
channel to upper layers within T~notify~ from the moment the *Recovery*
criterion was fulfilled.

The UE shall consider the *Blocking* criterion for a given TFC to be
fulfilled at the latest at the start of the longest uplink TTI after the
moment at which the TFC will have been in Excess-Power state for a
duration of

(T~notify~ + T~modify~+ T~L1\_proc~).

7 Timing characteristics
========================

7.1 Timing Advance
------------------

### 7.1.1 3.84 Mcps TDD option

#### 7.1.1.1 Introduction

The timing advance is initiated from UTRAN with an RRC message that
implies an adjustement of the timing advance, see TS 25.331 section
8.6.6.26.

To update timing advance of a UE, the UTRAN measures RX Timing
deviation. The measurements are defined in TS 25.225 and measurement
accuracies are specified in section 9.

#### 7.1.1.2 Requirements

##### 7.1.1.2.1 Timing Advance adjustment accuracy

The UE shall adjust the timing of its transmissions with an accuracy
better than or equal to ±0.5 chip to the signalled timing advance value.

##### 7.1.1.2.2 Timing Advance adjustment delay

The UE shall adjust the timing of its transmission at the designated
activation time, when the indicated activation time is later than D~TA~
msec from the end of the last TTI containing the RRC message implying an
adjustment of the timing advance.

D~TA~ equals the RRC procedure delay of the RRC message implying an
adjustment of the timing advance as defined in TS25.331 section 13.5.

### 7.1.2 1.28 Mcps TDD option

For 1.28 Mcps TDD the timing advance in the UE is adjusted by means of
uplink synchronization. For the random access procedure the node B
commands the UE to adjust its synchronisation shift by means of
signalling the received position of the UpPTS in the FPACH. During the
connection the node B measures the timing in the uplink and transmits a
SS (Synchronization Shift) command to the UE at least once per
sub-frame.

These SS commands determined whether the UE synchronization shift is
either left unchanged, or adjusted 1 step up or 1 step down. The step
size of the SS adjustment is (k/8)Tc where k (=1,2, ...,8) is signalled
by higher layer signalling.

#### 7.1.2.1 Uplink synchronization control requirements for UE for 1.28 Mcps TDD option

Uplink synchronization control is the ability of the UE transmitter to
adjust its TX timing in accordance with one or more SS commands received
in the downlink.

##### 7.1.2.1.1 Uplink synchronization control steps

The SS step is the change in UE transmission timing in response to a
single SS command, SS\_cmd, received by the UE.

###### **7.1.2.1.1.1 Minimum requirement**

The UE transmitter shall have the capability of changing the
transmission timing with a step size of 1/8, 2/8, 3/8, ..., 1 chip
according to the value of Δ ~SS~, within n=(1,2,...,6) time slots
excluding special timeslots (DwPTS, GP, UpPTS) after the SS\_cmd arrived
(closed loop). For the open loop any step being a multiple of 1/8 chip
has to be allowed.

a\) The minimum transmission timing step Δ ~SS,min~ due to closed loop
uplink synchronization control shall be within the range shown in Table
7.1.

b\) In case uplink synchronization control implies larger adjustment
than the minimum step the UE shall perform a multiple integer number of
the minimum step. Within the implementation grid of the applicable
timing steps of the UE the step being closest to the required step
should be executed.

  --------- ------------------------------------------------------- ----------

### 7.1.3 7.68 Mcps TDD option

#### 7.1.3.1 Introduction

The timing advance is initiated from UTRAN with an RRC message that
implies an adjustement of the timing advance, see TS 25.331 section
8.6.6.26.

To update timing advance of a UE, the UTRAN measures RX Timing
deviation. The measurements are defined in TS 25.225 and measurement
accuracies are specified in section 9.

better than or equal to ±0.5 chip to the signalled timing advance value.

##### 7.1.3.2.2 Timing Advance adjustment delay

propagation condition.

7.3A UE Transmit Timing for 7.68 Mcps TDD Option
------------------------------------------------

### 7.3A.1 Definition

UE transmit timing is defined as the frame start time of uplink
transmissions relative to the downlink frame timing at zero propagation
delay with timing advance turned off. The reference point for UE
transmit timing shall be the antenna connector. This is applicable for
the AWGN propagation condition. In the case of multi-path fading
conditions, the reference point for UE transmit timing shall be the
first significant path of the received PCCPCH.

### 7.3A.2 Minimum Requirement

to Table 7.2.

The requirements are only related to the actual timing measurements
internally in the UE. They do not include the following:

\- Inaccuracy in the start and stop conditions of a timer (e.g. UE
reaction time to detect that start and stop conditions of a timer is
fulfilled), or

\- Inaccuracies due to restrictions in observability of start and stop
conditions of a UE timer (e.g. TTI alignment when UE sends messages at
timer expiry).

Void.

### 7.5.2 1.28 Mcps TDD option

#### 7.5.2.1 Uplink synchronization control for PRACH

##### 7.5.2.1.1 Introduction

The establishment of uplink synchronization is done during the random
access procedure and involves the UpPCH and the PRACH. To update timing
advance of a UE, the UTRAN measures SYNC-UL Timing deviation. Uplink
synchronization control for PRACH is used to adjust its synchronisation
shift by means of signalling the received position of the UpPTS in the
FPACH.

Time of the beginning of the PRACH T~TX‑PRACH~ is given by:

T~TX-PRACH~ = T~RX-PRACH~ -- (UpPCH~ADV~ + UpPCH~POS~ -- 8\*16 T~C~)

in multiple of 1/8 chips, where

T~TX-PRACH~ is the beginning time of PRACH transmission with the UE's
timing,

T~RX-PRACH~ is the beginning time of PRACH reception with the UE's
timing if the PRACH was a DL channel.

UpPCH~POS~ is the received SYNC-UL timing deviation measured by UTRAN.

UpPCH~ADV~ is the timing advance of SYNC-UL given by UE.

Then the timing advance for PRACH is given by:

T~ADV-PRACH~ = T~RX-PRACH~ -- T~TX-PRACH~ = (UpPCH~ADV~ + UpPCH~POS~ --
8\*16 T~C~)

The procedure and measurements are defined in TS 25.224 section 5.2.2
and section 5.2.3.

##### 7.5.2.1.2 Requirements

The uplink synchronization accuracy for PRACH is defined as PRACH timing
deviation between received PRACH position and desired PRACH position.
The accuracy requirements of uplink synchronization control for PRACH
are decided by the accuracy of UpPCH timing advance UpPCH~ADV~ measured
by UE and the accuracy of SYNC-UL timing deviation UpPCH~POS~ measured
by UTRAN, which refer to section 9.1.2.2 and section 9.2.1.10.

#### 7.5.2.2 Uplink synchronization control during handover

##### 7.5.2.2.1 Introduction

The closed loop uplink synchronisation control uses layer 1 symbols (SS
commands) for DPCH and PUSCH. After establishment of the uplink
synchronisation, NodeB and UE start to use the closed loop UL
synchronisation control procedure. This procedure is continuous during
connected mode.

During a 1.28 Mcps TDD to 1.28 Mcps TDD hand-over the UE shall transmit
in the new cell with timing advance TA adjusted by the relative timing
difference ∆t between the new and the old cell if indicated by higher
layers:

TA~new~ = TA~old~ + 2∆t.

TA~new~ is the timing advance of the new cell.

TA~old~ is the timing advance of the old cell,

∆t is the relative timing difference between the new and the old cell,
which is measured by UE as SFN-SFN observed time difference type 2.

##### 7.5.2.2.2 Requirements

The uplink synchronization accuracy during handover is defined as timing
deviation between the initial actual uplink synchronization position and
the desired position of the first uplink DPCH on the target cell. The
accuracy requirements of uplink synchronization control during handover
are decided by the accuracy of the timing advance and the accuracy of
SFN-SFN observed time difference type 2 measured by UE, which refer to
section 9.1.1.8 and section 9.1.2.2.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 8.1.1 Introduction

This section contains requirements on the UE regarding measurement
reporting in CELL\_DCH state. The requirements are split in TDD intra
frequency, TDD inter frequency, FDD and GSM measurements. These
measurements may be used by the UTRAN, e.g. for handover decisions. The
measurements are defined in \[14\], the measurement model is defined in
\[15\] and measurement accuracies are specified in section 9. Control of
measurement reporting is specified in \[16\] and parallel measurements
are specified in section 8.2. For the description of the idle intervals
see \[14\].

### 8.1.2 Requirements

#### 8.1.2.1 UE Measurement Capability

The UE shall be able to monitor up to

\- 32 intra frequency TDD cells (including serving cell), and

\- 32 inter frequency cells, including

> \- TDD mode cells distributed on up to 2 additional TDD carriers and
>
> \- Depending on UE capability, FDD mode cells, distributed on up to 3
> FDD carriers.

\- Depending on UE capability, 32 inter RAT GSM cells,

\- Depending on UE capability, 4 E-UTRA FDD cells per E-UTRA FDD carrier
for up to 4 E-UTRA FDD carriers; and

\- Depending on UE capability, 4 E-UTRA TDD cells per E-UTRA TDD carrier

For measurements on intra- and inter-frequency TDD, inter-frequency FDD
and GSM cells, idle intervals as described in \[14\] can be used. The
time T~measure~ per 480 ms period available for these measurements is
the sum of the duration of all idle intervals during any given 480 ms
period, i.e. the amount of time not used by the UE for receiving in
active DL timeslots or for transmission in active UL timeslots. Note
that Beacon timeslots of the serving cell can be located inside idle
intervals and that implementation margin due to frequency switching is
not taken into account for T~measure~.

The requirements in this section are based upon the assumption, that the
time durations T~intra~ and T~inter~ during any given 480 ms period for
the purpose of measurements on intra-frequency TDD cells and for
measurements on inter-frequency TDD, inter-frequency FDD and GSM cells
are respectively,

inter-frequency measurements.

T~FDD\ inter~ is the time duration allocated for the purpose of FDD
inter-frequency measurements.

neighbour list, equal to 0 otherwise.

N~FDD~ is equal to 1 if the UE has capability for FDD and if there are
inter-frequency FDD cells in the neighbour list, equal to 0 otherwise.

T~measurement\ period\ intra~ = 200 ms

The UE physical layer shall be capable of reporting these measurements
to higher layers with the measurement period
T~measurement\ period\ intra~.

If the UE has identified more than X~measurement\ intra~ intra-frequency
TDD cells, the UE shall perform measurements of all identified cells but

The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as long as
the reporting criteria are not fulfilled.

The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between any event
that will trigger a measurement report, until the UE starts to transmit

that the measurement report is not delayed by other RRC signalling on
the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes a delay uncertainty
resulted when inserting the measurement report to the TTI of the uplink
DCCH . The delay uncertainty is twice the TTI of the uplink DCCH.

For P-CCPCH RSCP measurements, the event triggered measurement reporting
delay, on cells belonging to the monitored set, measured without L3
filtering shall be less than T ~identify\ intra~ defined in Section
8.1.2.2.1. When L3 filtering is used an additional delay can be
expected..

If a cell, belonging to the monitored set has been detectable at least
for the time period T~identify\ intra~ and then enters the reporting
range, the event triggered P-CCPCH RSCP measurement reporting delay

measurement opportunity on a Beacon timeslot of an inter-frequency TDD
cell is provided if an idle interval of length equal to or greater than
3 timeslots less 2\*0.5 ms implementation margin for frequency switching
per idle interval completely overlaps in time with the Beacon timeslot
of the inter-frequency TDD cell.

N~basic\_identify\_TDD\ inter~ = 80. This is a number of measurement
opportunities for a Beacon timeslot of an inter-frequency TDD cell
during the time period used in the inter frequency TDD equation where
the maximum allowed time for the UE to identify a new detectable
inter-frequency TDD cell is defined.

N~basic\_measurement\_TDD\ inter~ = 5. This is a number of measurement
opportunities for a Beacon timeslot of an inter-frequency TDD cell
during the time period T~TDD\ inter~ used in the inter-frequency TDD
equation where the measurement period for inter-frequency P-CCPCH RSCP
measurements is defined.

N~Freq\ TDD~: This is the number of TDD frequencies indicated in the
inter frequency measurement control information.

Note that the number of measurement opportunities available to the UE
depends on UL and DL timeslot assignments for transmission and reception
and on Beacon timeslot allocations in the inter-frequency TDD cells.

Reported measurements in periodically triggered measurement reports
shall meet the requirements in section 9.

##### 8.1.2.3.4 Event Triggered Reporting

Reported measurements in event triggered measurement reports shall meet
the requirements in section 9.

The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as long as
the reporting criteria is not fulfilled.

The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between any event
that will trigger a measurement report, until the UE starts to transmit
the measurement report over the Uu interface. This requirement assumes
that that the measurement report is not delayed by other RRC signalling
on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes a delay

filtering shall be less than T ~identify\ inter~ defined in Section
8.1.2.3.1 When L3 filtering is used an additional delay can be expected.

If an intra frequency TDD cell has been detectable at least for the time
period T~identify\_\ inter~ and then enters the reporting range, the

T~measurement\_period\ FDD\ inter~ = 480 ms. The time period used for
calculating the measurement period T~measurement\_FDD\ inter~ for inter
frequency CPICH measurements.

T~FDD~ ~inter:\ available~: This is the available time for measurements
on inter-frequency FDD cells. T~FDD\ inter\ available~ shall be derived
from T~FDD\ inter~ by assuming 2\*0.5 ms implementation margin for
frequency switching per idle interval and by only taking into account
the remaining number of full timeslots per idle interval. Idle intervals
smaller than 3 timeslots shall not be taken into account for calculating
T~FDD\ inter\ available~.

shall meet the requirements in section 9.

##### 8.1.2.4.4 Event Triggered Reporting

Reported measurements in event triggered measurement reports shall meet
the requirements in section 9.

The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports as long as the
reporting criteria are not fulfilled.

The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between any event
that will trigger a measurement report until the UE starts to transmit
the measurement report over the Uu interface. This requirement assumes
that that the measurement report is not delayed by other RRC signalling
on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes a delay
uncertainty resulted when inserting the measurement report to the TTI of
the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertanty is twice the TTI of the uplink
DCCH.

The event triggered measurement reporting delay, measured without L3
filtering shall be less than T ~identify\ FDD\ inter~ defined in Section
8.1.2.4.1. When L3 filtering is used an additional delay can be
expected.

non-verified.

a\) In CELL\_DCH state, when signaled by UTRAN and when idle intervals
are used for GSM measurements, the UE shall continuously measure GSM
cells and search for new GSM cells given in the monitored set.

\- In section 8.1.2.1 the split of measurements between different modes
and systems is defined. Every second measurement opportunity scheduled
for GSM measurements, as given by 8.1.2.1 shall be allocated for GSM
initial BSIC identification.

\- The remaining measurements opportunities scheduled for GSM
measurements shall be used as follows. 3 measurement opportunities out
of 4 shall be allocated for GSM carrier RSSI measurements and 1 out of 4
shall be allocated for GSM BSIC reconfirmation. The scheduling of
measurement opportunities between GSM carrier RSSI measurements and GSM
BSIC reconfirmation is up to the UE.

b\) In CELL\_DCH state, when signaled by UTRAN and when the UE does not
need idle intervals to perform GSM measurements, the UE shall measure
all GSM cells present in the monitored set

\- the relevant requirements for GSM dedicated mode when a TCH channel
is assigned in \[21\] shall apply. This is further detailed in the
following sub-sections.

##### 8.1.2.5.1 GSM carrier RSSI

a\) For a UE using idle intervals to perform GSM measurements

A UE supporting GSM measurements using idle intervals shall meet the
minimum number of GSM carrier RSSI measurements specified in table 8.1.

In the CELL\_DCH state the measurement period,
T~measurement\ period\ GSM~, for the GSM carrier RSSI measurement is 480
ms.

The UE shall meet the measurement accuracy requirements stated for RXLEV
in \[21\], when the given measurement time allows the UE to the take at
least 3 GSM carrier RSSI samples per GSM carrier in the monitored set
during the measurement period.

Table 8.1

  ---------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------
  Idle interval length (timeslots)   Number of GSM carrier RSSI samples in each idle interval

  13                                 14
  ---------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------

In case the UE is not able to acquire the required number of samples per
GSM carrier during one measurement period, the UE shall measure as many
GSM carriers as possible during that measurement period using at least 3
samples per GSM carrier. The GSM carriers that were not measured during
that measurement period shall be measured in the following measurement
periods. This means that, in this particular case, the L1 reporting
period to higher layers of a GSM neighbour can be a multiple of the
measurement period.

b\) For a UE not using idle intervals to perform GSM measurements

The samples allocated to each carrier shall as far as possible be
uniformly distributed over each measurement period. At least 3 received
signal level measurement samples are required per GSM carrier RSSI
measurement. The measurement period shall be 480 ms.

##### 8.1.2.5.2 BSIC verification {#bsic-verification .list-paragraph}

a\) For a UE using idle intervals to perform GSM measurements

The procedure for BSIC verification on a GSM cell can be divided into
the following two tasks:

1\) Initial BSIC identification: Includes searching for the BSIC and
decoding the BSIC for the first time when there is no knowledge about
the relative timing between the TDD and GSM cell.. The requirements for
Initial BSIC identification can be found in section 8.1.2.5.2.1.

2\) BSIC re-confirmation: Tracking and decoding the BSIC of a GSM cell
after initial BSIC identification is performed.. The requirements for
Initial BSIC identification can be found in section 8.1.2.5.2.2.

Measurements on a GSM cell can be requested with BSIC verified or BSIC
non-verified. If GSM measurements are requested with BSIC verified, the
UE shall be able to report the GSM cells with BSIC verified for those
cells where the verification of BSIC has been successful.

If the UTRAN requests measurements on a GSM cell with BSIC verified, the
UE shall behave as follows:

\- The UE shall perform GSM carrier RSSI measurements according to
Section 8.1.2.5.1 and the UE shall perform measurement reporting as
defined in Section 8.6.7.6 of \[16\].

\- The UE shall use the last available GSM carrier RSSI measurement
results for arranging GSM cells in signal strength order for performing
BSIC identification.

\- The UE shall perform BSIC re-confirmation according to Section
8.1.2.5.2.2

The UE shall perform event evaluation for event-triggered reporting
after the BSIC has been verified for a GSM cell. The UE shall use the
last available GSM carrier RSSI measurement results in event evaluation
and event-triggered reporting. Periodic reports shall be triggered
according to the given reporting period even if the BSIC of a GSM cell
has not been verified as defined in Sections 8.6.7.5 and 8.6.7.6 of
\[16\]. Non verified BSIC shall be indicated in the measurement report.

The UE shall consider the BSIC of a GSM cell to be \"verified\", if it
has decoded the SCH of the BCCH carrier and identified the BSIC at least
one time (initial BSIC identification). From that time instant, the UE
shall attempt to re-confirm the BSIC at least once every
T~re-confirm\ abort~ seconds. Otherwise, the UE shall consider the BSIC
of the GSM cell to be \"non-verified\".

The time requirement for initial BSIC identification,
T~identify\ abort~, and the BSIC re-confirmation interval
T~re-confirm\ abort~ can be found in the sections below.

The UE shall be able to decode a BSIC for the purpose of initial BSIC
identification or BSIC reconfirmation within an idle interval, when the
time difference between the middle of the received GSM synchronisation
burst at the UE and the middle of the idle interval is within the limits
specified in Table 8.1.AA.

Table 8.1AA

  ---------------------------------- --------------------------------
  Idle Interval Length (timeslots)   Maximum time difference \[μs\]
  3                                  ± 65

  5                                  ± 732
  6                                  ± 1065
  7                                  ± 1398
  8                                  ± 1732
  9                                  ± 2065
  10                                 ± 2398
  11                                 ± 2732
  12                                 ± 3065
  13                                 ± 3398
  ---------------------------------- --------------------------------

The UE shall be able to perform BSIC verification at levels down to the
reference sensitivity level or reference interference levels as
specified in \[20\].

b\) For a UE not using idle intervals to perform GSM measurements

If a BSIC is decoded and matches the expected value, the UE shall
consider it as \"verified\", otherwise it shall consider it as
\"non-verified\".

The UE shall be able to perform BSIC verification at levels down to the
reference sensitivity level or reference interference levels as
specified in \[20\].

###### 8.1.2.5.2.1 Initial BSIC identification

For GSM cells that are requested with BSIC verified the UE shall attempt
to decode the SCH on the BCCH carrier of the 8 strongest BCCH carriers
of the GSM cells indicated in the measurement control information. The
UE shall give priority for BSIC decodingattempts in decreasing signal
strength order to BSIC carriers with unknown BSIC. The strongest BCCH
carrier is defined as the BCCH carrier having the highest measured GSM
carrier RSSI value after layer 3 filtering. The GSM signal strength
levels used in BSIC identification for arranging GSM cells in signal
strength order shall be based on the latest GSM carrier RSSI measurement
results available.

If the BSIC of a GSM BCCH carriers has been successfully decoded the UE
shall inmediately continue BSIC identification with the next BCCH
carrier, in signal strength order, with unknown BSIC. The GSM cell for
which the BSIC has been successfully identified shall be moved to the
BSIC re-confirmation procedure.

If the UE has not successfully decoded the BSIC of the GSM BCCH carrier
within T~identify\ abort~, the UE shall abort the BSIC decoding attempts
for that GSMBCCH carrier. The UE shall continue to try to perform BSIC
decoding of the next GSM BCCH carrier in signal strength order. The GSM
BCCH carrier for which the BSIC decoding failed shall not be
re-considered for BSIC decoding until BSIC decoding attempts have been
made for all the rest of the 8 strongest GSM BCCH carriers in the
monitored set with unknown BSIC.

Where T~identify\ abort~ = 5000 ms.

###### 8.1.2.5.2.2 BSIC re-confirmation

The requirements of this section are applicable for BSIC
re-confirmation.

The UE shall maintain the timing information of at least 8 identified
GSM cells. Initial timing information is obtained from the initial BSIC
decoding. The timing information shall be updated every time the BSIC is
decoded.

If more than one BSIC can be decoded within the same measurement window
given by the idle intervals, priority shall be given to the least
recently decoded BSIC.

If the UE fails to decode the BSIC after two successive attempts or if
the UE has not been able to re-confirm the BSIC for a GSM BCCH carrier
within T~re-confirm\_abort~ seconds, the UE shall abort the BSIC
re-confirmation attempts for that GSM BCCH carrier. The GSM BCCH carrier
shall be treated as a new GSM BCCH carrier with unidentified BSIC and
the GSM BCCH carrier shall be moved to the initial BSIC decoding
procedure, see section 8.1.2.5.2.1. The UE shall be able to make BSIC
re-confirmation attempts for the 8 strongest GSM cells in the monitored
list.

Where T~re-confirm\ abort~ =5000 ms.

##### 8.1.2.5.3 Periodic Reporting

Reported measurements in periodically triggered measurement reports
shall meet the requirements in section 9.

##### 8.1.2.5.4 Event Triggered Reporting

Reported measurements in event triggered measurement reports shall meet
the requirements in section 9.

The UE shall not send any event triggered measurement reports, as long
as the reporting criteria is not fulfilled.

The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between any event
that will trigger a measurement report until the UE starts to transmit
the measurement report over the Uu interface. This requirement assumes
that the measurement report is not delayed by other RRC signalling on
the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes a delay uncertainty
resulted when inserting the measurement report to the TTI of the uplink
DCCH. The delay uncertainty is twice the TTI of the uplink DCCH.

The event triggered reporting delay requirement is valid, when the UE
for each GSM carrier in the monitored set can take the required number
of samples during the measurement period T~measurement\ period\ GSM~
(see section 8.1.2.5.1).

The event triggered measurement reporting delay for a GSM cell with
verified BSIC, measured without L3 filtering shall be less than
2\*T~measurement\ period\ GSM~, where T~measurement\ period\ GSM~ is
defined in Section 8.1.2.5.1. When L3 filtering is used an additional
delay can be expected. For a GSM cell with non-verified BSIC an
additional delay according to section 8.1.2.5.2.1 Initial BSIC
identification can be expected.

#### 8.1.2.6 TDD Synchronisation to new cells

For the requirements in section 8 and 9 to apply, an intra-frequency or
inter-frequency TDD cell shall be considered detectable when,

where the received P-CCPCH E~c~/I~o~ is defined as

and the received SCH E~c~/I~o~ is defined as

and SCH\_Ec/Ior is equally divided between primary synchronisation code
and the sum of all secondary synchronisation codes, where the secondary
synchronisation codes are also equally divided.

#### 8.1.2.7 E-UTRAN FDD measurements

The requirements in this section apply only to UEs supporting 3.84Mcps
TDD and E-UTRAN FDD.

1\) For a UE requiring idle intervals to perform E-UTRAN FDD
measurements. In CELL\_DCH state when signalled by UTRAN and when idle
intervals are used, the UE shall continuously measure previously
detected E-UTRAN FDD cells and search for new E-UTRAN FDD cells.

used, the UE shall continuously measure GSM cells and search for new GSM
cells given in the monitored set.

2\) For a UE not requiring idle intervals to perform GSM measurements:

\- the UE shall measure all GSM cells present in the monitored set

\- the relevant requirements for GSM dedicated mode when a TCH channel
is assigned in TS 45.008 shall apply. This is further detailed in the

in TS 45.008, when the given measurement time allows the UE to the take
at least 3 GSM carrier RSSI samples per GSM carrier in the monitored set
during the measurement period.

  ---------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------

For the description of the idle intervals see Annex A of 25.225.

In case the UE is not able to acquire the required number of samples per
GSM carrier during one measurement period, the UE shall measure as many
GSM carriers as possible during that measurement period using at least 3
samples per GSM carrier. The GSM carriers that were not measured during
that measurement period shall be measured in the following measurement
periods. This means that, in this particular case, the L1 reporting
period to higher layers of a GSM neighbour can be a multiple of the
measurement period.

2\) For a UE not requiring idle intervals to perform GSM measurements

The samples allocated to each carrier shall as far as possible be
uniformly distributed over each measurement period. At least 3 received
signal level measurement samples are required per RSSI value. The
measurement period is 480 ms.

##### 8.1A.2.5.2 BSIC verification

1\) For a UE requiring idle intervals to perform GSM measurements

The procedure for BSIC verification on a GSM cell can be divided into
the following two tasks:

1\) Initial BSIC identification\
Includes searching for the BSIC and decoding the BSIC for the first time
when there is no knowledge about the relative timing between the TDD and
GSM cell. The UE shall trigger the initial BSIC identification within
the available idle intervals. The requirements for Initial BSIC
identification can be found in section 8.1A.2.5.2.1,\"Initial BSIC
identification\".

2\) BSIC re-confirmation\
Tracking and decoding the BSIC of a GSM cell after initial BSIC
identification is performed. The UE shall trigger the BSIC
re-confirmation within the available idle intervals. The requirements
for BSIC re-confirmation can be found in section 8.1A.2.5.2.2, \"BSIC
re-confirmation\".

Measurements on a GSM cell can be requested with BSIC verified or BSIC
non-verified. If GSM measurements are requested with BSIC verified the
UE shall be able to report the GSM cells with BSIC verified for those
cells where the verification of BSIC has been successful.

The UE shall use the last available GSM carrier RSSI measurement results
for arranging GSM cells in signal strength order for performing BSIC
identification. The UE shall perform event evaluation for
event-triggered reporting after the BSIC has been verified for a GSM
cell. The UE shall use the last available GSM carrier RSSI measurement
results in event evaluation and event-triggered reporting. Periodic
reports shall be triggered according to Sections 8.6.7.5 and 8.6.7.6 of
\[16\]

The BSIC of a GSM cell is considered to be \"verified\" if the UE has
decoded the SCH of the BCCH carrier and identified the BSIC at least one
time (initial BSIC identification) and from that moment the BSIC shall
be re-confirmed at least once every T~re-confirm\ abort~ seconds.
Otherwise the BSIC of the GSM cell is considered as \"non-verified\".
The time requirement for initial BSIC identification,
T~identify\ abort~, and the BSIC re-confirmation interval
T~re-confirm\ abort~ can be found in the sections below.

The UE shall be able to perform BSIC verification at levels down to the
reference sensitivity level or reference interference levels as
specified in TS 45.005.

2\) For a UE not requiring idle intervals to perform GSM measurements

If a BSIC is decoded and matches the expected value, it is considered as
\"verified\", else it is considered as \"non verified\".

The UE shall be able to perform BSIC verification at levels down to the
reference sensitivity level or reference interference levels as
specified in TS 45.005.

###### 8.1A.2.5.2.1 Initial BSIC identification

For GSM cells that are requested with BSIC verified the UE shall attempt
to decode the SCH on the BCCH carrier of the8 strongest BCCH carriers of
the GSM cells indicated in the measurement control information. The UE
shall give priority for BSIC decoding attempts in decreasing signal
strength order to BSIC carriers with unknown BSIC. The strongest BCCH
carrier is defined as the BCCH carrier having the highest measured GSM
carrier RSSI value after layer 3 filtering. The GSM signal strength
levels used in BSIC identification for arranging GSM cells in signal
strength order shall be based on the latest GSM carrier RSSI measurement
results available.

If the BSIC of a GSM BCCH carriers has been successfully decoded the UE
shall immediately continue BSIC identification with the next BCCH
carrier, in signal strength order, with unknown BSIC. The GSM cell for
which the BSIC has been successfully identified shall be moved to the
BSIC re-confirmation procedure.

If the UE has not successfully decoded the BSIC of the GSM BCCH carrier
within T~identify\ abort~, the UE shall abort the BSIC identification
attempts for that GSMBCCH carrier. The UE shall continue to try to
perform BSIC identification of the next GSM BCCH carrier in signal
strength order. The GSM BCCH carrier for which the BSIC identification
failed shall not be re-considered for BSIC identification until BSIC
decoding attempts have been made for all the rest of the 8 strongest GSM
BCCH carriers in the monitored set with unknown BSIC.

T~identify\ abort~ = 5000 ms. This is the time necessary to identify one
new GSM cell. It is assumed for the requirement that the slot allocation
allows measurement windows in the idle periods to be of minimum duration
necessary to perform the measurements.

###### 8.1A.2.5.2.2 BSIC re-confirmation

The requirements of this section are applicable for BSIC
re-confirmation.

The UE shall maintain the timing information of at least 8 identified
GSM cells. Initial timing information is obtained from the initial BSIC
identification. The timing information shall be updated every time the
BSIC is decoded.

For each idle interval, the UE is able to use for BSIC re-confirmation,
the UE shall attempt to decode the BSIC falling within the effective
measurement window. If more than one BSIC can be decoded within the same
measurement window given by the idle intervals, priority shall be given
to the least recently decoded BSIC.

If the UE fails to decode the BSIC after two successive attempts or if
the UE has not been able to re-confirm the BSIC for a GSM BCCH carrier
within T~re-confirm\_abort~ seconds, the UE shall abort the BSIC
re-confirmation attempts for that GSM BCCH carrier. The GSM BCCH carrier
shall be treated as a new GSM BCCH carrier with unidentified BSIC and
the GSM BCCH carrier shall be moved to the initial BSIC decoding
procedure, see section 8.1A.2.5.2.1. The UE shall be able to make BSIC
re-confirmation attempts for the 8 strongest GSM cells in the monitored
list.

T~re-confirm\ abort~ =5000 ms. This is the BSIC reconfirmation interval.

It is assumed for the requirement that the slot allocation allows
measurement windows in the idle periods to be of minimum duration
necessary to perform the measurements.

###### 8.1A.2.5.2.3 Periodic Reporting

Reported measurements in periodically triggered measurement reports
shall meet the requirements in section 9.

###### 8.1A.2.5.2.4 Event Triggered Reporting

Reported measurements in event triggered measurement reports shall meet
the requirements in section 9.

The UE shall not send any event triggered measurement reports, as long
as the reporting criteria is not fulfilled.

The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between any event
that will trigger a measurement report until the UE starts to transmit
the measurement report over the Uu interface. This requirement assumes
that that the measurement report is not delayed by other RRC signalling
on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes a delay
uncertainty resulted when inserting the measurement report to the TTI of
the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertainty is twice the TTI of the uplink
DCCH.

The event triggered reporting delay requirement is valid when the UE for
each GSM carrier in the monitored set can take the required number of
samples during the measurement period T~Measurement\ Period,\ GSM~ (see
section 8.1A.2.5.1).

The event triggered measurement reporting delay for a GSM cell with
verified BSIC, measured without L3 filtering shall be less than
2\*T~Measurement\ Period,\ GSM~, where T~Measurement\ Period,\ GSM~ is
defined in Section 8.1A.2.5.1. When L3 filtering is used an additional
delay can be expected. For a GSM cell with non-verified BSIC an
additional delay according to section 8.1A.2.5.2.1 Initial BSIC
identification can be expected.

RRC signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes a
delay uncertainty resulted when inserting the measurement report to the
TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertainty is twice the TTI of the
uplink DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes a delay which
caused by no UL resources for UE to send the measurement report.

filtering shall be less than T~identify\ E-UTRAN\ FDD~ defined in
Section 8.1A.2.6.1. When L3 filtering is used an additional delay can be
expected.

8.1B General Measurement Requirements in CELL\_DCH State (7.68 Mcps option)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 8.1B.1 Introduction

This section contains requirements on the UE regarding measurement
reporting in CELL\_DCH state. The requirements are split in TDD intra
frequency, TDD inter frequency, FDD and GSM measurements. These
measurements may be used by the UTRAN, e.g. for handover decisions. The
measurements are defined in \[14\], the measurement model is defined in
\[15\] and measurement accuracies are specified in section 9. Control of
measurement reporting is specified in \[16\] and parallel measurements
are specified in section 8.2B. For the description of the idle intervals
see \[14\].

### 8.1B.2 Requirements

#### 8.1B.2.1 UE Measurement Capability

The UE shall be able to monitor up to

\- 32 intra frequency TDD cells (including serving cell), and

\- 32 inter frequency cells, including

> \- TDD mode cells distributed on up to 2 additional TDD carriers and
>
> \- Depending on UE capability, FDD mode cells, distributed on up to 3
> FDD carriers.

\- Depending on UE capability, 32 inter RAT GSM cells.

\- Depending on UE capability, 4 E-UTRA FDD cells per E-UTRA FDD carrier
for up to 4 E-UTRA FDD carriers; and

\- Depending on UE capability, 4 E-UTRA TDD cells per E-UTRA TDD carrier
for up to 4 E-UTRA TDD carriers.

The requirements in section 9 are applicable for a UE performing
measurements according to this section.

For measurements on intra- and inter-frequency TDD, inter-frequency FDD
and GSM cells, idle intervals as described in \[14\] can be used. The
time T~measure~ per 480 ms period available for these measurements is
the sum of the duration of all idle intervals during any given 480 ms
period, i.e. the amount of time not used by the UE for receiving in
active DL timeslots or for transmission in active UL timeslots. Note
that Beacon timeslots of the serving cell can be located inside idle
intervals and that implementation margin due to frequency switching is
not taken into account for T~measure~.

The requirements in this section are based upon the assumption, that the
time durations T~intra~ and T~inter~ during any given 480 ms period for
the purpose of measurements on intra-frequency TDD cells and for
measurements on inter-frequency TDD, inter-frequency FDD and GSM cells
are respectively,

ms

where, M~intra~ is equal to the number of intra-frequency TDD cells in
the neighbour list

The time duration T~inter~ shall be equally shared for inter-frequency
measurements on the different modes and systems which the UE has
capability for and that are in the monitored set signalled by UTRAN,
i.e.

For this, the following parameters are defined,

T~TDD\ inter~ is the time duration allocated for the purpose of TDD
inter-frequency measurements.

T~FDD\ inter~ is the time duration allocated for the purpose of FDD
inter-frequency measurements.

T~GSM\ inter~ is the time duration allocated for the purpose of GSM
measurements.

N~TDD~ is equal to 1 if there are inter-frequency TDD cells in the
neighbour list, equal to 0 otherwise.

N~FDD~ is equal to 1 if the UE has capability for FDD and if there are
inter-frequency FDD cells in the neighbour list, equal to 0 otherwise.

N~GSM~ is equal to 1 if the UE has capability for GSM and if there are
GSM cells in the neighbour list, equal to 0 otherwise.

#### 8.1B.2.2 TDD intra frequency measurements

During the CELL\_DCH state, the UE shall continuously measure identified
intra frequency TDD cells and search for new intra frequency TDD cells
in the monitored set. In case the UTRAN requests the UE to report
detected set cells, the UE shall also search for intra frequency TDD
cells outside the monitored and active set. Cells, which are neither
included in the active set nor in the monitored set, and are identified
by the UE belong to the detected set according to \[16\].

In order for the requirements in the following subsections to apply, the
Beacon timeslots of the intra-frequency TDD cells indicated in the
measurement control information shall either be synchronised with the
Beacon timeslots of the serving cell or non-overlapping in time with the
active UL timeslots used by the UE for transmission, such that the UE
can measure an intra-frequency TDD cell at least once every frame for
the slot allocation case in use in this cell. The UE shall be capable of
intra frequency measurements during active DL timeslots.

##### 8.1B.2.2.1 Identification of a new cell

The UE shall be able to identify a new detectable intra-frequency TDD
cell belonging to the monitored set within T~identify\ intra~ ms, where
T~identify\ intra~ = 800 ms.

In CELL\_DCH state, the UE shall be capable of performing P-CCPCH RSCP
measurements for X~measurement\ intra~ identified intra-frequency TDD
cells of the monitored set with a measurement period for intra-frequency
P-CCPCH RSCP measurements T~measurement\ period\ intra,~ where

X~measurement\ intra~ = 6 (cells)

T~measurement\ period\ intra~ = 200 ms

The UE physical layer shall be capable of reporting these measurements
to higher layers with the measurement period
T~measurement\ period\ intra~.

If the UE has identified more than X~measurement\ intra~ intra-frequency
TDD cells, the UE shall perform measurements of all identified cells but
the reporting rate of P-CCPCH RSCP measurements of cells from the UE
physical layer to higher layers may be decreased.. The measurement
accuracy for all measured cells shall be as specified in the section 9.

##### 8.1B.2.2.3 Timeslot ISCP measurement capability {#b.2.2.3-timeslot-iscp-measurement-capability .list-paragraph}

In CELL\_DCH state the measurement period for intra frequency Timeslot
ISCP measurements on arbitrary DL timeslots, including Beacon timeslots
is 400 ms. When no inter frequency measurement is scheduled, the UE
shall be capable of performing Timeslot ISCP measurements for a total of
10 different combinations of an arbitrary DL timeslot and an
intra-frequency cell \[16\], including the current serving cell. The UE
physical layer shall be capable of reporting Timeslot ISCP measurements
to higher layers with the measurement period of 400 ms.

When inter-frequency measurements are required by the network, the UE
shall be capable of performing Timeslot ISCP measurements for at least
Y~measurement\ intra\ ISCP~ different combinations, where
Y~measurement\ intra\ ISCP~ is defined in the following equation. Any
Timeslot ISCP measurement that could not be performed during that
measurement period, shall be measured in the following measurement
periods. The measurement accuracy of the Timeslot ISCP measurement shall
be as specified in the section 9.

whereby function Floor(x) takes the integer part of x.

\- X~basic\ measurement\ ISCP~ = 10 (combinations of an arbitrary DL
timeslot and an intra-frequency cell)

period for intra frequency Timeslot ISCP measurements.

\- T~intra~ is specified in 8.1B.2.1.

Reporting.

##### 8.1B.2.2.6 Event Triggered Reporting

Reported measurements in event triggered measurement reports shall meet
the requirements in section 9.

The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as long as
the reporting criteria are not fulfilled.

The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between any event
that will trigger a measurement report, until the UE starts to transmit
the measurement report over the Uu interface. This requirement assumes
that the measurement report is not delayed by other RRC signalling on
the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes a delay uncertainty
resulted when inserting the measurement report to the TTI of the uplink
DCCH . The delay uncertainty is twice the TTI of the uplink DCCH.

For P-CCPCH RSCP measurements, the event triggered measurement reporting
delay, on cells belonging to the monitored set, measured without L3
filtering shall be less than T ~identify\ intra~ defined in Section
8.1B.2.2.1. When L3 filtering is used an additional delay can be
expected..

If a cell, belonging to the monitored set has been detectable at least
for the time period T~identify\ intra~ and then enters the reporting
range, the event triggered P-CCPCH RSCP measurement reporting delay
shall be less than T~measurement\_period\ intra~ when the L3 filter has
not been used and the UE P-CCPCH RSCP measurement capabilities of
section 8.1B.2.2.1 are valid.

#### 8.1B.2.3 TDD inter frequency measurements

When signalled by UTRAN during CELL\_DCH state, the UE shall
continuously measure detected inter-frequency TDD cells and search for
new inter-frequency TDD cells indicated in the measurement control
information.

In order for the requirements in the following subsections to apply, the
Beacon timeslots of the inter-frequency TDD cells indicated in the
measurement control information shall be non-overlapping in time with
the active DL and UL timeslots used by the UE for reception and
transmission such that the UE can measure an inter-frequency cell TDD
cell at least once every frame for the slot allocation case in use in
this cell and by assuming 2\*0.5 ms implementation margin for frequency
switching per idle interval.

measurements, the UE shall be able to identify a new detectable
inter-frequency TDD cell belonging to the monitored set within 5000 ms.

When L3 filtering is used, an additional delay can be expected.

X~measurement\ TDD\ inter~ = 6 (cells)

T~measurement\_period\ inter~ = 480 ms. The time period used for
calculating the measurement period T~measurement\_inter~ for inter
frequency P-CCPCH RSCP measurements.

N~TDD~ ~inter~: This is the available number of measurement
opportunities for a Beacon timeslot of an inter-frequency TDD cell
during the time period T~TDD\ inter~. The UE shall consider that a
measurement opportunity on a Beacon timeslot of an inter-frequency TDD
cell is provided if an idle interval of length equal to or greater than
3 timeslots less 2\*0.5 ms implementation margin for frequency switching
per idle interval completely overlaps in time with the Beacon timeslot
of the inter-frequency TDD cell.

N~basic\_identify\_TDD\ inter~ = 80. This is a number of measurement
opportunities for a Beacon timeslot of an inter-frequency TDD cell
during the time period used in the inter frequency TDD equation where
the maximum allowed time for the UE to identify a new detectable
inter-frequency TDD cell is defined.

N~basic\_measurement\_TDD\ inter~ = 5. This is a number of measurement
opportunities for a Beacon timeslot of an inter-frequency TDD cell
during the time period T~TDD\ inter~ used in the inter-frequency TDD
equation where the measurement period for inter-frequency P-CCPCH RSCP
measurements is defined.

N~Freq\ TDD~: This is the number of TDD frequencies indicated in the
inter frequency measurement control information.

Note that the number of measurement opportunities available to the UE
depends on UL and DL timeslot assignments for transmission and reception
and on Beacon timeslot allocations in the inter-frequency TDD cells.

the reporting criteria is not fulfilled.

The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between any event
that will trigger a measurement report, until the UE starts to transmit
the measurement report over the Uu interface. This requirement assumes
that that the measurement report is not delayed by other RRC signalling
on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes a delay
uncertainty resulted when inserting the measurement report to the TTI of
the uplink DCCH . The delay uncertainty is twice the TTI of the uplink
DCCH.

The event triggered measurement reporting delay, measured without L3
filtering shall be less than T ~identify\ inter~ defined in Section
8.1B.2.3.1 When L3 filtering is used an additional delay can be
expected.

If an intra frequency TDD cell has been detectable at least for the time

event triggered measurement reporting delay shall be less than
T~measurement\_period\ inter~ when the L3 filter has not been used.

calculating the measurement period T~measurement\_FDD\ inter~ for inter
frequency CPICH measurements.

T~FDD~ ~inter:\ available~: This is the available time for measurements
on inter-frequency FDD cells. T~FDD\ inter\ available~ shall be derived
from T~FDD\ inter~ by assuming 2\*0.5 ms implementation margin for
frequency switching per idle interval and by only taking into account
the remaining number of full timeslots per idle interval. Idle intervals
smaller than 3 timeslots shall not be taken into account for calculating
T~FDD\ inter\ available~.

T~basic\_identify\_FDD\ inter~ = 800 ms. This is the time period used in
the inter frequency equation where the maximum allowed time for the UE

##### 8.1B.2.4.3 Periodic Reporting

Reported measurements in periodically triggered measurement reports
shall meet the requirements in section 9.

##### 8.1B.2.4.4 Event Triggered Reporting

Reported measurements in event triggered measurement reports shall meet
the requirements in section 9.

The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports as long as the
reporting criteria are not fulfilled.

The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between any event
that will trigger a measurement report until the UE starts to transmit
the measurement report over the Uu interface. This requirement assumes
that that the measurement report is not delayed by other RRC signalling
on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes a delay
uncertainty resulted when inserting the measurement report to the TTI of
the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertanty is twice the TTI of the uplink
DCCH.

The event triggered measurement reporting delay, measured without L3
filtering shall be less than T ~identify\ FDD\ inter~ defined in Section
8.1B.2.4.1. When L3 filtering is used an additional delay can be
expected.

If an inter frequency FDD cell has been detectable at least for the time
period T~identify\_FDD\ inter~ and then enters the reporting range, the
event triggered measurement reporting delay shall be less than
T~measurement\_period\ FDD\ inter~ provided the timing to that cell has
not changed more than +/-32 chips during the time period
T~identify\ FDD\ inter~ and the L3 filter has not been used.

#### 8.1B.2.5 GSM measurements

The requirements in this section shall apply to UE supporting TDD and
GSM.

In CELL\_DCH state, measurements opportunities for GSM measurements are
provided by means of idle intervals.

Measurements on GSM cells can be requested with BSIC verified or BSIC
non-verified.

a\) In CELL\_DCH state, when signaled by UTRAN and when idle intervals
are used for GSM measurements, the UE shall continuously measure GSM
cells and search for new GSM cells given in the monitored set.

\- In section 8.1B.2.1 the split of measurements between different modes
and systems is defined. Every second measurement opportunity scheduled
for GSM measurements, as given by 8.1B.2.1 shall be allocated for GSM
initial BSIC identification.

\- The remaining measurements opportunities scheduled for GSM
measurements shall be used as follows. 3 measurement opportunities out
of 4 shall be allocated for GSM carrier RSSI measurements and 1 out of 4
shall be allocated for GSM BSIC reconfirmation. The scheduling of
measurement opportunities between GSM carrier RSSI measurements and GSM
BSIC reconfirmation is up to the UE.

b\) In CELL\_DCH state, when signaled by UTRAN and when the UE does not
need idle intervals to perform GSM measurements, the UE shall measure
all GSM cells present in the monitored set

> \- the relevant requirements for GSM dedicated mode when a TCH channel
> is assigned in \[21\] shall apply. This is further detailed in the
> following sub-sections.

##### 8.1B.2.5.1 GSM carrier RSSI

a\) For a UE using idle intervals to perform GSM measurements

A UE supporting GSM measurements using idle intervals shall meet the
minimum number of GSM carrier RSSI measurements specified in table 8.1B.

In the CELL\_DCH state the measurement period,
T~measurement\ period\ GSM~, for the GSM carrier RSSI measurement is 480
ms.

The UE shall meet the measurement accuracy requirements stated for RXLEV
in \[21\], when the given measurement time allows the UE to the take at
least 3 GSM carrier RSSI samples per GSM carrier in the monitored set
during the measurement period.

Table 8.1B

  ---------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------
  Idle interval length (timeslots)   Number of GSM carrier RSSI samples in each idle interval

  4                                  2
  5                                  3

  13                                 14
  ---------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------

In case the UE is not able to acquire the required number of samples per
GSM carrier during one measurement period, the UE shall measure as many
GSM carriers as possible during that measurement period using at least 3
samples per GSM carrier. The GSM carriers that were not measured during
that measurement period shall be measured in the following measurement
periods. This means that, in this particular case, the L1 reporting
period to higher layers of a GSM neighbour can be a multiple of the
measurement period.

b\) For a UE not using idle intervals to perform GSM measurements

The samples allocated to each carrier shall as far as possible be
uniformly distributed over each measurement period. At least 3 received
signal level measurement samples are required per GSM carrier RSSI
measurement. The measurement period shall be 480 ms.

##### 8.1B.2.5.2 BSIC verification

a\) For a UE using idle intervals to perform GSM measurements

The procedure for BSIC verification on a GSM cell can be divided into
the following two tasks:

1\) Initial BSIC identification: Includes searching for the BSIC and
decoding the BSIC for the first time when there is no knowledge about
the relative timing between the TDD and GSM cell.. The requirements for
Initial BSIC identification can be found in section 8.1B.2.5.2.1.

2\) BSIC re-confirmation: Tracking and decoding the BSIC of a GSM cell
after initial BSIC identification is performed.. The requirements for
Initial BSIC identification can be found in section 8.1B.2.5.2.2.

Measurements on a GSM cell can be requested with BSIC verified or BSIC
non-verified. If GSM measurements are requested with BSIC verified, the
UE shall be able to report the GSM cells with BSIC verified for those
cells where the verification of BSIC has been successful.

If the UTRAN requests measurements on a GSM cell with BSIC verified, the
UE shall behave as follows:

\- The UE shall perform GSM carrier RSSI measurements according to
Section 8.1B.2.5.1 and the UE shall perform measurement reporting as
defined in Section 8.6.7.6 of \[16\].

\- The UE shall use the last available GSM carrier RSSI measurement
results for arranging GSM cells in signal strength order for performing
BSIC identification.

\- The UE shall perform BSIC re-confirmation according to Section
8.1B.2.5.2.2

The UE shall perform event evaluation for event-triggered reporting
after the BSIC has been verified for a GSM cell. The UE shall use the
last available GSM carrier RSSI measurement results in event evaluation
and event-triggered reporting. Periodic reports shall be triggered
according to the given reporting period even if the BSIC of a GSM cell
has not been verified as defined in Sections 8.6.7.5 and 8.6.7.6 of
\[16\]. Non verified BSIC shall be indicated in the measurement report.

The UE shall consider the BSIC of a GSM cell to be \"verified\", if it
has decoded the SCH of the BCCH carrier and identified the BSIC at least
one time (initial BSIC identification). From that time instant, the UE
shall attempt to re-confirm the BSIC at least once every
T~re-confirm\ abort~ seconds. Otherwise, the UE shall consider the BSIC
of the GSM cell to be \"non-verified\".

The time requirement for initial BSIC identification,
T~identify\ abort~, and the BSIC re-confirmation interval
T~re-confirm\ abort~ can be found in the sections below.

The UE shall be able to decode a BSIC for the purpose of initial BSIC
identification or BSIC reconfirmation within an idle interval, when the
time difference between the middle of the received GSM synchronisation
burst at the UE and the middle of the idle interval is within the limits
specified in Table 8.1C.

Table 8.1C

  ---------------------------------- --------------------------------
  Idle Interval Length (timeslots)   Maximum time difference \[μs\]
  3                                  ± 65
  4                                  ± 398
  5                                  ± 732
  6                                  ± 1065
  7                                  ± 1398
  8                                  ± 1732
  9                                  ± 2065
  10                                 ± 2398
  11                                 ± 2732
  12                                 ± 3065
  13                                 ± 3398
  ---------------------------------- --------------------------------

The UE shall be able to perform BSIC verification at levels down to the
reference sensitivity level or reference interference levels as
specified in \[20\].

b\) For a UE not using idle intervals to perform GSM measurements

If a BSIC is decoded and matches the expected value, the UE shall
consider it as \"verified\", otherwise it shall consider it as
\"non-verified\".

The UE shall be able to perform BSIC verification at levels down to the
reference sensitivity level or reference interference levels as
specified in \[20\].

###### 8.1B.2.5.2.1 Initial BSIC identification

For GSM cells that are requested with BSIC verified the UE shall attempt
to decode the SCH on the BCCH carrier of the 8 strongest BCCH carriers
of the GSM cells indicated in the measurement control information. The
UE shall give priority for BSIC decodingattempts in decreasing signal
strength order to BSIC carriers with unknown BSIC. The strongest BCCH
carrier is defined as the BCCH carrier having the highest measured GSM
carrier RSSI value after layer 3 filtering. The GSM signal strength
levels used in BSIC identification for arranging GSM cells in signal
strength order shall be based on the latest GSM carrier RSSI measurement
results available.

If the BSIC of a GSM BCCH carriers has been successfully decoded the UE
shall inmediately continue BSIC identification with the next BCCH
carrier, in signal strength order, with unknown BSIC. The GSM cell for
which the BSIC has been successfully identified shall be moved to the
BSIC re-confirmation procedure.

If the UE has not successfully decoded the BSIC of the GSM BCCH carrier
within T~identify\ abort~, the UE shall abort the BSIC decoding attempts
for that GSMBCCH carrier. The UE shall continue to try to perform BSIC
decoding of the next GSM BCCH carrier in signal strength order. The GSM
BCCH carrier for which the BSIC decoding failed shall not be
re-considered for BSIC decoding until BSIC decoding attempts have been
made for all the rest of the 8 strongest GSM BCCH carriers in the
monitored set with unknown BSIC.

Where T~identify\ abort~ = 5000 ms.

###### 8.1B.2.5.2.2 BSIC re-confirmation

The requirements of this section are applicable for BSIC
re-confirmation.

The UE shall maintain the timing information of at least 8 identified
GSM cells. Initial timing information is obtained from the initial BSIC
decoding. The timing information shall be updated every time the BSIC is
decoded.

If more than one BSIC can be decoded within the same measurement window
given by the idle intervals, priority shall be given to the least
recently decoded BSIC.

If the UE fails to decode the BSIC after two successive attempts or if
the UE has not been able to re-confirm the BSIC for a GSM BCCH carrier
within T~re-confirm\_abort~ seconds, the UE shall abort the BSIC
re-confirmation attempts for that GSM BCCH carrier. The GSM BCCH carrier
shall be treated as a new GSM BCCH carrier with unidentified BSIC and
the GSM BCCH carrier shall be moved to the initial BSIC decoding
procedure, see section 8.1B.2.5.2.1. The UE shall be able to make BSIC
re-confirmation attempts for the 8 strongest GSM cells in the monitored
list.

Where T~re-confirm\ abort~ =5000 ms.

##### 8.1B.2.5.3 Periodic Reporting

Reported measurements in periodically triggered measurement reports
shall meet the requirements in section 9.

##### 8.1B.2.5.4 Event Triggered Reporting

Reported measurements in event triggered measurement reports shall meet
the requirements in section 9.

The UE shall not send any event triggered measurement reports, as long
as the reporting criteria is not fulfilled.

The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between any event
that will trigger a measurement report until the UE starts to transmit
the measurement report over the Uu interface. This requirement assumes
that the measurement report is not delayed by other RRC signalling on
the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes a delay uncertainty
resulted when inserting the measurement report to the TTI of the uplink
DCCH. The delay uncertainty is twice the TTI of the uplink DCCH.

The event triggered reporting delay requirement is valid, when the UE
for each GSM carrier in the monitored set can take the required number
of samples during the measurement period T~measurement\ period\ GSM~
(see section 8.1B.2.5.1).

The event triggered measurement reporting delay for a GSM cell with
verified BSIC, measured without L3 filtering shall be less than
2\*T~measurement\ period\ GSM~, where T~measurement\ period\ GSM~ is
defined in Section 8.1B.2.5.1. When L3 filtering is used an additional
delay can be expected. For a GSM cell with non-verified BSIC an
additional delay according to section 8.1B.2.5.2.1 Initial BSIC
identification can be expected.

#### 8.1B.2.6 TDD Synchronisation to new cells

For the requirements in section 8 and 9 to apply, an intra-frequency or
inter-frequency TDD cell shall be considered detectable when,

where the received P-CCPCH E~c~/I~o~ is defined as

and the received SCH E~c~/I~o~ is defined as

and SCH\_Ec/Ior is equally divided between primary synchronisation code
and the sum of all secondary synchronisation codes, where the secondary
synchronisation codes are also equally divided.

#### 8.1B.2.7 E-UTRAN FDD measurements

The requirements in this section apply only to UEs supporting 7.68Mcps
TDD and E-UTRAN FDD.

measurements. In CELL\_DCH state when signalled by UTRAN and when idle
intervals are used, the UE shall continuously measure previously
detected E-UTRAN FDD cells and search for new E-UTRAN FDD cells.

2\) For a UE not requiring idle intervals to perform E-UTRAN FDD
measurements:

\- the UE shall measure either all E-UTRAN FDD cells present in the
monitored set or, if only frequencies are provided in the neighbour cell
list, the strongest cells present in the detected set, up to the
monitoring capabilities of the UE.

\- the relevant requirements for E-UTRAN RRC\_CONNECTED mode specified
in 3GPP TS 36.133 \[24\] shall apply. This is further detailed in the
following subclauses 8.1B.2.7.1.

##### 8.1B.2.7.1 Identification of a new cell

When idle intervals are used for E-UTRAN FDD measurements, the UE shall
be able to identify a new detectable E-UTRAN FDD cell within

> timing. The minimum time per idle interval is calculated by assuming
> 2\*0.5 ms for implementation margin.

T~Basic\_Identify\_E-UTRAN\ FDD~ = 480 ms

##### 8.1B.2.7.5 Event Triggered reporting

Reported measurements contained in event triggered measurement reports
shall meet the requirements in section 9.

The UE shall not send any event triggered measurement reports, as long
as no reporting criteria are fulfilled.

The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between an event
that will trigger a measurement report and the point when the UE starts
to transmit the measurement report over the air interface. This
requirement assumes that the measurement report is not delayed by other
RRC signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes a
delay uncertainty resulted when inserting the measurement report to the
TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertainty is twice the TTI of the
uplink DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes a delay which
caused by no UL resources for UE to send the measurement report.

filtering shall be less than T~identify\ E-UTRAN\ FDD~ defined in
Section 8.1B.2.7.1. When L3 filtering is used an additional delay can be
expected.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 8.3.1 Introduction

This section contains requirements on UE capabilities for support of
event triggering and reporting criteria. As long as the measurement
configuration does not exceed the requirements stated in section 8.3.2,
the UE shall meet the performance requirements defined in section 9.

The UE can be requested to make measurements under different measurement
identities. Each Measurement Identity corresponds to either event based
reporting, periodic reporting or no reporting. In case of event based
reporting each Measurement Identity is associated with one or more
events, each identified with an Event Identity. In case of periodic
reporting, a Measurement Identity is associated with one periodic
reporting criterion. In case of no reporting, a Measurement Identity is
associated with one no reporting criterion.

The purpose of this section is to set some limits on the number of
different event, periodic and no reporting criteria the UE may be
requested to track in parallel.

### 8.3.2 Requirements

In this section a reporting criterion corresponds to either one event
(in the case of event based reporting), or one periodic reporting
criterion (in the case of periodic reporting), or one no reporting
criterion (in case of no reporting). Fore event based reporting, each
instance of event, with the same or different Event Identities, is
counted as separate reporting criterion in Table 8.6.

The UE shall be able to support in parallel per category up to E~cat~
reporting criteria according to Table 8.6. The same type of events (e.g.
events 1G) are counted as different events if either any of the
parameters related to the events or their neighbour cell lists or both
differ from each other.

For the measurement categories: Intra-frequency, Inter frequency and
Inter-RAT the UE need not support more than 14 reporting criteria in
total. For the measurement categories Traffic volume and Quality
measurements the UE need not support more than 16 reporting criteria in
total.

For the measurement category Intra-frequency the UE shall support at
least 2 reporting criteria for event type 1G and at least 4 reporting
criteria for an arbitrary combination of event types 1H and 1I.

8.4 Measurements in CELL\_FACH State (3.84 Mcps option)
-------------------------------------------------------

### 8.4.1 Introduction

This section contains requirements on the UE regarding measurement
reporting in CELL\_FACH state. The requirements are split in TDD intra
frequency, TDD inter frequency, FDD and GSM measurements. These
measurements may be used by the UTRAN, e.g. for handover decisions. The
measurements are defined in \[14\], the measurement model is defined in
\[15\] and measurement accuracies are specified in section 9. Control of
measurement reporting is specified in \[16\] and parallel measurements
are specified in section 8.2. For the description of the idle intervals
see \[14\].

### 8.4.2 Requirements

#### 8.4.2.1 UE Measurement Capability

The UE shall be able to monitor up to

\- 32 intra frequency TDD cells (including serving cell), and

\- 32 inter frequency cells, including

> \- TDD mode cells distributed on up to 2 additional TDD carriers and
>
> \- Depending on UE capability, FDD mode cells, distributed on up to 3
> FDD carriers.

\- Depending on UE capability, 32 inter RAT GSM cells.

The requirements in section 9 on P-CCPCH RSCP measurements are
applicable for a UE performing measurements according to this section.
For inter-frequency FDD, TDD and GSM cell re-selection, measurement
occasions as specified in \[16\] and idle intervals as described in
\[14\] are used to find and measure on other cells.

It is defined below how the measurements on different systems and modes
are performed given the time allocated to that system. The requirements
in this section are based on the assumption that the time during the
measurement occasions and idle intervals that is allocated to each of
the different modes and systems shall be equally shared by the modes
which the UE has capability for and that are in the monitored set
signalled by the network.

The UE is required to measure periodically once every time period
T~meas~ on each of the modes and systems, FDD interfrequency cells, TDD
interfrequency cells and GSM carriers, for which the corresponding
parameter N~FDD~, N~TDD~ and N~GSM~ is set to 1, within the measurement
time T~meas~

ms

where the following parameters are defined:

*N~TDD~* = 0 or 1. If there are inter-frequency TDD cells in the
neighbour list *N~TDD~=*1, otherwise *N~TDD~=*0.

*N~FDD~* = 0 or 1. If the UE is capable of FDD and there are FDD cells
in the neighbour list *N~FDD~=1* otherwise *N~FDD\ ~*=0.

*N~GSM~* = 0 or 1. If the UE is capable of GSM and there are GSM cells
in the neighbour list, *N~GSM~=1,* otherwise *N~GSM\ ~*=0.

M\_REP is the Measurement Occasion cycle length in number of frames as
specified in \[16\].

N~TTI~ is the number of frames in each measurement occasion, equal to
the length of the largest TTI on the SCCPCH monitored by the UE. FACHs
that only carry MBMS logical channels (MTCH MSCH or MCCH) are excluded
from measurement occasion calculation.

For 3.84 Mcps TDD UE capable of MBMS reception and if MBMS reception is
active, during Measurement Occasion the UE shall:

\- Start to switch back to its serving cell frequency 1 timeslot prior
to the start of the MBMS reception

\- Switch back to its target inter-frequency within 1 timeslot
immediately after the last MBMS reception.

The FACH Measurement Occasion of N~TTI~ frames will be repeated every
N~TTI~ \* M\_REP frame.

##### 8.4.2.5.2 BSIC verification

a\) For a UE using measurement occasions and idle intervals to perform
GSM measurements

The procedure for BSIC verification on a GSM cell can be divided into
the following two tasks:

1\) Initial BSIC identification: Includes searching for the BSIC and
decoding the BSIC for the first time when there is no knowledge about
the relative timing between the TDD and GSM cell. The requirements for
Initial BSIC identification can be found in 8.4.2.5.2.1.

2\) BSIC re-confirmation: Tracking and decoding the BSIC of a GSM cell
after initial BSIC identification is performed. The requirements for
Initial BSIC identification can be found in 8.4.2.5.2.2.

Measurements on a GSM cell can be requested with BSIC verified or BSIC
non-verified. If GSM measurements are requested with BSIC verified the
UE shall be able to report the GSM cells with BSIC verified for those
cells where the verification of BSIC has been successful.

The UE shall consider the BSIC of a GSM cell to be \"verified\" if it
has decoded the SCH of the BCCH carrier and identified the BSIC at least
one time (initial BSIC identification) From that time instant, the UE
shall attempt to re-confirm the BSIC at least once every 6 times
T~re-confirm\ abort~ seconds. Otherwise, the UE shall consider the BSIC
of the GSM cell to be \"non-verified\".

The time requirement for initial BSIC identification,
T~identify\ abort~, and the BSIC re-confirmation interval
T~re-confirm\ abort~ can be found in the sections below.

The UE shall be able to decode a BSIC for the purpose of initial BSIC
identification or BSIC reconfirmation within a measurement opportunity,
when the time difference between the middle of the received GSM
synchronisation burst at the UE and the middle of the measurement
opportunity is within the limits specified in Table 8.7.A.

  120                                ± 39100
  ---------------------------------- --------------------------------

The UE shall be able to perform BSIC verification at levels down to the
reference sensitivity level or reference interference levels as
specified in \[20\].

b\) For a UE not using measurement occasions and idle intervals to
perform GSM measurements

The UE shall attempt to verify the BSIC for at least the 6 strongest GSM
carriers at least every 10 seconds, to confirm that it is monitoring the
same cell, as far as UTRA RACH procedure does not prevent UE from
decoding BSIC.

If a BSIC is decoded and matches the expected value, the UE shall
consider it as \"verified\", otherwise it shall consider it as
\"non-verified\".

The UE shall be able to perform BSIC verification at levels down to the
reference sensitivity level or reference interference levels as
specified in \[20\].

###### 8.4.2.5.2.1 Initial BSIC identification

This measurement shall be performed in the measurement opportunities as
described in 8.4.2.5.

The UE shall continuously attempt to decode the BSIC of the SCH on the
BCCH carrier of the 6 strongest BCCH carriers of the GSM cells indicated
in the measurement control information. The UE shall give priority for
BSIC decoding attempts in decreasing signal strength order to BSIC
carriers with unknown BSIC. The strongest BCCH carrier is defined as the
BCCH carrier having the highest measured GSM carrier RSSI value.

When the UE attempts to decode the BSIC of one GSM BCCH carrier with
unknown BSIC, the UE shall use all available measurementopportunities
allocated for GSM initial BSIC identification according section 8.4.2.5
to attempt to decode the BSIC from that GSM BCCH carrier.

If the BSIC of the GSM BCCH carrier has been successfully decoded the UE
shall immediately continue BSIC identification with the next GSM BCCH
carrier, in signal strength order, with unknown BSIC. The GSM cell for
which the BSIC has been successfully identified shall be moved to the
BSIC re-confirmation procedure.

If the UE has not successfully decoded the BSIC of the GSM BCCH carrier
within T~identify\ abort~, the UE shall abort the BSIC identification
attempts for that GSM BCCH carrier. The UE shall continue to try to
perform BSIC identification of the next GSM BCCH carrier in signal
strength order. The GSM BCCH carrier for which the BSIC identification
failed shall not be re-considered for BSIC identification until BSIC
identification attempts have been made for all the rest of the 6
strongest GSM BCCH carriers in the monitored set with unknown BSIC.

T~identify\ abort~ is specified in section 8.1.2.5.

###### 8.4.2.5.2.2 BSIC re-confirmation

The requirements of this section are applicable for BSIC
re-confirmation.

The UE shall maintain the timing information of 6 identified GSM cells.
Initial timing information is obtained from the initial BSIC
identification. The timing information shall be updated every time the
BSIC is decoded.

For each measurement opportunity allocated for GSM BSIC reconfirmation
as described in 8.4.2.5, the UE shall attempt to decode the BSIC
occurring during the measurement opportunity. When the UE has to select
one out of several possible GSM cells to reconfirm during the same
measurement opportunity, priority shall be given to the least recently
decoded BSIC.

If the UE fails to decode the BSIC after two successive attempts, the UE
shall abort the BSIC re-confirmation attempts for that GSM cell. The GSM
cell shall be treated as a new GSM cell with unidentified BSIC and the
GSM cell shall be moved to the initial BSIC identification procedure,
see section 8.4.2.5.2.1. The UE shall be able to make BSIC
re-confirmation attempts for the 6 strongest GSM cells in the monitored
list.

Where T~re-confirm\ abort~ is specified in section 8.1.2.5.

in section 9. Control of measurement reporting is specified in TS 25.331
and parallel measurements are specified in section 8.2. For the
description of the idle intervals see TS 25.225, Annex A.

NOTE: In CELL\_FACH state, there are no requirements for measurements of
inter-RAT E-UTRAN cells.

### 8.4A.2 Requirements

\- Depending on UE capability, FDD cells, distributed on up to 3 FDD
carriers.

\- Depending on UE capability, 32 GSM cells distributed on up to 32 GSM

in this section are based on the assumption that the time during the
measurement occasions and idle intervals that is allocated to each of
the different modes and systems shall be equally shared by the modes
which the UE has capability for and that are in the monitored set
signalled by the network.

The UE is required to measure periodically once every time period

verification in Cell FACH state.

1\) For a UE requiring idle intervals or measurement occasions to

  ----------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------

In case the UE is not able to acquire the required number of samples per
GSM carrier during one measurement period, the UE shall measure as many
GSM carriers as possible during that measurement period using at least 3
samples per GSM carrier. The GSM carriers that were not measured during
that measurement period shall be measured in the following measurement
periods. This means that, in this particular case, the L1 reporting
period to higher layers of a GSM neighbour can be a multiple of the
measurement period.

2\) For a UE not requiring idle intervals and measurement occasions to
perform GSM measurements:

The samples allocated to each carrier shall as far as possible be
uniformly distributed over each measurement period. At least 3 received
signal level measurement samples are required per RSSI value. The
measurement period is 480 ms.

In case UTRA RACH procedure prevents the UE from acquiring the required
number of samples per GSM carrier during one measurement period, the GSM
carriers that were not measured during that measurement period shall be
measured in the following measurement periods.

##### 8.4A.2.5.2 BSIC verification

1\) For a UE requiring idle intervals or measurement occasions to
perform GSM measurements.

The procedure for BSIC verification on a GSM cell can be divided into
the following two tasks:

Initial BSIC identification\
Includes searching for the BSIC and decoding the BSIC for the first time
when there is no knowledge about the relative timing between the TDD and
GSM cell. The UE shall trigger the initial BSIC identification within
50% of the available measurement windows. The requirements for Initial
BSIC identification can be found in 8.4A.2.5.2.1,Initial BSIC
identification

BSIC re-confirmation\
Tracking and decoding the BSIC of a GSM cell after initial BSIC
identification is performed. The UE shall trigger the BSIC
re-confirmation within the available measurement windows. The
requirements for BSIC re-confirmation can be found in section
8.4A.2.5.2.2, BSIC re-confirmation.

Measurements on a GSM cell can be requested with BSIC verified or BSIC
non-verified. If GSM measurements are requested with BSIC verified the
UE shall be able to report the GSM cells with BSIC verified for those
cells where the verification of BSIC has been successful.

The BSIC of a GSM cell is considered to be \"verified\" if the UE has
decoded the SCH of the BCCH carrier and identified the BSIC at least one
time (initial BSIC identification) and from that moment the BSIC shall
be re-confirmed at least once every 6 times T~re-confirm\ abort~
seconds. Otherwise the BSIC of the GSM cell is considered as
\"non-verified\". The time requirement for initial BSIC identification,
T~identify\ abort~, and the BSIC re-confirmation interval
T~re-confirm\ abort~ can be found in the sections below.

The UE shall be able to perform BSIC verification at levels down to the
reference sensitivity level or reference interference levels as
specified in TS 45.005.

2\) For a UE not requiring idle intervals and measurement occasions to
perform GSM measurements:

The UE shall attempt to check the BSIC for at least the 6 strongest GSM
carriers at least every 10 seconds, to confirm that it is monitoring the
same cell, as far as UTRA RACH procedure does not prevent UE from
decoding BSIC.

If a BSIC is decoded and matches the expected value, it is considered as
\"verified\", else it is considered as \"non verified\".

The UE shall be able to perform BSIC verification at levels down to the
reference sensitivity level or reference interference levels as
specified in TS 45.005.

###### 8.4A.2.5.2.1 Initial BSIC identification

This measurement is performed in the measurement windows allocated for
Initial BSIC identification as described in 8.4A.2.5.

For GSM cells that are requested with BSIC verified the UE shall
continuously attempt to decode the SCH on the BCCH carrier of the 6
strongest BCCH carriers of the GSM cells indicated in the measurement
control information. The UE shall give priority for BSIC decoding
attempts in decreasing signal strength order to BSIC carriers with
unknown BSIC. The strongest BCCH carrier is defined as the BCCH carrier
having the highest measured GSM carrier RSSI value.

When the UE attempts to decode the BSIC of one GSM BCCH carrier with
unknown BSIC, the UE shall use all available measurements windows
allocated for GSM initial BSIC identification according section 8.4A.2.5
to attempt to decode the BSIC from that GSM BCCH carrier.

If the BSIC of the GSM BCCH carrier has been successfully decoded the UE
shall immediately continue BSIC identification with the next GSM BCCH
carrier, in signal strength order, with unknown BSIC. The GSM cell for
which the BSIC has been successfully identified shall be moved to the
BSIC re-confirmation procedure.

If the UE has not successfully decoded the BSIC of the GSM BCCH carrier
within T~identify\ abort~, the UE shall abort the BSIC identification
attempts for that GSM BCCH carrier. The UE shall continue to try to
perform BSIC identification of the next GSM BCCH carrier in signal
strength order. The GSM BCCH carrier for which the BSIC identification
failed shall not be re-considered for BSIC identification until BSIC
identification attempts have been made for all the rest of the 6
strongest GSM BCCH carriers in the monitored set with unknown BSIC.

T~identify\ abort~ is specified in section 8.1A.2.5.

###### 8.4A.2.5.2.2 BSIC re-confirmation

The requirements of this section are applicable for BSIC
re-confirmation.

The UE shall maintain the timing information of 6 identified GSM cells.
Initial timing information is obtained from the initial BSIC
identification. The timing information shall be updated every time the
BSIC is decoded.

For each measurement window allocated for GSM BSIC reconfirmation as
described in 8.4A.2.5, the UE shall attempt to decode the BSIC falling
within the effective measurement window duration. If more than one BSIC
can be decoded within the same measurement window, priority shall be
given to the least recently decoded BSIC.

If the UE fails to decode the BSIC after two successive attempts, the UE
shall abort the BSIC re-confirmation attempts for that GSM cell. The GSM
cell shall be treated as a new GSM cell with unidentified BSIC and the

8.4B Measurements in CELL\_FACH State (7.68 Mcps option)
--------------------------------------------------------

### 8.4B.1 Introduction

This section contains requirements on the UE regarding measurement
reporting in CELL\_FACH state. The requirements are split in TDD intra
frequency, TDD inter frequency, FDD and GSM measurements. These
measurements may be used by the UTRAN, e.g. for handover decisions. The
measurements are defined in \[14\], the measurement model is defined in
\[15\] and measurement accuracies are specified in section 9. Control of
measurement reporting is specified in \[16\] and parallel measurements
are specified in section 8.2B. For the description of the idle intervals
see \[14\].

### 8.4B.2 Requirements

#### 8.4B.2.1 UE Measurement Capability

The UE shall be able to monitor up to

\- 32 intra frequency TDD cells (including serving cell), and

\- 32 inter frequency cells, including

> \- TDD mode cells distributed on up to 2 additional TDD carriers and
>
> \- Depending on UE capability, FDD mode cells, distributed on up to 3
> FDD carriers.

\- Depending on UE capability, 32 inter RAT GSM cells.

The requirements in section 9 on P-CCPCH RSCP measurements are
applicable for a UE performing measurements according to this section.
For inter-frequency FDD, TDD and GSM cell re-selection, measurement
occasions as specified in \[16\] and idle intervals as described in
\[14\] are used to find and measure on other cells.

It is defined below how the measurements on different systems and modes
are performed given the time allocated to that system. The requirements
in this section are based on the assumption that the time during the
measurement occasions and idle intervals that is allocated to each of
the different modes and systems shall be equally shared by the modes
which the UE has capability for and that are in the monitored set
signalled by the network.

The UE is required to measure periodically once every time period
T~meas~ on each of the modes and systems, FDD interfrequency cells, TDD
interfrequency cells and GSM carriers, for which the corresponding
parameter N~FDD~, N~TDD~ and N~GSM~ is set to 1, within the measurement
time T~meas~

ms

where the following parameters are defined:

*N~TDD~* = 0 or 1. If there are inter-frequency TDD cells in the
neighbour list *N~TDD~=*1, otherwise *N~TDD~=*0.

*N~FDD~* = 0 or 1. If the UE is capable of FDD and there are FDD cells
in the neighbour list *N~FDD~=1* otherwise *N~FDD\ ~*=0.

*N~GSM~* = 0 or 1. If the UE is capable of GSM and there are GSM cells
in the neighbour list, *N~GSM~=1,* otherwise *N~GSM\ ~*=0.

M\_REP is the Measurement Occasion cycle length in number of frames as
specified in \[16\].

N~TTI~ is the number of frames in each measurement occasion, equal to
the length of the largest TTI on the SCCPCH monitored by the UE.

For 7.68 Mcps TDD UE capable of MBMS reception and if MBMS reception is
active, during Measurement Occasion the UE shall:

\- Start to switch back to its serving cell frequency 1 timeslot prior
to the start of the MBMS reception

\- Switch back to its target inter-frequency within 1 timeslot
immediately after the last MBMS reception.

The FACH Measurement Occasion of N~TTI~ frames will be repeated every
N~TTI~ \* M\_REP frame.

In case the UE is not able to acquire the required number of samples per
GSM carrier during one measurement period, the UE shall measure as many
GSM carriers as possible during that measurement period using at least 3
samples per GSM carrier. The GSM carriers that were not measured during
that measurement period shall be measured in the following measurement
periods. This means that, in this particular case, the L1 reporting
period to higher layers of a GSM neighbour can be a multiple of the
measurement period.

b\) For a UE not using measurement occasions and idle intervals to
perform GSM measurements

The samples allocated to each carrier shall as far as possible be
uniformly distributed over each measurement period. At least 3 received
signal level measurement samples are required per GSM carrier RSSI
measurement. The measurement period shall be 480 ms.

number of samples per GSM carrier during one measurement period, the GSM
carriers that were not measured during that measurement period shall be
measured in the following measurement periods.

##### 8.4B.2.5.2 BSIC verification

a\) For a UE using measurement occasions and idle intervals to perform
GSM measurements

The procedure for BSIC verification on a GSM cell can be divided into
the following two tasks:

1\) Initial BSIC identification: Includes searching for the BSIC and
decoding the BSIC for the first time when there is no knowledge about
the relative timing between the TDD and GSM cell. The requirements for
Initial BSIC identification can be found in 8.4B.2.5.2.1.

2\) BSIC re-confirmation: Tracking and decoding the BSIC of a GSM cell
after initial BSIC identification is performed. The requirements for
Initial BSIC identification can be found in 8.4B.2.5.2.2.

Measurements on a GSM cell can be requested with BSIC verified or BSIC
non-verified. If GSM measurements are requested with BSIC verified the
UE shall be able to report the GSM cells with BSIC verified for those
cells where the verification of BSIC has been successful.

The UE shall consider the BSIC of a GSM cell to be \"verified\" if it
has decoded the SCH of the BCCH carrier and identified the BSIC at least
one time (initial BSIC identification) From that time instant, the UE
shall attempt to re-confirm the BSIC at least once every 6 times
T~re-confirm\ abort~ seconds. Otherwise, the UE shall consider the BSIC
of the GSM cell to be \"non-verified\".

The time requirement for initial BSIC identification,
T~identify\ abort~, and the BSIC re-confirmation interval
T~re-confirm\ abort~ can be found in the sections below.

The UE shall be able to decode a BSIC for the purpose of initial BSIC
identification or BSIC reconfirmation within a measurement opportunity,
when the time difference between the middle of the received GSM
synchronisation burst at the UE and the middle of the measurement
opportunity is within the limits specified in Table 8.8.C.

  120                                ± 39100
  ---------------------------------- --------------------------------

The UE shall be able to perform BSIC verification at levels down to the
reference sensitivity level or reference interference levels as
specified in \[20\].

b\) For a UE not using measurement occasions and idle intervals to
perform GSM measurements

The UE shall attempt to verify the BSIC for at least the 6 strongest GSM
carriers at least every 10 seconds, to confirm that it is monitoring the
same cell, as far as UTRA RACH procedure does not prevent UE from
decoding BSIC.

If a BSIC is decoded and matches the expected value, the UE shall
consider it as \"verified\", otherwise it shall consider it as
\"non-verified\".

The UE shall be able to perform BSIC verification at levels down to the
reference sensitivity level or reference interference levels as
specified in \[20\].

###### 8.4B.2.5.2.1 Initial BSIC identification

This measurement shall be performed in the measurement opportunities as
described in 8.4B.2.5.

The UE shall continuously attempt to decode the BSIC of the SCH on the
BCCH carrier of the 6 strongest BCCH carriers of the GSM cells indicated
in the measurement control information. The UE shall give priority for
BSIC decoding attempts in decreasing signal strength order to BSIC
carriers with unknown BSIC. The strongest BCCH carrier is defined as the
BCCH carrier having the highest measured GSM carrier RSSI value.

When the UE attempts to decode the BSIC of one GSM BCCH carrier with
unknown BSIC, the UE shall use all available measurement opportunities
allocated for GSM initial BSIC identification according section 8.4B.2.5
to attempt to decode the BSIC from that GSM BCCH carrier.

If the BSIC of the GSM BCCH carrier has been successfully decoded the UE
shall immediately continue BSIC identification with the next GSM BCCH
carrier, in signal strength order, with unknown BSIC. The GSM cell for
which the BSIC has been successfully identified shall be moved to the
BSIC re-confirmation procedure.

If the UE has not successfully decoded the BSIC of the GSM BCCH carrier
within T~identify\ abort~, the UE shall abort the BSIC identification
attempts for that GSM BCCH carrier. The UE shall continue to try to
perform BSIC identification of the next GSM BCCH carrier in signal
strength order. The GSM BCCH carrier for which the BSIC identification
failed shall not be re-considered for BSIC identification until BSIC
identification attempts have been made for all the rest of the 6
strongest GSM BCCH carriers in the monitored set with unknown BSIC.

T~identify\ abort~ is specified in section 8.1B.2.5.

###### 8.4B.2.5.2.2 BSIC re-confirmation

The requirements of this section are applicable for BSIC
re-confirmation.

The UE shall maintain the timing information of 6 identified GSM cells.
Initial timing information is obtained from the initial BSIC
identification. The timing information shall be updated every time the
BSIC is decoded.

For each measurement opportunity allocated for GSM BSIC reconfirmation
as described in 8.4B.2.5, the UE shall attempt to decode the BSIC
occurring during the measurement opportunity. When the UE has to select
one out of several possible GSM cells to reconfirm during the same
measurement opportunity, priority shall be given to the least recently
decoded BSIC.

If the UE fails to decode the BSIC after two successive attempts, the UE
shall abort the BSIC re-confirmation attempts for that GSM cell. The GSM
cell shall be treated as a new GSM cell with unidentified BSIC and the
GSM cell shall be moved to the initial BSIC identification procedure,
see section 8.4B.2.5.2.1. The UE shall be able to make BSIC
re-confirmation attempts for the 6 strongest GSM cells in the monitored
list.

Where T~re-confirm\ abort~ is specified in section 8.1B.2.5.

9 Measurements performance requirements
=======================================

One of the key services provided by the physical layer is the
measurement of various quantities which are used to trigger or perform a
multitude of functions. Both the UE and the UTRAN are required to
perform a variety of measurements. The complete list of measurements is
specified in 3GPP TS 25.302 \"Services Provided by Physical Layer\". The
physical layer measurements for TDD are described and defined in 3GPP TS
25.225 \"Physical layer - Measurements (TDD)\". In this clause for TDD,
per each measurement the relevant requirements on performance in terms
of accuracy are reported.

The accuracy requirements in this clause are applicable for AWGN radio
propagation conditions.

Unless explicitly stated,

\- Reported measurements shall be within defined range in 90 % of the
cases.

\- Measurement channel is 12,2 kbps as defined in 3GPP TS 25.102 annex
A. This measurement channel is used both in active cell and cells to be
measured.

\- Physical channels used as defined in 3GPP TS 25.102 annex A.

\- All requirements are defined when UE is in a CELL\_DCH or CELL\_FACH
stage. The difference between modes are the reporting delay. Some of the
measurements are not requested to be reported in both stages.

\- Single task reporting.

\- Power control is active.

9.1 Measurements performance for UE
-----------------------------------

The requirements in this clause are applicable for a UE:

\- in state CELL\_DCH and state CELL\_FACH.

\- that is synchronised to the cell that is measured.

The reported measurement result after layer 1 filtering shall be an
estimate of the average value of the measured quantity over the
measurement period. The reference point for the measurement result after
layer 1 filtering is referred to as point B in the measurement model
described in TS25.302.

The accuracy requirements in this clause are valid for the reported
measurement result after layer 1 filtering. The accuracy requirements
are verified from the measurement report at point D in the measurement
model having the layer 3 filtering disabled.

### 9.1.1 Performance for UE measurements in downlink (RX)

10 FPACH physical layer information field definition (1.28 Mcps TDD)
====================================================================

1.28 Mcps TDD introduces the FPACH (Fast Physical Access CHannel) which
carries physical layer information. Two of these information fields are
the 'received starting position of the UpPCH' (Uplink Pilot CHannel) and
the 'transmit power level command for the RACH message'. Both
information fields are directly (received starting position of the
UpPCH) or can be indirectly (transmit power level command for the RACH
message) derived from measurements but are no measurements themselves.

10.1 Received starting position of the UpPCH (UpPCH~POS~) (1.28 Mcps TDD)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The received starting position of the UpPCH (UpPCH~POS~) is derectly
derived from measurement, it is equivalent to the received SYNC-UL
Timing Deviation for 1.28 Mcps. Its accurecy and range/mapping is
defined in section 9.2.1.10. The information field value, UpPCH~POS~
-FIELD\_LEV\_xxxx, is equivalent to the reported value
SYNC\_UL\_TIME\_DEV\_xxxx.

10.2 Transmit Power Level Command for the RACH message (1.28 Mcps TDD)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

### 10.2.1 Accuracy requirements

Since this is a desired RX power at the node B and this is no measured
value and the derivation of this value in the node B is implementation
specific, accuracy requirements are not applicable.

### 10.2.2 Range/mapping

PRX~PRACH,des~ FIELD is given with a resolution of 0.5 dB with the range
\[-120,-80\] dBm.

PRX~PRACH,des~ FIELD shall be transmitted in the FPACH.

######## Annex A (normative): Test Cases

A.1 Purpose of Annex
====================

This Annex specifies test specific parameters for some of the functional
requirements in chapters 4 to 9. The tests provide additional
information to how the requirements should be interpreted for the
purpose of conformance testing. The tests in this Annex are described
such that one functional requirement may be tested in one or several
test and one test may verify several requirements. Some requirements may
lack a test.

The conformance tests are specified in TS34.122. Statistical
interpretation of the requirements is described in Annex A.2.

A.2 Requirement classification for statistical testing
======================================================

Requirements in this specification are either expressed as absolute
requirements with a single value stating the requirement, or expressed
as a success rate. There are no provisions for the statistical
variations that will occur when the parameter is tested.

Annex A outlines the test in more detail and lists the test parameters
needed. The test will result in an outcome of a test variable value for
the DUT inside or outside the test limit. Overall, the probability of a
\"good\" DUT being inside the test limit(s) and the probability of a
\"bad\" DUT being outside the test limit(s) should be as high as
possible. For this reason, when selecting the test variable and the test
limit(s), the statistical nature of the test is accounted for.

The statistical nature depends on the type of requirement. Some have
large statistical variations, while others are not statistical in nature
at all. When testing a parameter with a statistical nature, a confidence
level is set. This establishes the probability that a DUT passing the
test actually meets the requirement and determines how many times a test
has to be repeated and what the pass and fail criteria are. Those
aspects are not covered by TS 25.123. The details of the tests, how many
times to run it and how to establish confidence in the tests are
described in TS 34.122. This Annex establishes what the test variable is
and whether it can be viewed as statistical in nature or not.

A.2.1 Types of requirements in TS 25.123
----------------------------------------

### A.2.1.1 Time and delay requirements on UE higher layer actions

One part of the RRM requirements are delay requirements:

\- In idle mode (A.4) there is cell re-selection delay.

\- In UTRAN Connected Mode Mobility (A.5) there is measurement reporting
delay, handover delay and cell re-selection delay.

\- In RRC Connection Control (A.6) there is RRC re-establishment delay.
In case of 1,28Mcps TDD option there is also TFC blocking delay.

All have in common that the UE is required to perform an action
observable in higher layers (e.g. camp on the correct cell) within a
certain time after a specific event (e.g. a new strong pilot arises).
The delay time is statistical in nature for several reasons, among
others that measurements required by the UE are performed in a fading
radio environment.

The variations make a strict limit unsuitable for a test. Instead there
is a condition set for a correct action by the UE, e.g. that the UE
shall camp on the correct cell within X seconds. Then the rate of
correct events as observed during repeated tests shall be at least 90%
in case of AWGN propagation condition. How the limit is applied in the
test depends on the confidence required, further detailed are in TS
34.122.

### A.2.1.2 Measurements of power levels, relative powers and time

A very large number of requirements are on measurements that the UE
performs:

\- In UTRAN Connected Mode Mobility (A.5) there are measurement reports.

\- Measurement performance requirements (A.8) has requirements on all
type of measurements.

The accuracy requirements on measurements are expressed in this
specification as a fixed limit (e.g. +/-X dB), but the measurement error
will have a distribution that is not easily confined in fixed limits.
Assuming a Gaussian distribution of the error, the limits will have to
be set at +/-3,29σ if the probability of failing a \"good DUT\" in a
single test is to be kept at 0,1%. It is more reasonable to set the
limit tighter and test the DUT by counting the rate of measurements that
are within the limits, in a way similar to the requirements on delay.

### A.2.1.3 Implementation requirements

A few requirements are strict actions the UE should take or capabilities
the UE should have, without any allowance for deviations. These
requirements are absolute and should be tested as such. Examples are

\- \"Event triggered report rate\" in UTRAN Connected Mode Mobility
(A.5)

### A.2.1.4 Physical layer timing requirements

All requirements on \"Timing Characteristics\" (A.7) are absolute limits
on timing accuracy.

### A.2.1.5 BER and BLER requirements

Some measurement report procedures in \"UE Measurement procedures\"
(A.8) have requirements on DCH BLER. These are tested in the same way as
BLER requirements in TS 25.102.

A.3 RRM test configurations
===========================

A.3.1 UE with single antenna connector
--------------------------------------

For testing a UE with a single UTRA antenna connector, the test
configuration is fully described in sections A.4 to A.9

A.3.2 UE with multiple antenna connectors
-----------------------------------------

For testing a 1.28Mcps TDD UE with multiple UTRA receive diversity
antenna connectors, test signals from each cell in section A.4 to A.9
shall be generated and applied to each antenna port. For each carrier
frequency specified in the test case, independent noise shall be
generated with independent fading and applied to each antenna port. For
each carrier frequency specified in the testcase, independent noise
shall be generated and applied to each antenna port. The received power
spectral density at each antenna connector n, denoted as Îor,~n~ shall
be the same to the received power spectal density Îor specified for
testing a UE with a single antenna connector. The noise spectral density
at each antenna connector n, denoted as Ioc, ~n~ shall be the same as
the noise spectral density Ioc specified for testing a UE with a single
antenna connector.

A.4 Idle Mode
=============

A.4.1 Cell selection
--------------------

NOTE: This section is included for consistency with numbering with
section 4; no test covering requirements exist.

A.4.2 Cell Re-Selection
-----------------------

For each of the re-selection scenarios in section 4.2 a test is
proposed.

For TDD/TDD cell reselection two scenarios are considered:

Scenario 1: Single carrier case

Scenario 2: Multi carrier case

### A.4.2.1 Scenario 1: Cell re-selection to intra frequency TDD cell

#### A.4.2.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment

This test is to verify the requirement for the cell re-selection delay
in the single carrier case reported in section 4.2.2.

##### A.4.2.1.1.1 3.84 Mcps TDD option

This scenario implies the presence of 1 carrier and 6 cells as given in
Table A.4.1and A.4.2. Cell 1 and cell 2 shall belong to different
Location Areas.

#### A.4.2.1.2 Test Requirements

##### A.4.2.1.2.1 3.84 Mcps TDD option

The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 2, and starts to
send the RRC CONNECTION REQUEST message to perform a Location
Registration on cell 2.

The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 8 s.

The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%.

NOTE:

The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as: T~evaluateTDD~ + T~SI~,
where:

T~evaluateTDD~ A DRX cycle length of 1280ms is assumed for this test
case, this leads to a T~evaluate\ TDD~ of 6.4s according to Table 4.1 in
section 4.2.2.7.

T~SI~ Maximum repetition rate of relevant system info blocks that needs
to be received by the UE to camp on a cell. 1280 ms is assumed in this
test case.

This gives a total of 7.68 s, allow 8s in the test case.

##### A.4.2.1.2.2 1.28 Mcps TDD option

The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 2, and starts to
send SYNCH-UL sequence in the UpPTS for sending the RRC CONNECTION
REQUEST to perform a Location Registration on cell 2.

The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 8 s.

The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%.

NOTE:

The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as: T~evaluateNTDD~ +
T~SI~, where:

T~evaluateNTDD~: A DRX cycle length of 1280ms is assumed for this test
case, this leads to a T~evaluate\ NTDD~ of 6.4s according to Table 4.1A
in section 4.2.

T~SI~: Time required for receiving all the relevant system information
data according to the reception procedure and the RRC procedure delay of
system information blocks defined in 25.331 for a UTRAN cell (ms). 1280
ms is assumed in this test case.

This gives a total of 7.68 s, allow 8s in the test case.

##### A.4.2.1.2.3 7.68 Mcps TDD option

The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 2, and starts to
send the RRC CONNECTION REQUEST message to perform a Location
Registration on cell 2.

The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 8 s.

The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%.

NOTE:

The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as: T~evaluateTDD~ + T~SI~,
where:

T~evaluateTDD~ A DRX cycle length of 1280ms is assumed for this test
case, this leads to a T~evaluate\ TDD~ of 6.4s according to Table 4.1B
in section 4.2.2.7.

T~SI~ Maximum repetition rate of relevant system info blocks that needs
to be received by the UE to camp on a cell. 1280 ms is assumed in this
test case.

This gives a total of 7.68 s, allow 8s in the test case.

### A.4.2.2 Scenario 2: Cell re-selection to inter-frequency TDD cell

#### A.4.2.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment

This test is to verify the requirement for the cell re-selection delay
in the multi carrier case reported in section 4.2.2.

##### A.4.2.2.1.1 3.84 Mcps TDD option

This scenario implies the presence of 2 carriers and 6 cells as given in
Table A.4.3 and A.4.4. Cell 1 and cell 2 shall belong to different
Location Areas.

#### A.4.2.2.2 Test Requirements

##### A.4.2.2.2.1 3.84 Mcps TDD option

The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 2, and starts to
send the RRC CONNECTION REQUEST message to perform a Location
Registration on cell 2.

The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 8 s.

The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%.

NOTE:

The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as: T~evaluateTDD~ + T~SI~,
where:

T~evaluateTDD~ A DRX cycle length of 1280ms is assumed for this test

The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 2, and starts to
send the SYNCH-UL sequence in the UpPTS for sending the RRC CONNECTION
REQUEST to perform a Location Registration on cell 2.

The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 8 s.

The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%.

NOTE:

The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as: T~evaluateNTDD~ +
T~SI~, where:

T~SI~ Time required for receiving all the relevant system information
data according to the reception procedure and the RRC procedure delay of
system information blocks defined in 25.331 for a UTRAN cell (ms). 1280
ms is assumed in this test case.

The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 2, and starts to
send the RRC CONNECTION REQUEST message to perform a Location
Registration on cell 2.

The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 8 s.

The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%.

NOTE:

The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as: T~evaluateTDD~ + T~SI~,

#### A.4.2.2A.2 Test Requirements

The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 2, and starts to
send the RRC CONNECTION REQUEST message to perform a Location
Registration on cell 2.

The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 8 s.

The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%.

NOTE: The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as:

T~evaluateTDD~ + T~SI~

where:

T~evaluateTDD~ A DRX cycle length of 1280ms is assumed for this test
case, this leads to a T~evaluate\ TDD~ of 6.4s according to Table 4.1A
in section 4.2.

T~SI~ Time required for receiving all the relevant system information
data according to the reception procedure and the RRC procedure delay of
system information blocks defined in \[16\] for a UTRAN cell (ms). 1280
ms is assumed in this test case.

This gives a total of 7.68 s, allow 8s in the test case.

### A.4.2.2B Scenario 2B: 3.84 Mcps/1.28 Mcps TDD cell re-selection

#### A.4.2.2B.1 Test Purpose and Environment

This test is to verify the requirement for the 3.84 Mcps/1.28 Mcps TDD
cell re-selection delay reported in section 4.2.

This scenario implies the presence of 1 3.84 Mcps TDD serving cell, and
1 1.28 Mcps TDD cell to be re-selected. The UE is requested to monitor
neighbouring cells on 1 3.84Mcps TDD carrier and 1 1.28Mcps TDD carrier.
Test parameters are given in Table A.4.3C, A4.4C, and A.4.4D. Cell 1 and
cell 2 shall belong to different Location Areas.

#### A.4.2.2B.2 Test Requirements

The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 2, and starts to
send the SYNCH-UL sequence in the UpPTS for sending the RRC CONNECTION
REQUEST to perform a Location Registration on cell 2.

The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 8 s.

The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%.

NOTE: The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as:

T~evaluateNTDD~ + T~SI~

where:

T~evaluateNTDD~ A DRX cycle length of 1280ms is assumed for this test
case, this leads to a T~evaluate\ NTDD~ of 6.4s according to Table 4.1
in section 4.2.

T~SI~ Time required for receiving all the relevant system information
data according to the reception procedure and the RRC procedure delay of
system information blocks defined in \[16\] for a UTRAN cell (ms). 1280
ms is assumed in this test case.

This gives a total of 7.68 s, allow 8s in the test case.

### A.4.2.2C Scenario 2C: 3.84 Mcps TDD cell re-selection for 7.68 Mcps TDD UE

#### A.4.2.2C.1 Test Purpose and Environment

This test is to verify the requirement for the 7.68 Mcps TDD OPTION/3.84
Mcps TDD OPTION cell re-selection delay reported in section 4.2.

This scenario implies the presence of 1 higher chip rate (7.68 Mcps TDD
OPTION) and 1 high chip rate (3.84 Mcps TDD OPTION)) cell as given in
Table A.4.4E and A4.4F.

The ranking of the cells shall be made according to the cell reselection
criteria specified in TS25.304.

Cell 1 and cell 2 shall belong to different Location Areas.

#### A.4.2.2C.2 Test Requirements

The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 2, and starts to
send the RRC CONNECTION REQUEST message to perform a Location
Registration on cell 2.

The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 8 s.

The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%.

NOTE: The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as:

T~evaluateTDD~ + T~SI~

where:

T~evaluateTDD~ A DRX cycle length of 1280ms is assumed for this test
case, this leads to a T~evaluate\ TDD~ of 6.4s according to Table 4.1B
in section 4.2.

T~SI~ Maximum repetition rate of relevant system info blocks that needs
to be received by the UE to camp on a cell. 1280 ms is assumed in this
test case.

This gives a total of 7.68 s, allow 8s in the test case.

### A.4.2.2D Scenario 2D: 3.84 Mcps/7.68 Mcps TDD cell re-selection 

#### A.4.2.2D.1 Test Purpose and Environment

This test is to verify the requirement for the 3.84 Mcps/7.68 Mcps TDD
cell re-selection delay reported in section 4.2.

This scenario implies the presence of one 3.84 Mcps TDD serving cell,
and one 7.68 Mcps TDD cell to be re-selected. The UE is requested to
monitor neighbouring cells on one 3.84Mcps TDD carrier and one 7.68 Mcps
TDD carrier. Test parameters are given in Table A.4.4G and A.4.4H. Cell
1 and cell 2 shall belong to different Location Areas.

#### A.4.2.2E.2 Test Requirements

The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 2, and starts to
send the SYNCH-UL sequence in the UpPTS for sending the RRC CONNECTION
REQUEST to perform a Location Registration on cell 2.

The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 8 s.

The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%.

NOTE: The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as:

T~evaluateNTDD~ + T~SI~

where:

T~evaluateNTDD~ A DRX cycle length of 1280ms is assumed for this test
case, this leads to a T~evaluate\ NTDD~ of 6.4s according to Table 4.1
in section 4.2.

T~SI~ Time required for receiving all the relevant system information
data according to the reception procedure and the RRC procedure delay of
system information blocks defined in \[16\] for a UTRAN cell (ms). 1280
ms is assumed in this test case.

This gives a total of 7.68 s, allow 8s in the test case.

### A.4.2.3 Scenario 3: TDD/FDD cell re-selection 

#### A.4.2.3.1 Test Purpose and Environment

##### A.4.2.3.1.1 3.84 Mcps TDD option

This test is to verify the requirement for the TDD/FDD cell re-selection
delay reported in section 4.2.2.

This scenario implies the presence of 1 UTRA TDD and 1 UTRA FDD cell as
given in Table A.4.5 and A.4.6. The maximum repetition period of the
relevant system information blocks that need to be received by the UE to
camp on a cell shall be 1280 ms.

Cell 1 and cell 2 shall belong to different Location Areas.

##### A.4.2.3.1.3 7.68 Mcps TDD option

This test is to verify the requirement for the TDD/FDD cell re-selection
delay reported in section 4.2.2.

This scenario implies the presence of 1 UTRA TDD and 1 UTRA FDD cell as
given in Table A.4.5B and A.4.6B. The maximum repetition period of the
relevant system information blocks that need to be received by the UE to
camp on a cell shall be 1280 ms.

Cell 1 and cell 2 shall belong to different Location Areas.

#### A.4.2.3.2 Test Requirements

##### A.4.2.3.2.1 3.84 Mcps TDD option

The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 2, and starts to
send preambles on the PRACH for sending the RRC CONNECTION REQUEST
message to perform a Location Registration on cell 2.

The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 8 s.

The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%.

NOTE:

The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as: T~evaluateFDD~ + T~SI~,
where:

T~evaluateFDD~ See Table 4.1 in section 4.2.2.

T~SI~ Maximum repetition rate of relevant system info blocks that needs
to be received by the UE to camp on a cell. 1280 ms is assumed in this
test case.

This gives a total of 7.68 s, allow 8s in the test case.

##### A.4.2.3.2.2 1.28 Mcps TDD option

The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 2, and starts to
send preambles on the PRACH for sending the RRC CONNECTION REQUEST
message to perform a Location Registration on cell 2.

The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 8 s.

The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%.

NOTE: The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as:

T~evaluateFDD~ + T~SI~

where:

T~evaluateFDD~ A DRX cycle length of 1280ms is assumed for this test
case, this leads to a T~evaluate\ FDD~ of 6.4s according to Table 4.1A
in section 4.2.

T~SI~ Time required for receiving all the relevant system information
data according to the reception procedure and the RRC procedure delay of
system information blocks defined in 25.331 for a UTRAN cell (ms). 1280
ms is assumed in this test case.

This gives a total of 7.68 s, allow 8s in the test case.

##### A.4.2.3.2.3 7.68 Mcps TDD option

The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 2, and starts to
send preambles on the PRACH for sending the RRC CONNECTION REQUEST
message to perform a Location Registration on cell 2.

The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 8 s.

The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%.

NOTE:

The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as:

T~evaluateFDD~ + T~SI~, where:

T~evaluateFDD~ A DRX cycle length of 1280ms is assumed for this test
case, this leads to a T~evaluate\ FDD~ of 6.4s according to Table 4.1B
in section 4.2.

T~SI~ Maximum repetition rate of relevant system info blocks that needs
to be received by the UE to camp on a cell. 1280 ms is assumed in this
test case.

### A.4.2.4 Scenario 4: inter RAT cell re-selection

#### A.4.2.4.1 Test Purpose and Environment

##### A.4.2.4.1.1 3.84 Mcps TDD option

This test is to verify the requirement for the UTRA TDD to GSM cell
re-selection delay reported in section 4.2.

This scenario implies the presence of 1 UTRA TDD serving cell, and 1 GSM
cell to be re-selected. The UE is requested to monitor neighbouring
cells on 1 UTRA TDD carrier and 12 GSM cells. Test parameters are given
in Table, A.4.7, A.4.8, A.4.9. Cell 1 and Cell 2 shall belong to
different Location Areas.

For this test environment the ranking/mapping function indicated in the
broadcast of cell 1 shall be in such a way as to enable the UE to
evaluate that the TDD cell 1 is better ranked as the GSM cell 2 during
T1 and the GSM cell 2 is better ranked than the TDD cell 1 during T2.

##### A.4.2.4.1.3 7.68 Mcps TDD option

This test is to verify the requirement for the UTRA TDD to GSM cell
re-selection delay reported in section 4.2.

This scenario implies the presence of 1 UTRA TDD serving cell, and 1 GSM
cell to be re-selected. The UE is requested to monitor neighbouring
cells on 1 UTRA TDD carrier and 12 GSM cells. Test parameters are given
in Table, A.4.7B, A.4.8B, A.4.9B. Cell 1 and Cell 2 shall belong to
different Location Areas.

For this test environment the ranking/mapping function indicated in the
broadcast of cell 1 shall be in such a way as to enable the UE to
evaluate that the TDD cell 1 is better ranked as the GSM cell 2 during
T1 and the GSM cell 2 is better ranked than the TDD cell 1 during T2.

#### A.4.2.4.2 Test Requirements

##### A.4.2.4.2.1 3.84 Mpcs TDD option

The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 2, and starts to
send the RR Channel Request message for location update to Cell 2.

The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 26 s + T~BCCH~, where
T~BCCH~ is the maximum time allowed to read BCCH data in the GSM cell
\[21\].

The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%.

NOTE: The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as:

4 \* T~measureGSM~ + T~BCCH~

where:

T~measureGSM~ Equal to the value specified in Table 4.1 in section 4.2

T~BCCH~ Equal to 1.9 s, i.e. the maximum time allowed to read BCCH data
when synchronised to a BCCH carrier from a GSM cell \[21\].

This gives a total of 25.6 s + T~BCCH~, allow 26 s + T~BCCH~ in the test
case.

##### A.4.2.4.2.2 1.28 Mpcs TDD option

The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 2, and starts to
send RR Channel Request message to perform a Location update.

The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 8 s + T~BCCH~ where
T~BCCH~ is the maximum time allowed to read BCCH data from GSM cell
\[21\].

The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%.

NOTE: The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as:

Max(3\*T~measureNTDD~ , T~measure\ GSM~ +1DRX)+ T~BCCH~

where:

T~measureNTDD~ A DRX cycle length of 1280ms is assumed for this test
case, this leads to a T~measureNTDD~ of 1.28s according to Table 4.1A in
section 4.2.

T~measureGSM~ A DRX cycle length of 1280ms is assumed for this test
case, this leads to a T~measureGSM~ of 6.4s according to Table 4.1A in
section 4.2.

DRX cycle length 1.28s is assumed, see Table A.4.1A

T~BCCH~ Maximum time allowed to read BCCH data from GSM cell \[20\].

According to \[21\], the maximum time allowed to read the BCCH data,
when being synchronized to a BCCH carrier, is 1.9 s.

This gives a total of 7.68s +T~BCCH~, thus allow 8s +T~BCCH.~

##### A.4.2.4.2.3 7.68 Mpcs TDD option

The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 2, and starts to
send the RR Channel Request message for location update to Cell 2.

The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 26 s + T~BCCH~, where
T~BCCH~ is the maximum time allowed to read BCCH data in the GSM cell
\[21\].

The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%.

NOTE: The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as:

4 \* T~measureGSM~ + T~BCCH~

where:

T~measureGSM~ Equal to the value specified in Table 4.1B in section 4.2

T~BCCH~ Equal to 1.9 s, i.e. the maximum time allowed to read BCCH data
when synchronised to a BCCH carrier from a GSM cell \[21\].

This gives a total of 25.6 s + T~BCCH~, allow 26 s + T~BCCH~ in the test
case.

The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 2, and starts to
send RR Channel Request message for location update to Cell 2.

The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 26 s+ T~BCCH~, where
T~BCCH~ is the maximum time allowed to read BCCH data from GSM cell
\[21\].

The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%.

NOTE: The UE shall keep a running average of 4 measurements, thus gives
4\* T~measureGSM~ +T~BCCH~, where:

T~measureGSM~ A DRX cycle length of 1280ms is assumed for this test
case, this leads to a T~measureGSM~ of 6.4s according to Table 4.1A in
section 4.2.

T~BCCH~ Maximum time allowed to read BCCH data from GSM cell \[21\].

According to \[21\], the maximum time allowed to read the BCCH data,
when being synchronized to a BCCH carrier, is 1.9 s.

This gives a total of 25.6s +T~BCCH~, thus allow 26s +T~BCCH.~

The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from when the cell
quality levels change to the moment when this change makes the UE
reselect a cell, and starts to send LOCATION UPDATING REQUEST message to
perform a Location update to the new cell.

The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 37.7 s+ T~BCCH~, where
T~BCCH~ is the maximum time allowed to read BCCH data from GSM cell.

The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%.

NOTE: The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as: 30 s +
T~measureGSM~ + DRX cycle length + T~BCCH~, where::

T~measureGSM~ A DRX cycle length of 1280ms is assumed for this test
case, this leads to a T~measureGSM~ of 6.4s according to Table 4.1A in
section 4.2.

DRX cycle length A DRX cycle length of 1280ms is assumed for this test
case.

T~BCCH~ Maximum time allowed to read BCCH data from GSM cell.

The maximum time allowed to read the BCCH data, when being synchronized
to a BCCH carrier, is 1.9 s.

This gives a total of 37.68 s +T~BCCH~, thus allow 37.7 s +T~BCCH.~

###### A.4.2.5.1.1.1 3.84 Mcps TDD option

###### A.4.2.5.1.1.2 1.28 Mcps TDD option

This test is to verify the requirement for the UTRA TDD to E-UTRA TDD
inter-RAT cell re-selection requirements specified in section 4.2.2.5a
when the E-UTRA cell is of higher priority.

This test scenario comprised of 1 UTRA TDD serving cell, and 1 E-UTRA
TDD cell to be re-selected. Test parameters are given in table
A.4.2.5.1.1.2-1, A.4.2.5.1.1.2-2, and A.4.2.5.1.1.2-3. The test consists
of three successive time periods, with time duration of T1, T2 and T3
respectively. UTRA cell 1 is already identified by the UE prior to the
start of the test. At T1 the UE is camped on to cell 1. Cell 2 is of
higher priority than cell 1.

The ranking of the cells shall be made according to the cell reselection
criteria specified in TS25.304.

###### A.4.2.5.1.2.1 3.84 Mpcs TDD option

###### A.4.2.5.1.2.2 1.28 Mpcs TDD option

The cell reselection delay to higher priority is defined as the time
from the beginning of time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on
cell 2, and starts to send preambles on the PRACH for sending the RRC
CONNECTION REQUEST message on cell 2.

The cell re-selection delay to higher priority shall be less than 81s.

The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%.

NOTE: The cell re-selection delay to higher priority cell can be
expressed as: **T**~higher\_priority\_search~ + T~evaluateE-UTRA~ +
T~SI~,

Where:

> **T**~higher\_priority\_search~ **60s, See section 4.2.2.5a**
>
> T~evaluateE-UTRA~ 19.2s, See Table 4.2A in section 4.2.2.7
>
> T~SI~ Maximum repetition period of relevant system info blocks that
> needs to be received by the UE to camp on a cell; 1280 ms is assumed
> in this test case.

This gives a total of 80.48 s, allow 81 s for higher priority cell
reselection in the test case.

###### A.4.2.5.2.1.1 3.84 Mcps TDD option

###### A.4.2.5.2.1.2 1.28 Mcps TDD option

This test is to verify the requirement for the UTRA TDD to E-UTRA TDD
inter-RAT cell re-selection requirements specified in section 4.2.2.5a
when the E-UTRA cell is of lower priority.

This test scenario comprised of 1 UTRA TDD serving cell, and 1 E-UTRA
TDD cell to be re-selected. Test parameters are given in table
A.4.2.5.2.1.2-1, A.4.2.5.2.1.2-2, and A.4.2.5.2.1.2-3. The test consists
of two successive time periods, with time duration of T1 and T2
respectively. At T1 the UE is camped on to cell 1. Cell 2 is of lower
priority than cell 1.

The ranking of the cells shall be made according to the cell reselection
criteria specified in TS25.304.

The cell reselection delay to lower priority is defined as the time from
the beginning of time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on cell
2, and starts to send preambles on the PRACH for sending the RRC
CONNECTION REQUEST message on cell 2.

The cell re-selection delay to lower priority shall be less than 21s.

The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%.

NOTE: The cell re-selection delay to lower priority cell can be
expressed as: T~evaluateE-UTRA~ + T~SI~,

Where:

> T~evaluateE-UTRA~ 19.2s, See Table 4.2A in section 4.2.2.7
>
> T~SI~ Maximum repetition period of relevant system info blocks that
> needs to be received by the UE to camp on a cell; 1280 ms is assumed
> in this test case.

This gives a total of 20.48 s, allow 21 s for lower priority cell
reselection in the test case.

####  A.5.1.1.1 Handover to intra-frequency cell

##### A.5.1.1.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify the requirement for the
intra-frequency handover delay in CELL\_DCH state in the single carrier
case reported in section 5.1.2.1.

The test parameters are given in Table A.5.1.1 and A.5.1.2 below. In the
measurement control information it is indicated to the UE that
event-triggered reporting with Event 1G shall be used, and that P-CCPCH
RSCP and SFN-CFN observed timed difference shall be reported together
with Event 1G. The test consists of three successive time periods, with
a time duration of T1, T2 and T3 respectively. At the start of time
duration T1, the UE may not have any timing information of cell 2.

UTRAN shall send a Physical Channel reconfiguration message with
activation time \"now\" with a new active cell, cell 2. The Physical
Channel reconfiguration message shall be sent to the UE during period
T2, after the UE has reported event 1G. The starting point of T3 is
definied as the end of the last TTI containing the physical channel
reconfiguration message.

The second Beacon timeslot shall be provided in timeslot 8 for both cell
1 and cell 2. The UL DPCH shall be transmitted in timeslot 12.

##### A.5.1.1.1.2 Test Requirements

The UE shall start to transmit the UL DPCH to Cell 2 less than 160 ms
from the beginning of time period T3.

The rate of correct handovers observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

#### A.5.1.1.2 Handover to inter-frequency cell 

##### A.5.1.1.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify the requirement for the
inter-frequency handover delay in CELL\_DCH state in the dual carrier
case reported in section 5.1.2.1.

The test consists of two successive time periods, with a time duration
T1 and T2. The test parameters are given in tables A.5.1.3 and A.5.1.4
below. In the measurement control information it is indicated to the UE
that event-triggered reporting with Event 2C shall be used. The PCCPCH
RSCP and SFN-CFN observed time difference of the best cell on the unused
frequency shall be reported together with Event 2C reporting. At the
start of time duration T1, the UE may not have any timing information of
cell 2.

UTRAN shall send a Physical Channel reconfiguration message with
activation time \"now\" with one active cell, cell 2. The Physical
Channel reconfiguration message shall be sent to the UE during period
T2, after the UE has reported event 2C. The starting point of T3 is
defined as the end of the last TTI containing the physical channel
reconfiguration message.

The second Beacon timeslot shall be provided in timeslot 8 for cell 1
and in timeslot 10 for cell 2. The UL DPCH shall be transmitted in
timeslot 12.

##### A.5.1.1.2.2 Test Requirements

The UE shall start to transmit the UL DPCH to Cell 2 less than 160 ms
from the beginning of time period T2.

The rate of correct handovers observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

### A.5.1.2 1.28Mcps TDD option

#### A.5.1.2.1 Handover to intra-frequency cell

##### A.5.1.2.1.1 Scenario 1

This test case is applicable for UE handovers in single frequency
network and UE handovers from primary frequency to primary frequency in
multi-frequency network.

###### A.5.1.2.1.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify the requirement for the
intra-frequency handover delay in CELL\_DCH state in the case as
reported in section 5.1.2.1.2.

The test parameters are given in Table A.5.1.5 and A.5.1.6 below. In the
measurement control information it is indicated to the UE that
event-triggered reporting with Event 1G shall be used, and that PCCPCH
RSCP and SFN-CFN observed timed difference shall be reported together
with Event 1G. The test consists of three successive time periods, with
a time duration of T1, T2 and T3 respectively. At the start of time
duration T1, the UE may not have any timing information of cell 2.

UTRAN shall send a Physical Channel reconfiguration with activation time
\"now\" at the beginning of T3 with a new active cell, cell 2. The
Physical Channel reconfiguration message shall be sent to the UE during
period T2, after the UE has reported event 1G. The starting point of T3
is defined as the end of the last TTI containing the physical channel
reconfiguration message.

###### A.5.1.2.1.1.2 Test Requirements

The UE shall start to transmit the UL DPCH to cell 2 less than 160 ms
from the beginning of time period T3.

The rate of correct handovers observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

##### A.5.1.2.1.2 Scenario 2

This test case is applicable for UE handovers from secondarhy frequency
to parimary frequency in the case of multi-frequency network.

###### A.5.1.2.1.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify the requirement for the
intra-frequency handover delay in CELL\_DCH state in the case as
reported in section 5.1.2.1.2.

The test parameters are given in Table A.5.1.5A and A.5.1.6A below. In
the measurement control information it is indicated to the UE that
event-triggered reporting with Event 1G shall be used, and that PCCPCH
RSCP and SFN-CFN observed timed difference shall be reported together
with Event 1G. The test consists of three successive time periods, with
a time duration of T1, T2 and T3 respectively. At the start of time
duration T1, the UE may not have any timing information of cell 2.

UTRAN shall send a Physical Channel reconfiguration with activation time
\"now\" at the beginning of T3 with a new active cell, cell 2. The
Physical Channel reconfiguration message shall be sent to the UE during
period T2, after the UE has reported event 1G. The starting point of T3
is defined as the end of the last TTI containing the physical channel
reconfiguration message.

This test case is applicable for UE handovers in single frequency
network and UE handovers from primary frequency to the primary frequency
in multi-frequency network.

###### A.5.1.2.2.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify the requirement for the
inter-frequency handover delay in CELL\_DCH in the case as reported in
section 5.1.2.1.2.

The test consists of three successive time periods, with a time duration
T1, T2 and T3. The test parameters are given in tables A.5.1.7 and
A.5.1.8 below. In the measurement control information it is indicated to
the UE that event-triggered reporting with Event 2C shall be used. The
PCCPCH RSCP and SFN-CFN observed timed difference of the best cell on
the unused frequency shall be reported together with Event 2C reporting.
At the start of time duration T1, the UE may not have any timing
information of cell 2.

UTRAN shall send a Physical Channel reconfiguration with activation time
\"now\" with a new active cell, cell 2. The Physical Channel
reconfiguration message shall be sent to the UE during period T2, after
the UE has reported event 2C. The starting point of T3 is defined as the
end of the last TTI containing the physical channel reconfiguration
message.

###### A.5.1.2.2.1.2 Test Requirements

The UE shall start to transmit the UL DPCH to cell 2 less than 160 ms
from the beginning of time period T3.

The rate of correct handovers observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

##### A.5.1.2.2.2 Scenario 2 

This test case is applicable for UE handovers from secondarhy frequency
to parimary frequency in the case of multi-frequency network.

###### A.5.1.2.2.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify the requirement for the
inter-frequency handover delay in CELL\_DCH in the case as reported in
section 5.1.2.1.2.

The test consists of three successive time periods, with a time duration
T1, T2 and T3. The test parameters are given in tables A.5.1.7A and
A.5.1.8A below. In the measurement control information it is indicated
to the UE that event-triggered reporting with Event 2C shall be used.
The PCCPCH RSCP and SFN-CFN observed timed difference of the best cell
on the unused frequency shall be reported together with Event 2C
reporting. At the start of time duration T1, the UE may not have any
timing information of cell 2.

UTRAN shall send a Physical Channel reconfiguration with activation time
\"now\" with a new active cell, cell 2. The Physical Channel
reconfiguration message shall be sent to the UE during period T2, after
the UE has reported event 2C. The starting point of T3 is defined as the
end of the last TTI containing the physical channel reconfiguration
message.

###### A.5.1.2.2.2.2 Test Requirements

The UE shall start to transmit the UL DPCH to cell 2 less than 160 ms
from the beginning of time period T3.

The rate of correct handovers observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

#### A.5.1.2.3 Handover to inter-band cell

##### A.5.1.2.3.1 Scenario 1

This test case is applicable for UE handovers from primary frequency to
the primary frequency in multi-band frequency network.

###### A.5.1.2.3.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify the requirement for the inter-band
handover delay in CELL\_DCH in the case as reported in section
5.1.2.1.2.

The test consists of three successive time periods, with a time duration
T1, T2 and T3. The test parameters are given in tables A.5.1.8A and
A.5.1.8B below. In the measurement control information it is indicated
to the UE that event-triggered reporting with Event 2C shall be used.
The PCCPCH RSCP and SFN-CFN observed timed difference of the best cell
on the unused frequency shall be reported together with Event 2C
reporting. At the start of time duration T1, the UE may not have any
timing information of cell 2.

UTRAN shall send a Physical Channel reconfiguration with activation time
\"now\" with a new active cell, cell 2. The Physical Channel
reconfiguration message shall be sent to the UE during period T2, after
the UE has reported event 2C. The starting point of T3 is defined as the
end of the last TTI containing the physical channel reconfiguration
message.

###### A.5.1.2.3.1.2 Test Requirements

The UE shall start to transmit the UL DPCH to cell 2 less than 160 ms
from the beginning of time period T3.

The rate of correct handovers observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

##### A.5.1.2.3.2 Scenario 2

This test case is applicable for UE handovers from primary frequency to
secondary frequency in multi-band network.

###### A.5.1.2.3.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify the requirement for the
inter-frequency handover delay in CELL\_DCH in the case as reported in
section 5.1.2.1.2.

In cell 1, the primary frequency uses frequency b of band a, and the
secondary frequency uses frequencies a and c of band a. In cell 2, the
primary frequency uses frequency e of band a, and the secondary
frequency uses frequencies d and f of band f.

The test consists of three successive time periods, with a time duration
T1, T2 and T3. The test parameters are given in tables A.5.1.8C and
A.5.1.8D below. In the measurement control information it is indicated
to the UE that event-triggered reporting with Event 2C shall be used.
The PCCPCH RSCP and SFN-CFN observed timed difference of the best cell
on the unused frequency shall be reported together with Event 2C
reporting. At the start of time duration T1, the UE may not have any
timing information of cell 2.

UTRAN shall send a Physical Channel reconfiguration with activation time
\"now\" with a new active cell, cell 2. The Physical Channel
reconfiguration message shall be sent to the UE during period T2, after
the UE has reported event 2C. The starting point of T3 is defined as the
end of the last TTI containing the physical channel reconfiguration
message.

###### A.5.1.2.3.2.2 Test Requirements

The UE shall start to transmit the UL DPCH to cell 2 less than 160 ms
from the beginning of time period T3.

The rate of correct handovers observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

A.5.1.2.3.3 Scenario 3

This test case is applicable for UE handovers from secondary frequency
to secondary frequency in multi-band network.

A.5.1.2.3.3.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify the requirement for the
inter-frequency handover delay in CELL\_DCH in the case as reported in
section 5.1.2.1.2.

In cell 1, the primary frequency uses frequency e of band a, and the
secondary frequency uses frequencies d and f of band f. In cell 2, the
primary frequency uses frequency b of band a, and the secondary
frequency uses frequencies a and c of band a.

The test consists of three successive time periods, with a time duration
T1, T2 and T3. The test parameters are given in tables A.5.1.8E and
A.5.1.8F below. In the measurement control information it is indicated
to the UE that event-triggered reporting with Event 2C shall be used.
The PCCPCH RSCP and SFN-CFN observed timed difference of the best cell
on the unused frequency shall be reported together with Event 2C
reporting. At the start of time duration T1, the UE may not have any
timing information of cell 2.

UTRAN shall send a Physical Channel reconfiguration with activation time
\"now\" with a new active cell, cell 2. The Physical Channel
reconfiguration message shall be sent to the UE during period T2, after
the UE has reported event 2C. The starting point of T3 is defined as the
end of the last TTI containing the physical channel reconfiguration
message.

A.5.1.2.3.3.2 Test Requirements

The UE shall start to transmit the UL DPCH to cell 2 less than 160 ms
from the beginning of time period T3.

The rate of correct handovers observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

### A.5.1.3 7.68Mcps TDD option

####  A.5.1.3.1 Handover to intra-frequency cell

##### A.5.1.3.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify the requirement for the
intra-frequency handover delay in CELL\_DCH state in the single carrier
case reported in section 5.1.2.1.

The test parameters are given in Table A.5.1.9 and A.5.1.10 below. In
the measurement control information it is indicated to the UE that
event-triggered reporting with Event 1G shall be used, and that P-CCPCH
RSCP and SFN-CFN observed timed difference shall be reported together
with Event 1G. The test consists of three successive time periods, with
a time duration of T1, T2 and T3 respectively. At the start of time
duration T1, the UE may not have any timing information of cell 2.

UTRAN shall send a Physical Channel reconfiguration message with
activation time \"now\" with a new active cell, cell 2. The Physical
Channel reconfiguration message shall be sent to the UE during period
T2, after the UE has reported event 1G. The starting point of T3 is
definied as the end of the last TTI containing the physical channel
reconfiguration message.

The second Beacon timeslot shall be provided in timeslot 8 for both cell
1 and cell 2. The UL DPCH shall be transmitted in timeslot 12.

##### A.5.1.3.1.2 Test Requirements

The UE shall start to transmit the UL DPCH to Cell 2 less than 160 ms
from the beginning of time period T3.

The rate of correct handovers observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

#### A.5.1.3.2 Handover to inter-frequency cell 

##### A.5.1.3.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify the requirement for the
inter-frequency handover delay in CELL\_DCH state in the dual carrier
case reported in section 5.1.2.1.

The test consists of two successive time periods, with a time duration
T1 and T2. The test parameters are given in tables A.5.1.11 and A.5.1.12
below. In the measurement control information it is indicated to the UE
that event-triggered reporting with Event 2C shall be used. The PCCPCH
RSCP and SFN-CFN observed time difference of the best cell on the unused
frequency shall be reported together with Event 2C reporting. At the
start of time duration T1, the UE may not have any timing information of
cell 2.

UTRAN shall send a Physical Channel reconfiguration message with
activation time \"now\" with one active cell, cell 2. The Physical
Channel reconfiguration message shall be sent to the UE during period
T2, after the UE has reported event 2C. The starting point of T3 is
defined as the end of the last TTI containing the physical channel
reconfiguration message.

The second Beacon timeslot shall be provided in timeslot 8 for cell 1
and in timeslot 10 for cell 2. The UL DPCH shall be transmitted in
timeslot 12.

##### A.5.1.3.2.2 Test Requirements

The UE shall start to transmit the UL DPCH to Cell 2 less than 160 ms
from the beginning of time period T2.

The rate of correct handovers observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

A.5.2 TDD/FDD Handover
----------------------

### A.5.2.1 3.84 Mcps TDD option

#### A.5.2.1.1 Test purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify the requirement for the TDD/FDD
handover delay in CELL\_DCH state reported in section 5.2.2.1.

The test parameters are given in Table A.5.2.1, A.5.2.2 and A.5.2.3
below. In the measurement control information it is indicated to the UE
that event-triggered reporting with Event 1G and 2B shall be used. The
CPICH\_RSCP of the best cell on the unused frequency shall be reported
together with Event 2B reporting. The test consists of three successive
time periods, with a time duration of T1, T2 and T3 respectively. At the
start of time duration T1, the UE may not have any timing information of
cell 2.

UTRAN shall send a Physical Channel reconfiguration message with
activation time \"now\" with a new active cell, cell 2. The Physical
Channel reconfiguration message shall be sent to the UE during period
T2, after the UE has reported event 2B. The starting point of T3 is
defined as the end of the last TTI containing the physical channel
reconfiguration message.

#### A.5.2.1.2 Test Requirements

The UE shall start to transmit the UL DPCCH to Cell 2 less than 220 ms
from the beginning of time period T3.

The rate of correct handovers observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

### A.5.2.2 1.28 Mcps TDD option

#### A.5.2.2.1 Test purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify the requirement for the TDD/FDD
handover delay in CELL\_DCH state reported in section 5.2.2.2.

The test parameters are given in Table A.5.2.4, A.5.2.5 and A.5.2.6
below. In the measurement control information it is indicated to the UE
that event-triggered reporting with Event 1G and 2B shall be used. The
CPICH\_RSCP of the best cell on the unused frequency shall be reported
together with Event 2B reporting. The test consists of three successive
time periods, with a time duration of T1, T2 and T3 respectively. At the
start of time duration T1, the UE may not have any timing information of
cell 2.

UTRAN shall send a Physical Channel reconfiguration message with
activation time \"now\" with a new active cell, cell 2. The Physical
Channel reconfiguration message shall be sent to the UE during period
T2, after the UE has reported event 2B. The starting point of T3 is
defined as the end of the last TTI containing the physical channel
reconfiguration message.

#### A.5.2.2.2 Test Requirements

The UE shall start to transmit the UL DPCCH to Cell 2 less than 220 ms
from the beginning of time period T3.

The rate of correct handovers observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

### A.5.2.3 7.68 Mcps TDD option

#### A.5.2.3.1 Test purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify the requirement for the TDD/FDD
handover delay in CELL\_DCH state reported in section 5.2.2.1.

The test parameters are given in Table A.5.2.7, A.5.2.8 and A.5.2.9
below. In the measurement control information it is indicated to the UE
that event-triggered reporting with Event 1G and 2B shall be used. The
CPICH\_RSCP of the best cell on the unused frequency shall be reported
together with Event 2B reporting. The test consists of three successive
time periods, with a time duration of T1, T2 and T3 respectively. At the
start of time duration T1, the UE may not have any timing information of
cell 2.

UTRAN shall send a Physical Channel reconfiguration message with
activation time \"now\" with a new active cell, cell 2. The Physical
Channel reconfiguration message shall be sent to the UE during period
T2, after the UE has reported event 2B. The starting point of T3 is
defined as the end of the last TTI containing the physical channel
reconfiguration message.

#### A.5.2.3.2 Test Requirements

The UE shall start to transmit the UL DPCCH to Cell 2 less than 220 ms
from the beginning of time period T3.

The rate of correct handovers observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

A.5.3 TDD/GSM Handover
----------------------

### A.5.3.1 Test Purpose and Environment

#### A.5.3.1.1 3.84 Mcps TDD option

The purpose of this test is to verify the requirement for the UTRA TDD
to GSM handover delay reported in section 5.4.2.1.

The test parameters are given in Tables A.5.3.1, A.5.3.2 and A.5.3.3
below. In the measurement control information it is indicated to the UE
that event-triggered reporting with Event 3C shall be used. The test
consists of three successive time periods, with a time duration of T1,
T2 and T3 respectively. At the start of time duration T1, the UE may not
have any timing information of cell 2.

UTRAN shall send a HANDOVER FROM UTRAN COMMAND message with activation
time \"now\" with one active cell, cell 2. The HANDOVER FROM UTRAN
COMMAND message shall be sent to the UE during period T2. The starting
point of T3 is defined as the end of the last TTI containing the HO
command. In the GSM Handover command contained in this message, IE
starting time shall not be included.

Cell 1 is a UTRA TDD cell and cell 2 is a GSM cell. The Beacon timeslot
shall be transmitted in timeslot 0 for cell 1 and no second Beacon
timeslot shall be provided for cell 1. The DL DPCH shall be transmitted
in timeslot 1 and the UL DPCH shall be transmitted in timeslot 3.

#### A.5.3.1.2 1.28Mcps TDD option

The purpose of this test is to verify the requirement for the UTRA TDD
to GSM handover delay reported in section 5.3.2.

The test parameters are given in Tables A.5.3.4, A.5.3.5 and A.5.3.6
below. In the measurement control information it is indicated to the UE
that event-triggered reporting with Event 3C shall be used. The test
consists of three successive time periods, with a time duration of T1,
T2 and T3 respectively. At the start of time duration T1, the UE may not
have any timing information of cell 2.

UTRAN shall send a HANDOVER FROM UTRAN COMMAND message with activation
time \"now\" with one active cell, cell 2. The HANDOVER FROM UTRAN
COMMAND message shall be sent to the UE during period T2. The starting
point of T3 is defined as the end of the last TTI containing the HO
command. In the GSM Handover command contained in this message, the IE
starting time shall not be included.

Cell 1 is a UTRA TDD cell and cell 2 is a GSM cell.

The DL DPCH shall be transmitted in timeslot 4 and the UL DPCH shall be
transmitted in timeslot 2.

#### A.5.3.1.3 7.68 Mcps TDD option

The purpose of this test is to verify the requirement for the UTRA TDD
to GSM handover delay reported in section 5.4.2.1.

The test parameters are given in Tables A.5.3.7, A.5.3.8 and A.5.3.9
below. In the measurement control information it is indicated to the UE
that event-triggered reporting with Event 3C shall be used. The test
consists of three successive time periods, with a time duration of T1,
T2 and T3 respectively. At the start of time duration T1, the UE may not
have any timing information of cell 2.

UTRAN shall send a HANDOVER FROM UTRAN COMMAND message with activation
time \"now\" with one active cell, cell 2. The HANDOVER FROM UTRAN
COMMAND message shall be sent to the UE during period T2. The starting
point of T3 is defined as the end of the last TTI containing the HO
command. In the GSM Handover command contained in this message, IE
starting time shall not be included.

Cell 1 is a UTRA TDD cell and cell 2 is a GSM cell. The Beacon timeslot
shall be transmitted in timeslot 0 for cell 1 and no second Beacon
timeslot shall be provided for cell 1. The DL DPCH shall be transmitted
in timeslot 1 and the UL DPCH shall be transmitted in timeslot 3.

A.5.3a TDD to E-UTRA FDD Handover
---------------------------------

### A.5.3a.1 Test Purpose and Environment

#### A.5.3a.1.1 3.84 Mcps TDD option

#### A.5.3a.1.2 1.28 Mcps TDD option

This test is to verify the requirement for UTRAN TDD to E-UTRAN FDD
handover requirements specified in section 5.3a.

The test scenario comprises of 1 UTRA TDD cell and 1 E-UTRA FDD cell as
given in tables Table A.5.3a.1.2-1, Table A.5.3a.1.2-2, and Table
A.5.3a.1.2-3. Idle interval of 80ms period as defined in TS25.331 is
configured before T2 begins to enable E-UTRAN monitoring.

The test consists of three successive time periods, with time durations
of T1, T2 and T3 respectively.

A RRC message implying handover shall be sent to the UE during period
T2, after the UE has reported Event 3a. The end of the last TTI
containing handover message is begin of T3 duration.

---------------------------------

### A.5.3b.1 Test Purpose and Environment

#### A.5.3b.1.1 3.84 Mcps TDD option

#### A.5.3b.1.2 1.28 Mcps TDD option

This test is to verify the requirement for UTRAN TDD to E-UTRAN TDD
handover requirements specified in section 5.3b.

The test scenario comprises of 1 UTRA TDD cell and 1 E-UTRA TDD cell as
given in tables Table A.5.3b.1.2-1, Table A.5.3b.1.2-2, and Table
A.5.3b.1.2-3. Idle interval of 80ms period as defined in TS25.331 is
configured before T2 begins to enable E-UTRAN monitoring.

The test consists of three successive time periods, with time durations
of T1, T2 and T3 respectively.

A RRC message implying handover shall be sent to the UE during period
T2, after the UE has reported Event 3a. The end of the last TTI
containing handover message is begin of T3 duration.

#### A.5.3b.2.2 1.28 Mcps TDD option

The UE shall start to transmit the PRACH to Cell 2 less than 80 ms from
the beginning of time period T3.

A.5.3c UTRA TDD to E-UTRA FDD handover: unknown target cell
-----------------------------------------------------------

### A.5.3c.1 Test Purpose and Environment

#### A.5.3c.1.1 3.84 Mcps TDD option

#### A.5.3c.1.2 1.28 Mcps TDD option

This test is to verify the requirement for UTRAN TDD to E-UTRAN FDD
handover requirements specified in section 5.3a when the target E-UTRAN
cell is unknown.

The test scenario comprises of 1 UTRA TDD cell and 1 E-UTRA FDD cell as
given in tables A.5.3c.1.2-1, A.5.3c.1.2-2, and A.5.3c.1.2-3. No
scheduled idle interval is configured in the test case.

The test consists of two successive time periods, with time durations of
T1 and T2 respectively. During time duration T1, a RRC HANDOVER FROM
UTRAN COMMAND message shall be sent to the UE with activation time
\"now\" with a new active E-UTRA FDD cell, cell2. The end of the last
TTI containing handover message is the beginning of T2 duration. At the
start of time duration T2, the UE does not have any timing information
of Cell 2.

A.5.3d UTRA TDD to E-UTRA TDD handover: unknown target cell
-----------------------------------------------------------

### A.5.3d.1 Test Purpose and Environment

#### A.5.3d.1.1 3.84 Mcps TDD option

#### A.5.3d.1.2 1.28 Mcps TDD option

This test is to verify the requirement for UTRAN TDD to E-UTRAN TDD
handover requirements specified in section 5.3b when the target E-UTRAN
cell is unknown.

The test scenario comprises of 1 UTRA TDD cell and 1 E-UTRA TDD cell as
given in tables A.5.3d.1.2-1, A.5.3d.1.2-2, and A.5.3d.1.2-3. No
scheduled idle interval is configured in the test case.

The test consists of two successive time periods, with time durations of
T1 and T2 respectively. During time duration T1, a RRC HANDOVER FROM
UTRAN COMMAND message shall be sent to the UE with activation time
\"now\" with a new active E-UTRA TDD cell, cell2. The end of the last
TTI containing handover message is the beginning of T2 duration. At the
start of time duration T2, the UE does not have any timing information
of Cell 2.

#### A.5.3e.1.2 1.28Mcps TDD option 

The purpose of this test is to verify the requirement for the UTRA TDD
to GSM handover delay reported in section 5.3.2.

The test parameters are given in Tables A.5.3e.4, A.5.3e.5 and A.5.3e.6
below. The test consists of two successive time periods, with a time
duration of T1 and T2 respectively. At the start of time duration T1,
the UE may not have any timing information of cell 2.

Starting T2, cell 2 becomes detectable and the UE receives a RRC
handover command from the network. The start of T2 is the instant when
the last TTI containing the RRC message implying handover is sent to the
UE.

Cell 1 is a UTRA TDD cell and cell 2 is a GSM cell.

The DL DPCH shall be transmitted in timeslot 4 and the UL DPCH shall be
transmitted in timeslot 2.

### A.5.3e.2 Test Requirements

#### A.5.3e.2.1 3.84 Mcps TDD option

#### A.5.3e.2.2 1.28 Mcps TDD option 

The UE shall begin to send access bursts on the new DCCH of the target
cell less than 200 ms from the beginning of time period T3.

The rate of correct handovers observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

NOTE: The test requirement in this test case is expressed as:

T~Handover\ delay~ = 190 ms + T~offset~ + T~UL~

T~offset~: Equal to 4.65 ms, GSM timing uncertainty between the time
from when the UE is ready to transmit until the start of the next
timeslot in GSM 26 multiframe structure

T~UL~: Equal to 4.65 ms, the time the UE has to wait in case the next
timeslot is an idle frame or a SACCH frame.

This gives a total of 199.3 ms, allow 200 ms in the test case.

> NOTE: S-CCPCH shall not be located in TS0.

##### A.5.4.1.1.2 Test Requirements

The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 2, and starts to
send the CELL UPDATE message with cause value \"cell reselection\" in
cell 2.

The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 2,5 s.

The rate of correct cell re-selections observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%.

#### A.5.4.1.2 Scenario 2: Re-selection to inter-frequency TDD cell

##### A.5.4.1.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify the requirement for the cell
re-selection delay in CELL\_FACH state in the multi carrier case
reported in section 5.4.2.1.2. The test parameters are given in Tables
A.5.4.5 to A.5.4.8.

##### A.5.4.2.1.2 Test Requirements

The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 2, and starts to
send SYNCH-UL sequence in the UpPTS for sending the CELL UPDATE message
with cause value \"cell reselection\" in cell 2.

The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 1.6 s.

The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%.

NOTE:

> The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as:

ms

> where:

T~Measurement\ Period\ Intra~ Specified in 8.4A.2.2.2 gives 200ms for
this test case.

T~SI~ Time required for receiving all the relevant system information
data according to the reception procedure and the RRC procedure delay of
system information blocks defined in 25.331 for a UTRAN cell (ms). 1280
ms is assumed in this test case.

T~RA~ The additional delay caused by the random access procedure
described in TS25.224. In this test case the persistence value is 1 thus
T~RA~ is set to 35ms in the test case.

This gives a total of 1.545s, allow 1.6s in the test case.

##### A.5.4.2.2.2 Test Requirements

The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 2, and starts to
send SYNCH-UL sequence in the UpPTS for sending the CELL UPDATE message
with cause value \"cell reselection\" in cell 2.

The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 2 s.

The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%.

NOTE: The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as:

ms,

where:

T~measurement\ inter~ is specified in 8.4A.2.3.2 gives 480ms for this
test case.

T~SI~ Time required for receiving all the relevant system information
data according to the reception procedure and the RRC procedure delay of
system information blocks defined in 25.331 for a UTRAN cell (ms). 1280
ms is assumed in this test case.

T~RA~ The additional delay caused by the random access procedure
described in TS25.224. In this test case the persistence value is 1 thus
T~RA~ is set to 35ms in the test case.

This gives a total of 1.825s, allow 1.9s in the test case.

#### A.5.4.2.3 Re-selection to GSM cell

##### A.5.4.2.3.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify the requirement for the cell
re-selection delay in CELL\_FACH state in section 5.4.3.2.4.

This scenario implies the presence of 1 UTRAN serving cell, and 1 GSM
cell to be re-selected. The UE is requested to monitor neighbouring
cells on 1 UMTS carrier and 6 GSM cells. Test parameters are given in
Table, A.5.4.16A, A.5.4.16B, A.5.4.16C, A.5.4.16D, A.5.4.16E.

##### A.5.4.2.3.2 Test Requirements

The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from when the cell
quality levels change to the moment when this change makes the UE
reselect a better ranked cell, and starts to send CHANNEL REQUEST
message to perform a Location update to the new cell.

This test is for the case where the UE camps on a 1,28 Mcps TDD cell and
reselects to a GSM cell.

The requirements and this test apply to UEs supporting both 1,28 Mcps
TDD and GSM.

The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 7.5 s.

The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%.

NOTE: T~reselection\ GSM~ = 40 + T~identify\ GSM~ + T~measurement\ GSM~
+ T~BCCH~ + T~RA~， where:

T~RA~ = The additional delay caused by the random access
procedure，10ms.

T~identify\ GSM~ Specified in TS 25.123 ,here it is 5000ms.

T~measureGSM~ 480ms according to Table 4.1A in section 4.2.

T~BCCH~ Maximum time allowed to read BCCH data from GSM cell.

The maximum time allowed to read the BCCH data, when being synchronized
to a BCCH carrier, is 1.9 s.

This gives a total of 7.43s, thus allow 7.5s.

### A.5.4.3 7.68 Mcps TDD option

#### A.5.4.3.1 Scenario 1: TDD/TDD cell re-selection single carrier case

##### A.5.4.3.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify the requirement for the cell
re-selection delay in CELL\_FACH state in the single carrier case
reported in section 5.4.4.1.1. The test parameters are given in Tables
A.5.4.17 to A.5.4.20.

##### A.5.4.3.2.2 Test Requirements

The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 2, and starts to
send the CELL UPDATE message with cause value \"cell reselection\" in
cell 2.

The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 3 s.

The rate of correct cell re-selections observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%.

##### A.5.4A.2.1.2 Test Requirements

The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 2, and starts to
send SYNCH-UL sequence in the UpPTS for sending the CELL UPDATE message
with cause value \"cell reselection\" in cell 2.

The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 1.6 s.

The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%.

NOTE:

The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as:

ms

where:

T~Measurement\ Period\ Intra~ Specified in 8.4A.2.2.2 gives 200ms for
this test case.

T~SI~ Time required for receiving all the relevant system information
data according to the reception procedure and the RRC procedure delay of
system information blocks defined in 25.331 for a UTRAN cell (ms). 1280
ms is assumed in this test case.

T~RA~ The additional delay caused by the random access procedure
described in TS25.224. In this test case the persistence value is 1 thus
T~RA~ is set to 35ms in the test case.

T~CSI~ is the additional delay in case the cell re-selection indication
shall be sent in enhanced CELL\_FACH state. T~CSI~ can be up to one sub
frame (5ms) or the delay caused by the random access procedure (T~RA~).
In this test case the delay is T~RA~ and is set to 35ms in the test
case.

This gives a total of 1.58s, allow 1.6s in the test case.

#### A.5.4A.2.2 Re-selection to inter-frequency TDD cell

##### A.5.4A.2.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify the requirement for the cell
re-selection delay in CELL\_FACH state in section 5.4.3.2.2. The test
parameters are given in Tables A.5.4.27 to A.5.4.28

##### A.5.4A.2.2.2 Test Requirements

The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 2, and starts to
send SYNCH-UL sequence in the UpPTS for sending the CELL UPDATE message
with cause value \"cell reselection\" in cell 2.

The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 1.9 s.

The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%.

NOTE: The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as:

ms,

where:

T~measurement\ inter~ is specified in 8.4A.2.3.2 gives 480ms for this
test case.

T~SI~ Time required for receiving all the relevant system information
data according to the reception procedure and the RRC procedure delay of
system information blocks defined in 25.331 for a UTRAN cell (ms). 1280
ms is assumed in this test case.

T~RA~ The additional delay caused by the random access procedure
described in TS25.224. In this test case the persistence value is 1 thus
T~RA~ is set to 35ms in the test case.

T~CSI~ is the additional delay in case the cell re-selection indication
shall be sent in enhanced CELL\_FACH state. T~CSI~ can be up to one sub
frame (5ms) or the delay caused by the random access procedure (T~RA~).
In this test case the delay is T~RA~ and is set to 35ms in the test
case.

This gives a total of 1.86s, allow 1.9s in the test case.

### A.5.5.1 Scenario 1: Re-selection to intra-frequency TDD cell

#### A.5.5.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment

##### A.5.5.1.1.1 3.84Mcps TDD option

This test is to verify the requirement for the cell re-selection delay
in CELL\_PCH state in section 5.5.2.

This scenario implies the presence of 1 carrier and 6 cells as given in
Table A.5.5.1and A.5.5.2.

#### A.5.5.1.2 Test Requirements

##### A.5.5.1.2.1 for 3.84Mcps TDD option

The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 2, and starts to
send the CELL UPDATE message with cause \"cell reselection\" in cell 2.

The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 8 s.

NOTE:

The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as: T~evaluateTDD~ + T~SI~,
where:

T~evaluateTDD~ A DRX cycle length of 1280ms is assumed for this test
case, this leads to a T~evaluate\ TDD~ of 6.4s according to Table 4.1 in
section 4.2.2.7.

T~SI~ Maximum repetition period of relevant system info blocks that
needs to be received by the UE to camp on a cell. 1280 ms is assumed in
this test case.

This gives a total of 7.68 s, allow 8s in the test case.

##### A.5.5.1.2.2 1.28Mcps TDD option

The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 2, and starts to
send SYNCH-UL sequence in the UpPTS for sending the CELL UPDATE message
with cause \"cell reselection\" in cell 2.

The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 8 s.

The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%.

NOTE: The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as:

T~evaluateNTDD~ + T~SI~

where:

T~evaluateNTDD~: A DRX cycle length of 1280ms is assumed for this test
case, this leads to a T~evaluate\ NTDD~ of 6.4s according to Table 4.1A
in section 4.2.

T~SI~: Time required for receiving all the relevant system information
data according to the reception procedure and the RRC procedure delay of
system information blocks defined in 25.331 for a UTRAN cell (ms). 1280
ms is assumed in this test case.

This gives a total of 7.68 s, allow 8s in the test case.

##### A.5.5.1.2.3 7.68Mcps TDD option

The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 2, and starts to
send the CELL UPDATE message with cause \"cell reselection\" in cell 2.

The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 8 s.

NOTE:

The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as: T~evaluateTDD~ + T~SI~,
where:

T~evaluateTDD~ A DRX cycle length of 1280ms is assumed for this test
case, this leads to a T~evaluate\ TDD~ of 6.4s according to Table 4.1B
in section 4.2.2.7.

T~SI~ Maximum repetition period of relevant system info blocks that
needs to be received by the UE to camp on a cell. 1280 ms is assumed in
this test case.

This gives a total of 7.68 s, allow 8s in the test case.

### A.5.5.2 Scenario 2: Re-selection to inter-frequency TDD cell

##### A.5.5.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment

##### A.5.5.2.1.1 for 3.84Mcps TDD option

This test is to verify the requirement for the cell re-selection delay
in CELL\_PCH state in section 5.5.2.

This scenario implies the presence of 1 carrier and 6 cells as given in
Table A.5.5.5 and A.5.5.6

#### A.5.5.2.2 Test Requirements

##### A.5.5.2.2.1 for 3.84Mcps TDD option

The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 2, and starts to
send the CELL UPDATE message with cause \"cell reselection\" in cell 2.

The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 8 s.

NOTE:

The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as: T~evaluateTDD~ + T~SI~,
where:

T~evaluateTDD~ A DRX cycle length of 1280ms is assumed for this test
case, this leads to a T~evaluate\ TDD~ of 6.4s according to Table 4.1 in
section 4.2.2.7.

T~SI~ Maximum repetition period of relevant system info blocks that
needs to be received by the UE to camp on a cell. 1280 ms is assumed in
this test case.

This gives a total of 7.68 s, allow 8s in the test case.

##### A.5.5.2.2.2 for 1.28Mcps TDD option

The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 2, and starts to
send the SYNCH-UL sequence in the UpPTS for sending the CELL UPDATE
message with cause \"cell reselection\" in cell 2.

The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 8 s.

The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%.

NOTE: The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as:

T~evaluateNTDD~ + T~SI~

where:

T~evaluateNTDD~ A DRX cycle length of 1280ms is assumed for this test
case, this leads to a T~evaluate\ NTDD~ of 6.4s according to Table 4.1A
in section 4.2.

T~SI~ Time required for receiving all the relevant system information
data according to the reception procedure and the RRC procedure delay of
system information blocks defined in 25.331 for a UTRAN cell (ms). 1280
ms is assumed in this test case.

This gives a total of 7.68 s, allow 8s in the test case.

##### A.5.5.2.2.3 for 7.68Mcps TDD option

The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 2, and starts to
send the CELL UPDATE message with cause \"cell reselection\" in cell 2.

The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 8 s.

NOTE:

The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as: T~evaluateTDD~ + T~SI~,
where:

T~evaluateTDD~ A DRX cycle length of 1280ms is assumed for this test
case, this leads to a T~evaluate\ TDD~ of 6.4s according to Table 4.1B
in section 4.2.2.7.

T~SI~ Maximum repetition period of relevant system info blocks that
needs to be received by the UE to camp on a cell. 1280 ms is assumed in
this test case.

This gives a total of 7.68 s, allow 8s in the test case.

### A.5.6.1 Scenario 1: Re-selection to intra-frequency TDD cell

#### A.5.6.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment

##### A.5.6.1.1.1 for 3.84Mcps TDD option

This test is to verify the requirement for the cell re-selection delay
in URA\_PCH state in section 5.6.2.

This scenario implies the presence of 1 carrier and 6 cells as given in
Table A.5.6.1 and A.5.6.2.

Cell1 and Cell2 shall belong to different UTRAN Registration Areas
(URA).

#### A.5.6.1.2 Test Requirements

##### A.5.6.1.2.1 for 3.84Mcps TDD option

The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 2, and starts to
send the URA UPDATE message with URA update cause value \"change of URA
\" in cell 2.

The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 8 s.

NOTE:

The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as: T~evaluateTDD~ + T~SI~,
where:

T~evaluateTDD~ A DRX cycle length of 1280ms is assumed for this test
case, this leads to a T~evaluate\ TDD~ of 6.4s according to Table 4.1 in
section 4.2.2.7.

T~SI~ Maximum repetition period of relevant system info blocks that
needs to be received by the UE to camp on a cell. 1280 ms is assumed in
this test case.

This gives a total of 7.68 s, allow 8s in the test case.

##### A.5.6.1.2.2 for 1.28Mcps TDD option

The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 2, and starts to
send SYNCH-UL sequence in the UpPTS for sending the URA UPDATE message
with URA update cause value \"change of URA\" in cell 2.

The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 8 s.

The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%.

NOTE: The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as:

T~evaluateNTDD~ + T~SI~

where:

T~evaluateNTDD~: A DRX cycle length of 1280ms is assumed for this test
case, this leads to a T~evaluate\ NTDD~ of 6.4s according to Table 4.1A
in section 4.2.

T~SI~: Time required for receiving all the relevant system information
data according to the reception procedure and the RRC procedure delay of
system information blocks defined in 25.331 for a UTRAN cell (ms). 1280
ms is assumed in this test case.

This gives a total of 7.68 s, allow 8s in the test case.

##### A.5.6.1.2.3 for 7.68Mcps TDD option

The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 2, and starts to
send the URA UPDATE message with URA update cause value \"change of URA
\" in cell 2.

The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 8 s.

NOTE:

The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as: T~evaluateTDD~ + T~SI~,
where:

T~evaluateTDD~ A DRX cycle length of 1280ms is assumed for this test
case, this leads to a T~evaluate\ TDD~ of 6.4s according to Table 4.1B
in section 4.2.2.7.

T~SI~ Maximum repetition period of relevant system info blocks that
needs to be received by the UE to camp on a cell. 1280 ms is assumed in
this test case.

This gives a total of 7.68 s, allow 8s in the test case.

### A.5.6.2 Scenario 2: Re-selection to inter-frequency TDD cell

#### A.5.6.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment

##### A.5.6.2.1.1 for 3.84Mcps TDD option

This test is to verify the requirement for the cell re-selection delay
in URA\_PCH state in section 5.6.2.

This scenario implies the presence of 1 carrier and 6 cells as given in
Table A.5.6.5 and A.5.6.6.

##### A.5.6.2.1.2 1.28Mcps TDD option

This test is to verify the requirement for the cell re-selection delay
in URA\_PCH state in section 5.6.2.2.

This scenario implies the presence of 2 carriers and 6 cells as given in
Table A.5.6.7 and A.5.6.8.

Cell1 and Cell2 shall belong to different UTRAN Registration Areas
(URA).

#### A.5.6.2.2 Test Requirements

##### A.5.6.2.2.1 3.84Mcps TDD option

The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 2, and starts to
send the URA UPDATE message with URA update cause \"change of URA \" in
cell 2.

The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 8 s.

NOTE:

The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as: T~evaluateTDD~ + T~SI~,
where:

T~evaluateTDD~ A DRX cycle length of 1280ms is assumed for this test
case, this leads to a T~evaluate\ TDD~ of 6.4s according to Table 4.1 in
section 4.2.2.7.

T~SI~ Maximum repetition period of relevant system info blocks that
needs to be received by the UE to camp on a cell. 1280 ms is assumed in
this test case.

This gives a total of 7.68 s, allow 8s in the test case.

##### A.5.6.2.2.2 1.28Mcps TDD option

The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 2, and starts to
send the SYNCH-UL sequence in the UpPTS for sending the URA UPDATE
message with URA update cause \"change of URA\" in cell 2.

The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 8 s.

The rate of correct cell reselections observed during repeated tests
shall be at least 90%.

NOTE: The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as:

T~evaluateNTDD~ + T~SI~

where:

T~evaluateNTDD~ A DRX cycle length of 1280ms is assumed for this test
case, this leads to a T~evaluate\ NTDD~ of 6.4s according to Table 4.1A
in section 4.2.

T~SI~ Time required for receiving all the relevant system information
data according to the reception procedure and the RRC procedure delay of
system information blocks defined in 25.331 for a UTRAN cell (ms). 1280
ms is assumed in this test case.

This gives a total of 7.68 s, allow 8s in the test case.

##### A.5.6.2.2.3 7.68Mcps TDD option

The cell re-selection delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 2, and starts to
send the URA UPDATE message with URA update cause \"change of URA \" in
cell 2.

The cell re-selection delay shall be less than 8 s.

NOTE:

The cell re-selection delay can be expressed as: T~evaluateTDD~ + T~SI~,
where:

T~evaluateTDD~ A DRX cycle length of 1280ms is assumed for this test
case, this leads to a T~evaluate\ TDD~ of 6.4s according to Table 4.1B
in section 4.2.2.7.

T~SI~ Maximum repetition period of relevant system info blocks that
needs to be received by the UE to camp on a cell. 1280 ms is assumed in
this test case.

This gives a total of 7.68 s, allow 8s in the test case.

### A.5.8.1 Test Purpose and Environment

#### A.5.8.1.1 3.84Mcps TDD option

Void.

#### A.5.8.1.2 1.28Mcps TDD option

The purpose of this test is to verify the requirement for the delay when
performing the Inter-RAT cell change order from UTRAN TDD to GSM(GPRS)
specified in section 5.8.

The test parameters are given in Table A.5.8.1, A.5.8.2, and A.5.8.3
below.

The SS starts the UTRAN cell and brings the UE into PS-DCCH+DTCH\_DCH.
The SS starts GPRS cell, then sends CELL CHANGE ORDER FROM UTRAN
indicating the target cell description, GPRS cell, to the UE through
DCCH of the serving UTRAN cell.

After UE receives the command it shall configure itself accordingly and
switch to the new channel on the target GPRS cell. The SS checks whether
the cell change is performed by checking that the UE receives a
successful response to the CHANNEL REQUEST message from the SS through
GPRS cell.

The test consists of three successive time periods, with a time duration
of T1, T2 and T3 respectively. The UTRAN shall send CELL CHANGE ORDER
FROM UTRAN message. The start of T3 is defined as the end of the last
TTI containing the CELL CHANGE ORDER FROM UTRAN.

least 90% with a confidence level of 95 %.

NOTE: The test requirement in this case is expressed as:

T~CCO\ delay~ = 190ms + T~BCCH~+ T~RA~ or

T~CCO\ delay~ = 90ms + T~BCCH~+ T~RA~

190ms: is delay switch from UTRAN to GSM when UE has not synchronised to
the GSM cell before the CELL CHANGE ORDER FROM UTRAN is received; when
UE has synchronised to the GSM cell before the CELL CHANGE ORDER FROM
UTRAN is received, delay switch from UTRAN to GSM is 90ms.

T~BCCH~ is the maximum time allowed to read BCCH data from GSM cell.
According to TS 45.002, the maximum time allowed to read the BCCH data,
when being synchronized to a BCCH carrier, is 7.6s (in order to read
System Information type 13).

T~RA~ The additional delay caused by the random access procedure in the
GSM cell, is 10 ms (2 GSM radio frames).

#### A.6A.1.1.1 RRC re-establishment delay to a known target cell

##### A.6A.1.1.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose is to verify that the RRC re-establishment delay to a known
target cell is within the specified limits. This test will partly verify
the requirements in section 6A.1.2.

The test parameters are given in table A.6A.1 and table A.6A.2 below. In
the measurement control information it is indicated to the UE that
periodic reporting shall be used. The test consists of 2 successive time
periods, with time durations of T1 and T2 respectively.

During T1, the DL DPCH in cell 1 shall be transmitted in timeslot 2 and
the UL DPCH in cell 1 shall be transmitted in timeslot 10. At the
beginning of time period T2, the DPCH shall be removed.

Cell 1 and cell shall be synchronised, i.e. share the same frame and
timeslot timing.

##### A.6A.1.1.1.2 Test Requirements

The RRC re-establishment delay T~RE-ESTABLISH~ to a known target cell
shall be less than 2 s.

The rate of successful RRC re-establishments observed during repeated
tests shall be at least 90%.

NOTE: The RRC re-establishment delay in this test case can be expressed
as,

T~RE-ESTABLISH~= T~RRC-RE-ESTABLISH~+ T~UE-RE-ESTABLISH-REQ-KNOWN~.

where,

T~RRC-RE-ESTABLISH~= 160ms+(N~313~-1)\*10ms+T~313~

T~UE-RE-ESTABLISH-REQ-KNOWN~=50ms+T~SEARCH-KNOWN~ + T~SI~ + T~RA~,

and,

N~313~ Equal to 20 and therefore resulting in 200 ms delay.

T~313~ Equal to 0 s.

T~SEARCH-KNOWN~ Equal to 100 ms

T~SI~ Equal to 1280 ms, the time required for receiving all the relevant
system information data according to the reception procedure and the RRC
procedure performance value of system information blocks defined in
\[16\] for a UTRAN cell.

T~RA~ Equal to 40 ms, the additional delay caused by the random access
procedure.

#### A.6A.1.1.2 RRC re-establishment delay to an unknown target cell

##### A.6A.1.1.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose is to verify that the RRC re-establishment delay to an
unknown target cell is within the specified limits. This test will
partly verify the requirements in section 6A.1.2.

The test parameters are given in table A.6A.3 and table A.6A.4 below. In
the measurement control information it is indicated to the UE that
periodic reporting shall be used. The test consists of 2 successive time
periods, with time durations of T1 and T2 respectively.

During T1, the DL DPCH in cell 1 shall be transmitted in timeslot 2 and
the UL DPCH in cell 1 shall be transmitted in timeslot 10. At the
beginning of time period T2, the DPCH shall be removed.

Cell 1 and cell shall be synchronised, i.e. share the same frame and
timeslot timing.

##### A.6A.1.1.2.2 Test Requirements

The RRC re-establishment delay T~RE-ESTABLISH~ to an unknown target cell
shall be less than 3,7 s.

The rate of successful RRC re-establishments observed during repeated
tests shall be at least 90%.

NOTE: The RRC re-establishment delay in this test case can be expressed
as,

T~RE-ESTABLISH~= T~RRC-RE-ESTABLISH~+ T~UE-RE-ESTABLISH-REQ-UNKNOWN~.

where,

T~RRC-RE-ESTABLISH~= 160ms+(N~313~-1)\*10ms+T~313~

T~UE-RE-ESTABLISH-REQ-KNOWN~=50ms+T~SEARCH-UNKNOWN~ \*NF + T~SI~ +
T~RA~,

and,

N~313~ Equal to 20 and therefore resulting in 200 ms delay.

T~313~ Equal to 0 s.

T~SEARCH-UNKNOWN~ Equal to 800 ms

NF Equal to 2, the number of different frequencies in the monitored set
of cell 1.

T~SI~ Equal to 1280 ms, the time required for receiving all the relevant
system information data according to the reception procedure and the RRC
procedure performance value of system information blocks defined in
\[16\] for a UTRAN cell.

T~RA~ Equal to 40 ms, the additional delay caused by the random access
procedure.

##### A.6A.1.2.2 Test Requirements

###### A.6A.1.2.2.1 Test 1

The Re-establishment delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 2, and starts to
send SYNC-UL in the UpPTS for sending a CELL UPDATE message using the
cause \"radio link failure\".

The Re-establishment delay T~RE-ESTABLISH~ to a known cell shall be less
than 1815 ms.

The rate of correct tests observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

NOTE: The Re-establishment delay can be expressed in this case as

T~RE-ESTABLISH~= T~RRC-RE-ESTABLISH~+ T~UE-RE-ESTABLISH-REQ-KNOWN.~

Where

T~RRC-RE-ESTABLISH~ =160ms+(N~313~-1)\*10ms+T~313~

T~UE~-~RE-ESTABLISH-REQ-KNOWN~ =50ms+T~search~ + T~SI~ + T~RA,~

N313=20

T~313~=0s

T~search~ is the time it takes for the UE to search the cell.
*T~search~* =100 ms in case of a known target cell.

T~RA~ The additional delay caused by the random access procedure. 35 ms
is assumed in this test case

T~SI~ T~SI~ is the time required for receiving all the relevant system
information data according to the reception procedure and the RRC
procedure delay of system information blocks defined in 25.331 for a
UTRAN cell (ms) 1280 ms is assumed in this test case.

This gives a total delay of 1.815s allow 1.9s in the test case.

###### A.6A.1.2.2.2 Test 2

The Re-establishment delay is defined as the time from the beginning of
time period T2, to the moment when the UE camps on Cell 2, and starts to
send SYNC-UL in the UpPTS for sending a CELL UPDATE message using the
cause \"radio link failure\".

The Re-establishment delay to an unknown cell shall be less than 4115
ms.

The rate of correct tests observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

NOTE: The Re-establishment delay can be expressed in case as

T~RE-ESTABLISH~= T~RRC-RE-ESTABLISH~+ T~UE-RE-ESTABLISH-REQ-UNKNOWN~.

Where

T~RRC-RE-ESTABLISH~ =160ms+(N~313~-1)\*10ms+T~313~

T~UERE-ESTABLISH-REQ-UNKNOWN~=50ms+T~search~\*NF + T~SI~ + T~RA~,

N~313~=20

T~313~ =0s

T~search~ is the time it takes for the UE to search the cell.
*T~search~* =800 ms in case of an unknown target cell.

*NF* is the number of different frequencies in the monitored set. NF=3

T~RA~ The additional delay caused by the random access procedure. 35 ms
is assumed in this test case

T~SI~ is the time required for receiving all the relevant system
information data according to the reception procedure and the RRC
procedure delay of system information blocks defined in 25.331 for a
UTRAN cell (ms).1280 ms is assumed in this test case.

This gives a total of 4.115s, allow 4.2s in the test case.

### A.6A.1.3 7.68 Mcps TDD option

#### A.6A.1.3.1 RRC re-establishment delay to a known target cell

##### A.6A.1.3.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose is to verify that the RRC re-establishment delay to a known
target cell is within the specified limits. This test will partly verify
the requirements in section 6A.1.2.

The test parameters are given in table A.6A.5A and table A.6A.6A below.
In the measurement control information it is indicated to the UE that
periodic reporting shall be used. The test consists of 2 successive time
periods, with time durations of T1 and T2 respectively.

During T1, the DL DPCH in cell 1 shall be transmitted in timeslot 2 and
the UL DPCH in cell 1 shall be transmitted in timeslot 10. At the
beginning of time period T2, the DPCH shall be removed.

Cell 1 and cell shall be synchronised, i.e. share the same frame and
timeslot timing.

#### A.6A.1.3.1.2 Test Requirements

The RRC re-establishment delay T~RE-ESTABLISH~ to a known target cell
shall be less than 2 s.

The rate of successful RRC re-establishments observed during repeated
tests shall be at least 90%.

NOTE: The RRC re-establishment delay in this test case can be expressed
as,

T~RE-ESTABLISH~= T~RRC-RE-ESTABLISH~+ T~UE-RE-ESTABLISH-REQ-KNOWN~.

where,

T~RRC-RE-ESTABLISH~= 160ms+(N~313~-1)\*10ms+T~313~

T~UE-RE-ESTABLISH-REQ-KNOWN~=50ms+T~SEARCH-KNOWN~ + T~SI~ + T~RA~,

and,

N~313~ Equal to 20 and therefore resulting in 200 ms delay.

T~313~ Equal to 0 s.

T~SEARCH-KNOWN~ Equal to 100 ms

T~SI~ Equal to 1280 ms, the time required for receiving all the relevant
system information data according to the reception procedure and the RRC
procedure performance value of system information blocks defined in
\[16\] for a UTRAN cell.

T~RA~ Equal to 40 ms, the additional delay caused by the random access
procedure.

#### A.6A.1.3.2 RRC re-establishment delay to an unknown target cell

##### A.6A.1.3.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose is to verify that the RRC re-establishment delay to an
unknown target cell is within the specified limits. This test will
partly verify the requirements in section 6A.1.2.

The test parameters are given in table A.6A.7A and table A.6A.8A below.
In the measurement control information it is indicated to the UE that
periodic reporting shall be used. The test consists of 2 successive time
periods, with time durations of T1 and T2 respectively.

During T1, the DL DPCH in cell 1 shall be transmitted in timeslot 2 and
the UL DPCH in cell 1 shall be transmitted in timeslot 10. At the
beginning of time period T2, the DPCH shall be removed.

Cell 1 and cell shall be synchronised, i.e. share the same frame and
timeslot timing.

##### A.6A.1.3.2.2 Test Requirements

The RRC re-establishment delay T~RE-ESTABLISH~ to an unknown target cell
shall be less than 3,7 s.

The rate of successful RRC re-establishments observed during repeated
tests shall be at least 90%.

NOTE: The RRC re-establishment delay in this test case can be expressed
as,

T~RE-ESTABLISH~= T~RRC-RE-ESTABLISH~+ T~UE-RE-ESTABLISH-REQ-UNKNOWN~.

where,

T~RRC-RE-ESTABLISH~= 160ms+(N~313~-1)\*10ms+T~313~

T~UE-RE-ESTABLISH-REQ-KNOWN~=50ms+T~SEARCH-UNKNOWN~ \*NF + T~SI~ +
T~RA~,

and,

N~313~ Equal to 20 and therefore resulting in 200 ms delay.

T~313~ Equal to 0 s.

T~SEARCH-UNKNOWN~ Equal to 800 ms

NF Equal to 2, the number of different frequencies in the monitored set
of cell 1.

T~SI~ Equal to 1280 ms, the time required for receiving all the relevant
system information data according to the reception procedure and the RRC
procedure performance value of system information blocks defined in
\[16\] for a UTRAN cell.

T~RA~ Equal to 40 ms, the additional delay caused by the random access
procedure.

The test shall be performed in AWGN channel propagation conditions. The
P-CCPCH in the DL shall be transmitted in timeslot 0.

The amount of available user data shall be sufficient to allow uplink
transmission at the highest bit rate (UL\_TFC8 or UL\_TFC9) during the
entire test and it shall be ensured that the UE is using UL\_TFC8 or
UL\_TFC9 at the end of T1.

The test shall be performed in the following way:

**Before time period T1:**

The allowed TFCS according to table A.6A.5 shall be signalled to the UE.

**During time period T1:**

With the received P-CCPCH power level set to -60 dBm, the value of the
DPCH constant value shall be adjusted such that the mean UE output power
is -10 dBm. These conditions are held steady during period T1.

**During time period T2:**

At the beginning of time period T2, the received P-CCPCH power level
shall be decreased by 20 dB.

#### A.6A.2.1.2 Test Requirements

##### A.6A.2.1.2.1 Interactive or Background, PS, UL: 64 kbps

The UE shall have stopped using UL\_TFC8 and UL\_TFC9 within 170 ms from
beginning of time period T2.

The rate of correct TFC selections observed during repeated tests shall
be at least 90%.

NOTE: The delay from the begining of T2 can be expressed as:

T~detect\_block~ + T~notify~ + T~modify~+ T~L1\_proc~ + T~align\_TTI~ +
T~offset~

where:

T~detect\_block~ Equal to 30 ms, the time needed to detect that UL\_TFC8
and UL\_TFC9 can no longer be supported. This defines the maximum time
to detect that the *Elimination* criterion is fulfilled for UL\_TFC8 and
UL\_TFC9.

T~notify~ Equal to 15 ms, the time allowed for MAC to indicate to higher
layers that UL\_TFC8 and UL\_TFC9 can no longer be supported.

T~modify~ Equal to MAX(T~adapt\_max~,T~TTI~) = MAX(0, 40)=40ms

T~adapt\_max~ Equals to 0 ms for the case without codec.

T~TTI~ See section 6A.2. Equals 40 ms in the test case.

T~L1\_proc~ Equals 35 ms.

T~align\_TTI~ Align with the longest uplink TTI where the new TFC can be
selected. The worst case equals 40ms in this test case.

T~offset~ Equal to 10 ms, the maximum time between reception of the DL
beacon timeslot and the UL DPCH timeslot.

### A.6A.2.2 1.28 Mcps TDD option

#### A.6A.2.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose is to verify the UE blocks (stops using) a currently used

  ----------------------------- ------ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------

The test shall be performed in AWGN channel propagation conditions.

The radio conditions in the test shall be sufficient, so that decoding
of the TPC commands can be made without errors.

The amount of available user data shall be sufficient to allow uplink
transmission at the highest bit rate (UL\_TFC8 or UL\_TFC9) during the
entire test and it shall be ensured that the UE is using UL\_TFC8 or
UL\_TFC9 at the end of T1.

The test shall be performed in the following way:

**Before time period T1:**

The allowed TFCS according to table A.x.z shall be signalled to the UE.

**During time period T1:**

The system simulator shall ensure that the UE output power is commanded
to be between 9to 10 dB below the UE Maximum allowed UL TX power.

**During time period T2:**

The system simulator shall continously send TPC\_cmd=Up to the UE from
the beginning of T2 until the end of T2.

NOTE: This will emulate that UL\_TFC8 to UL\_TFC9 can not be supported
beacuse the UE reaches the maximum UL Tx power and still UTRAN is
sending power-up commands. The time from the beginning of T2 until the
UE blocks (stops using) UL\_TFC8 and UL\_TFC9 shall be measured.

#### A.6A.2.2.2 Test Requirements

##### A.6A.2.2.2.1 Interactive or Background, PS, UL: 64 kbps

The UE shall have stopped using UL\_TFC8 and UL\_TFC9 within \[TBD\] ms
from beginning of time period T2.

The rate of correct tests observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

NOTE: The delay from the begining of T2 can be expressed as: T~ramp~ +
T~detect\_block~ + T~notify~ + T~modify~+ T~L1\_proc~ + T~align\_TTI~,
where:

T~ramp~ Margin added for the increase of UE output power to the UE
maximum power. A margin of 7 frames (70ms) is used, i.e. 14 TPC
commands.

T~detect\_block~ The time needed to detect that UL\_TFC8 and UL\_TFC9
can no longer be supported, i.e. defines the maximum time to detect that
the *Limited TFC Set* criterion is fulfilled for UL\_TFC8 and UL\_TFC9.
This figure is currently TBD as X and Y in the general requirement, see
section 6.4.2, are not finalised yet.

T~notify~ Equal to \[15\] ms, the time allowed for MAC to indicate to
higher layers that UL\_TFC8 and UL\_TFC9 can no longer be supported.

T~modify~ Equal to MAX(T~adapt\_max~,T~TTI~) = MAX(0, 40)=40ms

T~adapt\_max~ Equals to 0ms for the case without codec.

T~L1\_proc~ Equals 15ms.

T~align\_TTI~ Align with the longest uplink TTI where the new TFC can be
selected. The worst case equals 40ms in this test case.

T~TTI~ See section 6.4.2. Equals 40 ms in the test case.

This gives a maximum delay of (70 + T~detect\_block~ + \[15\] + 40 + 15
+ 40) ms from the beginning of T2.

### A.6A.2.3 7.68 Mcps TDD option

#### A.6A.2.3.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose is to verify the UE blocks (stops using) a currently used
TFC when the UE output power is not sufficient to support that TFC. This
test will verify the general requirement on TFC selection in section
6A.2.

##### A.6A.2.3.1.1 Interactive or Background, PS, UL: 64 kbps

The test will verify the general requirement on TFC selection in section
6A.2 for a 64 kbps UL reference RAB intended for packet data services,
i.e. Interactive or Background, PS as defined in TS 34.108 and
multiplexed to a 3.4 kbps DCCH.

The test parameters are given in Table A.6A.16, A.6A.17, A.6A.18 and
Table A.6A.19 below. The test consists of 2 successive time periods,
with a time duration of T1 and T2 respectively.

Details on the UL reference RAB in table A.6A.17 is similar to that in
TS 34.108 section \"Interactive or background / UL:64 DL: 64 kbps / PS
RAB + UL:3.4 DL:3.4 kbps SRBs for DCCH\" with the exception that the
Spreading Factor is 32 here instead of 16.

The test shall be performed in AWGN channel propagation conditions. The
P-CCPCH in the DL shall be transmitted in timeslot 0.

The amount of available user data shall be sufficient to allow uplink
transmission at the highest bit rate (UL\_TFC8 or UL\_TFC9) during the
entire test and it shall be ensured that the UE is using UL\_TFC8 or
UL\_TFC9 at the end of T1.

The test shall be performed in the following way:

**Before time period T1:**

The allowed TFCS according to table A.6A.16 shall be signalled to the
UE.

**During time period T1:**

With the received P-CCPCH power level set to -60 dBm, the value of the
DPCH constant value shall be adjusted such that the mean UE output power
is -10 dBm. These conditions are held steady during period T1.

**During time period T2:**

At the beginning of time period T2, the received P-CCPCH power level
shall be decreased by 20 dB.

#### A.6A.2.3.2 Test Requirements

##### A.6A.2.3.2.1 Interactive or Background, PS, UL: 64 kbps

The UE shall have stopped using UL\_TFC8 and UL\_TFC9 within 170 ms from
beginning of time period T2.

The rate of correct TFC selections observed during repeated tests shall
be at least 90%.

NOTE: The delay from the beginning of T2 can be expressed as:

T~detect\_block~ + T~notify~ + T~modify~+ T~L1\_proc~ + T~align\_TTI~ +
T~offset~

where:

T~detect\_block~ Equal to 30 ms, the time needed to detect that UL\_TFC8
and UL\_TFC9 can no longer be supported. This defines the maximum time
to detect that the *Elimination* criterion is fulfilled for UL\_TFC8 and
UL\_TFC9.

T~notify~ Equal to 15 ms, the time allowed for MAC to indicate to higher
layers that UL\_TFC8 and UL\_TFC9 can no longer be supported.

T~modify~ Equal to MAX(T~adapt\_max~,T~TTI~) = MAX(0, 40)=40ms

T~adapt\_max~ Equals to 0 ms for the case without codec.

T~TTI~ See section 6A.2. Equals 40 ms in the test case.

T~L1\_proc~ Equals 35 ms.

T~align\_TTI~ Align with the longest uplink TTI where the new TFC can be
selected. The worst case equals 40ms in this test case.

T~offset~ Equal to 10 ms, the maximum time between reception of the DL
beacon timeslot and the UL DPCH timeslot.

#### A.6A.3.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment

##### A.6A.3.2.1.1 5ms TTI E-DCH E-TFC restriction testcase

The purpose is to verify the UE stops using a currently used E-TFC when
its power is not sufficient to support that E-TFC, and resumes using
that E-TFC when its power is sufficient to support it.

This test is to verify the requirement for the cell re-selection delay
in the single carrier case.

The test parameters are given in Table A.6A.20 and A.6A.21below. The
test consists of 3time periods, with a time duration of T1 ,T2 and T3
respectively.

An E-DCH radio bearer shall be configured, so that UE is transmitting
E-PUCH in the initial condition before the time T1, defined as T0.

The test shall be performed in the following way:

**Initial conditions:**

Call is established with HSDPA and E-DCH radio bearers. An absolute
grant with the value 31 is sent on the E-AGCH to give the UE sufficient
grants to make use of the maximum possible data rate.

**During time period T1:**

From the start of T1 the system simulator shall send sufficient
consecutive TPC\_cmd=Up to the UE until the value of TFCI changes.

**During time period T2:**

The system simulator shall continuously send TPC\_cmd=UP to the UE from
the beginning of T2 until the end of T2. Within 150ms from the start of
T2, the UE uplink E-UCCH shall indicate use of E-TFCI with index 0.

**During time period T3:**

The system simulator shall continuously send TPC\_cmd=Down for 15 times
to the UE from the beginning of T3 until the end of T3. The UE uplink
E-UCCH shall indicate use of E-TFCI with index 58.

Time periods T1, T2 and T3 shall be repeated until the necessary
statistical confidence is achieved.

#### A.6A.3.2.2 Test Requirements

##### A.6A.3.2.2.1 5ms TTI E-DCH E-TFC selection testcase

During time period T1, uplink power control shall be adjusted so that
the UE is able to make use of the maximum of its capabilities.

1\) The amount of available user data shall be sufficient to allow E-DCH
uplink transmission at the highest possible bit rate with E-DCH TB index
58.

2\) UE shall decrease E-TFCI to 0 within T~s~.

T~s~ = Power level change time + UE processing time =15\*5+15\*5=150ms

For the test to pass, the total number of successful tests shall be more
than 90% with a confidence level of 95% of the cases.

#### A.7.1.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify the requirements on timing advance
adjustment accuracy and timing advance adjustment delay in section
7.1.1.

The test parameters are given in table A.7.1 and table A.7.1A. The test
consists of two successive time periods, with a time duration of T1and
T2 respectively. At the start of time duration T1, the UE shall transmit
with the Uplink Timing Advance value set to zero, i.e. Timing Advance
disabled.

During time period T1, UTRAN shall send an Uplink Physical Channel
control message with activation time at the beginning of T2. The Uplink
Physical Channel Control message shall be sent to the UE such that the
delay between the end of the last received TTI containing the message
and the beginning of T2 is greater than or equal to the RRC procedure
delay as defined in \[16\].

#### A.7.4.2.2 Uplink synchronization control during handover

##### A.7.4.2.2.1 Scenario 1: Handover to intra-frequency cell

This test case is applicable for UE handovers in single frequency
network and UE handovers from primary frequency to primary frequency in
multi-frequency network.

###### A.7.4.2.2.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify the requirement for the uplink
synchronization control during intra-frequency handover in CELL\_DCH
state as reported in section 7.5.2.2.

The test parameters are given in Tables A.7.4.4 and A.7.4.5 below. The
test consists of three successive time periods, with a time duration of
T1, T2 and T3 respectively. At the start of time duration T1, the UE may
not have any timing information of cell 2.

UTRAN shall send a Physical Channel reconfiguration with activation time
\"now\" at the beginning of T3 with a new active cell, cell 2, after the
UE has reported event 1G. The starting point of T3 is defined as the end
of the last TTI containing the physical channel reconfiguration message.

UTRAN measures the initial uplink synchronization timing position of the
first uplink DPCH on the target cell and compares it with the desired
position. If the difference dose not exceed the accuracy requirements in
section 7.5.2.2, it is recorded as success once.

state as reported in section 7.5.2.2.

The test parameters are given in Tables A.7.4.7 and A.7.4.8 as below.
The test consists of three successive time periods, with a time duration
of T1, T2 and T3 respectively. At the start of time duration T1, the UE
may not have any timing information of cell 2.

UTRAN shall send a Physical Channel reconfiguration with activation time

UE has reported event 1G. The starting point of T3 is defined as the end
of the last TTI containing the physical channel reconfiguration message.

UTRAN measures the initial uplink synchronization timing position of the
first uplink DPCH on the target cell and compare it with the desired
position. If the difference dose not exceed the accuracy requirements in
section 7.5.2.2, it is recorded as success once.

### A.8.1.1 Event 1G triggered reporting in AWGN propagation conditions

#### A.8.1.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment

##### A.8.1.1.1.1 3.84 Mcps TDD option

The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE makes correct
reporting of events. This test will partly verify the requirements in
section 8.1.2 and section 9.1.

The test parameters are given in Table A.8.1.1 and A.8.1.1A below. The
test consists of three successive time periods, with time durations of
T1, T2 and T3 respectively. Three cells shall be present in the test,
cell 1 being the serving cell and cell 2 and cell 3 being neighbour
cells on the used frequency. All cells shall be synchronised, i.e. share
the same frame and timeslot timing.

In the measurement control information it is indicated to the UE that
event-triggered reporting with Event 1G shall be used, and that P-CCPCH
RSCP shall be reported together with Event 1G. The Measurement control
message shall be sent to the UE such that the delay between the end of
the last received TTI containing the message and the beginning of T1 is
at least equal to the RRC procedure delay as defined in \[16\].

The second Beacon timeslot shall be provided in timeslot 8 for both cell
1 and cell 2. The DL DPCH shall be transmitted in timeslot 2 and the UL
DPCH shall be transmitted in timeslot 10. The TTI of the uplink DCCH
shall be 20ms.

##### A.8.1.1.1.2 1.28 Mcps TDD option

The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE makes correct
reporting of events. This test will partly verify the requirements in
section 8.1A.2 and section 9.1.

The test parameters are given in Table A.8.1.1B and A.8.1.1C below. The
test consists of three successive time periods, with time durations of
T1, T2 and T3 respectively. Three cells shall be present in the test,
cell 1 being the serving cell and cell 2 and cell 3 being neighbour
cells on the used frequency. All cells shall be synchronised, i.e. share
the same frame and timeslot timing.

In the measurement control information it is indicated to the UE that
event-triggered reporting with Event 1G shall be used, and that P-CCPCH
RSCP shall be reported together with Event 1G reporting. The Measurement
control message shall be sent to the UE such that the delay between the
end of the last received TTI containing the message and the beginning of
T1 is at least equal to the RRC procedure delay as defined in \[16\].
The cell specific test parameters are given in Table A.8.1.1C below.

The TTI of the uplink DCCH shall be 40ms.

time period T2.

The UE shall send one Event 1G triggered measurement report for Cell 3
with a measurement reporting delay less than 880ms from the beginning of
time period T3.

The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as long as
the reporting criteria are not fulfilled.

The rate of events correctly reported during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

##### A.8.1.1.2.3 7.68Mcps TDD option

The UE shall send one Event 1G triggered measurement report for Cell 2
with a measurement reporting delay less than 200ms from the beginning of
time period T2.

The UE shall send one Event 1G triggered measurement report for Cell 3
with a measurement reporting delay less than 800ms from the beginning of
time period T3.

The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as long as
the reporting criteria are not fulfilled.

### A.8.1.2 Event 1H and 1I triggered reporting in AWGN propagation conditions

#### A.8.1.2.1 3.84 Mcps TDD option

##### A.8.1.2.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE makes correct
reporting of event 1H and event 1I. This test will partly verify the
requirements in section 8.1.2 and section 9.1.

The test parameters are given in Table A.8.1.2, Table A.8.1.2A and Table
A.8.1.2B below. The test consists of five successive time periods, with
a time duration of T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5 respectively. Two cells shall
be present in the test, cell 1 being the current serving cell and cell 2
being a neighbour cell on the used frequency.

In the measurement control information it shall be indicated to the UE
that event-triggered reporting with event 1H and event 1I shall be used
and that Timeslot ISCP and P-CCPCH RSCP shall be reported together with
event 1H and 1I. Measurement control information shall be sent to the UE
before the beginning of time period T1.

The second Beacon timeslot shall be provided in timeslot 8 for both cell
1 and cell 2. The UL DPCH shall be transmitted in timeslot 10. In
addition, timeslots 3 and 4 shall be allocated as DL timeslots. Cell 1
and cell 2 shall be synchronised, i.e. share the same frame and timeslot
timing.

measurement reporting delay less than 400 ms from the beginning of time
period T2.

The UE shall send one event 1H triggered measurement report, with a
measurement reporting delay less than 400 ms from the beginning of time
period T3.

The UE shall send one event 1H triggered measurement report, with a
measurement reporting delay less than 400 ms from the beginning of time
period T4.

The UE shall send one event 1I triggered measurement report, with a
measurement reporting delay less than 400 ms from the beginning of time
period T5.

The UE shall not send event 1H or 1I triggered measurement reports, as
long as the reporting criteria are not fulfilled.

The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

#### A.8.1.2.2 1.28 Mcps TDD option

##### A.8.1.2.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE makes correct
reporting of event 1H and event 1I. This test will partly verify the
requirements in section 8.1A.2 and section 9.1.

The test parameters are given in Table A.8.1.2C, Table A.8.1.2D and
Table A.8.1.2E below. The test consists of four successive time periods,
with a time duration of T1, T2, T3 and T4 respectively. Two cells shall
be present in the test, cell 1 being the current serving cell and cell 2
being a neighbour cell on the used frequency.

In the measurement control information it shall be indicated to the UE
that event-triggered reporting with event 1H and event 1I shall be used
and that Timeslot ISCP and P-CCPCH RSCP shall be reported together with
event 1H and 1I. Measurement control information shall be sent to the UE
before the beginning of time period T1.

The UL DPCH shall be transmitted in timeslot 2. In addition, timeslots 5
and 6 shall be allocated as DL timeslots.

##### A.8.1.2.3.2 Test Requirements

The UE shall send one event 1I triggered measurement report, with a
measurement reporting delay less than 400 ms from the beginning of time
period T2.

The UE shall send one event 1H triggered measurement report, with a
measurement reporting delay less than 400 ms from the beginning of time
period T3.

The UE shall send one event 1H triggered measurement report, with a
measurement reporting delay less than 400 ms from the beginning of time
period T4.

The UE shall send one event 1I triggered measurement report, with a
measurement reporting delay less than 400 ms from the beginning of time
period T5.

The UE shall not send event 1H or 1I triggered measurement reports, as
long as the reporting criteria are not fulfilled.

The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

### A.8.1.3 Correct reporting of neighbours in fading propagation condition

#### A.8.1.3.1 3.84 Mcps TDD option

##### A.8.1.3.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE performs sufficient
layer 1 filtering of the P-CCPCH RSCP measurement which is the base for
Event 1G evaluation. This test is performed in fading propagation
conditions and will partly verify the requirements in section 8.1.2.

The test parameters are given in Table A.8.1.3 and A.8.1.3A below. The
test consists of one time period with time duration of T1. Two cells
shall be present in the test, cell 1 being the current serving cell and
cell 2 being a neighbour cell on the used frequency. Cell 1 and cell 2
shall be synchronised, i.e. share the same frame and timeslot timing.

In the measurement control information it is indicated to the UE that
event-triggered reporting with Event 1G shall be used, and that P-CCPCH
RSCP shall be reported together with Event 1G. The Measurement control
message shall be sent to the UE such that the delay between the end of
the last received TTI containing the message and the beginning of T1 is
at least equal to the RRC procedure delay as defined in \[16\].

The DL DPCH shall be transmitted in timeslot 4 and the UL DPCH shall be
transmitted in timeslot 12. The TTI of the UL DCCH shall be 20ms.

##### A.8.1.3.1.2 Test Requirements

The number of Event 1G triggered measurement reports during time period
T2 shall be less than 60.

#### A.8.1.3.2 (void)

#### A.8.1.3.3 7.68 Mcps TDD option

##### A.8.1.3.3.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE performs sufficient
layer 1 filtering of the P-CCPCH RSCP measurement which is the base for
Event 1G evaluation. This test is performed in fading propagation
conditions and will partly verify the requirements in section 8.1.2B.

The test parameters are given in Table A.8.1.3B and A.8.1.3C below. The
test consists of one time period with time duration of T1. Two cells
shall be present in the test, cell 1 being the current serving cell and
cell 2 being a neighbour cell on the used frequency. Cell 1 and cell 2
shall be synchronised, i.e. share the same frame and timeslot timing.

In the measurement control information it is indicated to the UE that
event-triggered reporting with Event 1G shall be used, and that P-CCPCH
RSCP shall be reported together with Event 1G. The Measurement control
message shall be sent to the UE such that the delay between the end of
the last received TTI containing the message and the beginning of T1 is
at least equal to the RRC procedure delay as defined in \[16\].

The DL DPCH shall be transmitted in timeslot 4 and the UL DPCH shall be
transmitted in timeslot 12. The TTI of the UL DCCH shall be 20ms.

--------------------------------------

### A.8.2.1 Correct reporting of neighbours in AWGN propagation condition

#### A.8.2.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment

##### A.8.2.1.1.1 3.84Mcps TDD option

The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE makes correct
reporting of an event when doing inter frequency measurements. The test
will partly verify the requirements in section 8.1.2. and 9.1

The test consists of 2 successive time periods, with a time duration T1
and T2. The test parameters are given in tables A.8.2A and A.8.2B below.
Two cells shall be present in the test, cell 1 being the serving cell
and cell 2 being a UTRA TDD neighbour cell on the unused frequency. All
cells shall be synchronised, i.e. share the same frame and timeslot
timing.

In the measurement control information it is indicated to the UE that
event-triggered reporting with Event 2C shall be used. P-CCPCH RSCP of
the best cell on the unused frequency shall be reported together with
Event 2C reporting. The Measurement control message shall be sent to the
UE such that the delay between the end of the last received TTI
containing the message and the beginning of T1 is at least equal to the
RRC procedure delay as defined in \[16\].

The second Beacon timeslot shall be provided in timeslot 8 for both cell
1 and cell 2. The DL DPCH shall be transmitted in timeslot 1 and the UL
DPCH shall be transmitted in timeslot 3. The TTI of the uplink DCCH
shall be 20 ms.

##### A.8.2.1.1.2 1.28Mcps TDD option 

The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE makes correct
reporting of an event when doing inter frequency measurements. The test
will partly verify the requirements in section 8.1A.2 and 9.1.

The test consist of 2 successive time periods, with a time duration T1
and T2. The test parameters are given in tables A.8.2C and A.8.2D below.
Two cells shall be present in the test, cell 1 being the active cell and
cell 2 being a 1.28Mcps TDD option neighbour cell on the unused
frequency.

In the measurement control information it is indicated to the UE that
event-triggered reporting with Event 2C shall be used. P-CCPCH RSCP of
the best cell on the unused frequency shall be reported together with
Event 2C reporting. The measurement control message shall be sent to the
UE such that the delay between the end of the last received TTI
containing the message and the beginning of T1 is at least equal to the
RRC procedure delay as defined in \[16\].

##### A.8.2.1.1.3 7.68Mcps TDD option

The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE makes correct
reporting of an event when doing inter frequency measurements. The test
will partly verify the requirements in section 8.1.2B and 9.1

The test consists of 2 successive time periods, with a time duration T1
and T2. The test parameters are given in tables A.8.2E and A.8.2F below.
Two cells shall be present in the test, cell 1 being the serving cell
and cell 2 being a UTRA TDD neighbour cell on the unused frequency. All
cells shall be synchronised, i.e. share the same frame and timeslot
timing.

In the measurement control information it is indicated to the UE that
event-triggered reporting with Event 2C shall be used. P-CCPCH RSCP of
the best cell on the unused frequency shall be reported together with
Event 2C reporting. The Measurement control message shall be sent to the
UE such that the delay between the end of the last received TTI
containing the message and the beginning of T1 is at least equal to the
RRC procedure delay as defined in \[16\].

The second Beacon timeslot shall be provided in timeslot 8 for both cell
1 and cell 2. The DL DPCH shall be transmitted in timeslot 1 and the UL
DPCH shall be transmitted in timeslot 3. The TTI of the uplink DCCH
shall be 20 ms.

### A.8.3.1 Correct reporting of FDD neighbours in AWGN propagation condition

#### A.8.3.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment

##### A.8.3.1.1.1 3.84 Mcps TDD option

The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE makes correct
reporting of events when measuring on UTRA FDD cells. This test will
partly verify the requirements in section 8.1.2 and 9.1.

The test parameters are given in Table A.8.3A and A.8.3B below. The test
consists of two successive time periods, with time durations of T1 and
T2 respectively. Two cells shall be present in the test, cell 1 being
the serving UTRA TDD cell and cell 2 being a UTRA FDD neighbour cells on
the unused frequency.

In the measurement control information it is indicated to the UE that
event-triggered reporting with Event 2C shall be used and that CPICH
Ec/I0 of the best cell on the unused frequency shall be reported
together with Event 2C. The Measurement control message shall be sent to
the UE such that the delay between the end of the last received TTI
containing the message and the beginning of T1 is at least equal to the
RRC procedure delay as defined in \[16\].

The second Beacon timeslot shall be provided in timeslot 8 for cell 1.
The DL DPCH shall be transmitted in timeslot 1 and the UL DPCH shall be
transmitted in timeslot 3. The TTI of the uplink DCCH shall be 20 ms.

##### A.8.3.1.1.3 7.68 Mcps TDD option

The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE makes correct
reporting of events when measuring on UTRA FDD cells. This test will
partly verify the requirements in section 8.1.2B and 9.1.

The test parameters are given in Table A.8.3E and A.8.3F below. The test
consists of two successive time periods, with time durations of T1 and
T2 respectively. Two cells shall be present in the test, cell 1 being
the serving UTRA TDD cell and cell 2 being a UTRA FDD neighbour cells on
the unused frequency.

In the measurement control information it is indicated to the UE that
event-triggered reporting with Event 2C shall be used and that CPICH
Ec/I0 of the best cell on the unused frequency shall be reported
together with Event 2C. The Measurement control message shall be sent to
the UE such that the delay between the end of the last received TTI
containing the message and the beginning of T1 is at least equal to the
RRC procedure delay as defined in \[16\].

The second Beacon timeslot shall be provided in timeslot 8 for cell 1.
The DL DPCH shall be transmitted in timeslot 1 and the UL DPCH shall be
transmitted in timeslot 3. The TTI of the uplink DCCH shall be 20 ms.

### A.8.4.1 Correct reporting of GSM neighbours in AWGN propagation condition

#### A.8.4.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment

##### A.8.4.1.1.1 3.84 Mcps TDD option

The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE makes correct
reporting of an event when doing GSM measurements. This test will partly
verify the requirements in section 8.1.2.5. The requirements are also
applicable for a UE not requiring idle intervals to perform GSM
measurements.

The test parameters are given in Tables A.8.4.1, A.8.4.2 and A.8.4.3
below. In the measurement control information it is indicated to the UE
that event-triggered reporting with Event 3B and 3C shall be used. The
test consists of three successive time periods, with a time duration of
T1, T2 and T3 respectively. At the start of time duration T1, the UE may
not have any timing information of cell 2.

Cell 1 is a UTRA TDD cell and cell 2 is a GSM cell. The Beacon timeslot
shall be transmitted in timeslot 0 for cell 1 and no second Beacon
timeslot shall be provided for cell 1. The DL DPCH shall be transmitted
in timeslot 1 and the UL DPCH shall be transmitted in timeslot 3.

##### A.8.4.1.1.3 7.68 Mcps TDD option

The purpose of this test is to verify that the UE makes correct
reporting of an event when doing GSM measurements. This test will partly
verify the requirements in section 8.1.2B.5. The requirements are also
applicable for a UE not requiring idle intervals to perform GSM
measurements.

The test parameters are given in Tables A.8.4.7, A.8.4.8 and A.8.4.9
below. In the measurement control information it is indicated to the UE
that event-triggered reporting with Event 3B and 3C shall be used. The
test consists of three successive time periods, with a time duration of
T1, T2 and T3 respectively. At the start of time duration T1, the UE may
not have any timing information of cell 2.

Cell 1 is a UTRA TDD cell and cell 2 is a GSM cell. The Beacon timeslot
shall be transmitted in timeslot 0 for cell 1 and no second Beacon
timeslot shall be provided for cell 1. The DL DPCH shall be transmitted
in timeslot 1 and the UL DPCH shall be transmitted in timeslot 3.

### A 8.4.2 Combined UTRA TDD inter-frequency and GSM cell search under AWGN propagation condition

#### A8.4.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment

##### A8.4.2.1.1 3.84 Mcps TDD option

##### A8.4.2.1.2 1.28 Mcps TDD option

This test is to verify that the UE makes correct reporting of an event
when doing inter frequency measurements and GSM measurements. The test
will partly verify the requirements in section 8.1A.2.3 combined
8.1A.2.5 under AWGN propagation conditions.

This test scenario comprised of 2 UTRA TDD cells working on different
frequency, and 1 GSM cell. Test parameters are given in Table
A.8.4.2.1.2-1, A.8.4.2.1.2-2, and A.8.4.2.1.2-3. Two UTRA TDD cells
shall be synchronized, i.e. sharing the same frame and timeslot timing.

The test consists of 3 successive time periods, with time duration T1,
T2 and T3. In the measurement control information it is indicated to the
UE that event-triggered reporting with Event 2C and 3C shall be used.

##### A.8.5.2.2.2 1.28 Mcps TDD option

The UE shall send one Event 3c triggered measurement report, with a
measurement reporting delay less than 7.7s from the beginning of time
period T2.

The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as long as
the reporting criteria are not fulfilled.

The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

NOTE: The actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to
2xTTI~DCCH~ higher than the measurement reporting delays above because
of TTI insertion uncertainty of the measurement report in DCCH.

#### A.8.5.3.1 Test Purpose and Environment

##### A.8.5.3.1.1 3.84 Mcps TDD option

##### A.8.5.3.1.2 1.28 Mcps TDD option

This test is to verify that the UE makes correct reporting of an event
when doing inter frequency measurements and E-UTRA FDD measurements. The
test will partly verify the requirements in section 8.1A.2.3 combined
8.1A.2.6 under fading propagation conditions.

This test scenario comprised of 2 UTRA TDD cells working on different
frequency, and 1 E-UTRA FDD cell. Test parameters are given in Table
A.8.5.3.1.2-1, A.8.5.3.1.2-2, and A.8.5.3.1.2-3. Scheduled idle interval
of 80ms period as defined in TS25.331 is provided. Two UTRA TDD cells
shall be synchronised, i.e. sharing the same frame and timeslot timing.

The test consists of 2 successive time periods, with time duration T1
and T2. In the measurement control information it is indicated to the UE
that event-triggered reporting with Event 2B and 3A shall be used.

##### A.8.5.3.2.1 3.84 Mcps TDD option

##### A.8.5.3.2.2 1.28 Mcps TDD option

The UE shall send one Event 2B triggered measurement report for Cell2,
with a measurement reporting delay less than 5s from the beginning of
time period T2.

The UE shall send one Event 3A triggered measurement report for Cell3,
with a measurement reporting delay less than 4270ms from the beginning
of time period T2.

The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as long as
the reporting criteria are not fulfilled.

The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

NOTE: The actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to
2xTTI~DCCH~ higher than the measurement reporting delays above because
of TTI insertion uncertainty of the measurement report in DCCH.

#### A.8.5.4.1 Test Purpose and Environment

##### A.8.5.4.1.1 3.84 Mcps TDD option

##### A.8.5.4.1.2 1.28 Mcps TDD option

This test is to verify that the UE makes correct reporting of an event
when doing inter frequency measurements and E-UTRA TDD measurements. The
test will partly verify the requirements in section 8.1A.2.3 combined
8.1A.2.7 under fading propagation conditions.

This test scenario comprised of 2 UTRA TDD cells working on different
frequency, and 1 E-UTRA TDD cell. Test parameters are given in Table
A.8.5.4.1.2-1, A.8.5.4.1.2-2, and A.8.5.4.1.2-3. Scheduled idle interval
of 80ms period as defined in TS25.331 is provided. Two UTRA TDD cells
shall be synchronised, i.e. sharing the same frame and timeslot timing.

The test consists of 2 successive time periods, with time duration T1
and T2. In the measurement control information it is indicated to the UE
that event-triggered reporting with Event 2B and 3a shall be used.

##### A.8.5.4.1.3 7.68 Mcps TDD option

#### A.8.5.4.2 Test Requirements

##### A.8.5.4.2.1 3.84 Mcps TDD option

##### A.8.5.4.2.2 1.28 Mcps TDD option

The UE shall send one Event 2B triggered measurement report for Cell2,
with a measurement reporting delay less than 5s from the beginning of
time period T2.

The UE shall send one Event 3a triggered measurement report for Cell3,
with a measurement reporting delay less than 4270ms from the beginning
of time period T2.

The UE shall not send event triggered measurement reports, as long as
the reporting criteria are not fulfilled.

The rate of correct events observed during repeated tests shall be at
least 90%.

NOTE: The actual overall delays measured in the test may be up to
2xTTI~DCCH~ higher than the measurement reporting delays above because
of TTI insertion uncertainty of the measurement report in DCCH.

##### A.8.5.4.2.3 7.68 Mcps TDD option

A.9 Measurement Performance Requirements
========================================

Unless explicitly stated:

\- Measurement channel is 12.2 kbps as defined in TS 25.102 annex A.
This measurement channel is used both in active cell and cells to be
measured.

\- Cell 1 is the active cell.

\- Single task reporting.

\- Power control is active.

A.9.1 Measurement Performance for UE (3.84 Mcps TDD option)
-----------------------------------------------------------

### A.9.1.1 P-CCPCH RSCP

#### A.9.1.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the P-CCPCH RSCP measurement
accuracy is within the specified limits. This test will verify the
requirements in section 9.1.1.1.

Cell 1 and cell 2 shall be synchronised, i.e. share the same frame and
timeslot timing. The DL DPCH shall be transmitted in timeslot 4 and the
UL DPCH shall be transmitted in timeslot 12.

##### A.9.1.1.1.1 Intra frequency test parameters

In this case all cells are on the same frequency. The second Beacon
timeslot shall be provided in timeslot 8 for both cell 1 and cell 2.

Both P-CCPCH RSCP intra frequency absolute and relative accuracy
requirements are tested by using test parameters in Table A.9.1.

##### A.9.1.8.2.2 Test Requirements

The SFN-SFN observed time difference type 2 measurement accuracy shall
meet the requirements in section 9.1.1.8.

The rate of correct measurements observed during repeated tests shall be
at least 90%.

### A.9.1.9 Observed time difference to GSM cell

NOTE: This section is included for consistency with numbering in section
9, currently no test covering requirements in sections 9.1.1.9 exists.

### A.9.1.10 SFN-CFN observed time difference

#### A.9.1.10.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the SFN-CFN observed time
difference measurement accuracy is within the specified limits. This
test will verify the requirements in section 9.1.1.10.

Cell 1 and cell 2 shall be synchronised, i.e. share the same frame and
timeslot timing. During the test, the timing difference between cell 1
and cell 2 can be set to any value from 0...256 frames.

The DL DPCH shall be transmitted in timeslot 4 and the UL DPCH shall be
transmitted in timeslot 12. The second Beacon timeslot shall be provided
in timeslot 8 for cell 1 and in timeslot 10 for cell 2.

##### A.9.1.10.1.1 Intra frequency test parameters

In this case all cells are on the same frequency. The SFN-CFN observed
time difference accuracy requirements in the intra-frequency case are
tested by using test parameters in Table A.9.9.

##### A.9.2.8.1.2 Test Requirements

The SFN-SFN observed time difference type 1 measurement accuracy shall
meet the requirements in section 9.1.1.8.

The rate of correct measurements observed during repeated tests shall be
at least 90%.

#### A.9.2.8.2 SFN-SFN observed time difference type 2

##### A.9.2.8.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the SFN-SFN observed time
difference type 2 measurement accuracy is within the specified limits.
This test will verify the requirements in section 9.1.1.8.

Cell 1 and cell 2 shall be synchronised and share the same frame timing.
During the test, the timing difference between cell 1 and cell 2 can be
set to valid values in the rang from -432 to 432 chip.

The DL DPCH shall be transmitted in timeslot 4 and the UL DPCH shall be
transmitted in timeslot 2.

###### A.9.2.8.2.1.1 Intra frequency test parameters

The SFN-SFN observed time difference type 2 accuracy requirements in the
intra-frequency case are tested by using test parameters in Table
A.9.18A.

##### A.9.2.8.2.2 Test Requirements

The SFN-SFN observed time difference type 2 measurement accuracy shall
meet the requirements in section 9.1.1.8.

The rate of correct measurement observed during repeated tests shall be
at least 90%.

### A.9.2.9 Observed time difference to GSM cell

NOTE: This section is included for consistency with numbering in section
9, currently no test covering requirements in sections 9.1.1.9 exists.

### A.9.2.10 SFN-CFN observed time difference

#### A.9.2.10.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the SFN-CFN observed time
difference measurement accuracy is within the specified limits. This
test will verify the requirements in section 9.1.1.10.

Cell 1 and cell 2 shall be synchronised. During the test, the timing
difference between cell 1 and cell 2 can be set to any value from
0...256 frames.

The DL DPCH shall be transmitted in timeslot 4 and the UL DPCH shall be
transmitted in timeslot 2.

##### A.9.2.10.1.1 Intra frequency test parameters

The SFN-CFN observed time difference accuracy requirements in the
intra-frequency case are tested by using test parameters in Table
A.9.19.

##### A.9.2.11.1.1 Test procedure

1\) Set the UE power and Maximum allowed UL TX power to the maximum
power for that UE power class specified in section 9.1.2.1.

2\) Send continuously Up power control commands to the UE during the
entire test.

3\) Check the UE reported value

4\) Map the UE reported value to accuracy requirement and define the
test limits

5\) Measure the output power of the UE. The output power shall be
averaged over one timeslot.

6\) Check that the measured UE transmitted power is within the limits
defined in step 4).

7\) Decrease the Maximum allowed UL TX power with 1dB and signal the new
value to the UE.

##### A.9.3.8.1.2 Test Requirements

The SFN-SFN observed time difference type 1 measurement accuracy shall
meet the requirements in section 9.1.1.8.

The rate of correct measurements observed during repeated tests shall be
at least 90%.

#### A.9.3.8.2 SFN-SFN observed time difference type 2

##### A.9.3.8.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the SFN-SFN observed time
difference type 2 measurement accuracy is within the specified limits.
This test will verify the requirements in section 9.1.1.8.

Cell 1 and cell 2 shall be synchronised, i.e. share the same frame and
timeslot timing. During the test, the timing difference between cell 1
and cell 2 can be set to any value from -2560 \... +2560 chip.

The DL DPCH shall be transmitted in timeslot 4 and the UL DPCH shall be
transmitted in timeslot 12. The second Beacon timeslot shall be provided
in timeslot 8 for cell 1 and in timeslot 10 for cell 2.

###### A.9.3.8.2.1.1 Intra frequency test parameters

In this case all cells are on the same frequency. The SFN-SFN observed
time difference type 2 accuracy requirements in the intra-frequency case
are tested by using test parameters in Table A.9.33.

##### A.9.2.5a.1.3 Test Requirements

The E-UTRA RSRP measurement absolute accuracy shall meet the
requirements in section 9.1.1.5a.

The rate of correct measurements observed during repeated tests shall be
at least 90%.

#### A.9.2.5a.2 E-UTRAN TDD RSRP

##### A.9.2.5a.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the E-UTRA TDD RSRP
measurement absolute accuracy is within the specified limits. This test
will verify the requirements in section 9.1.1.5a and applies to UE
supporting this capability.

The DL DPCH shall be transmitted in timeslot 4 and the UL DPCH shall be
transmitted in timeslot 2. Idle interval of 80ms period as defined in
TS25.331 is provided. In the measurement control information it is
indicated to the UE that periodic reporting of the E-UTRA RSRP
measurement is used.

##### A.9.2.5a.2.2 Test parameters

In this set of test cases there are two cells. Cell 1 is a UTRA TDD cell
and cell 2 is a E-UTRA TDD cell. In all test cases, Cell 1 is the
serving cell and Cell 2 is the target cell. The RSRP absolute accuracy
requirements are tested by using test parameters in Table A.9.2.5a.2-1,
Table A.9.2.5a.2-2, and Table A.9.2.5a.2-3.

#### A.9.2.5b.1 E-UTRAN FDD RSRQ

##### A.9.2.5b.1.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the E-UTRA FDD RSRQ
measurement absolute accuracy is within the specified limits. This test
will verify the requirements in section 9.1.1.5b and applies to UE
supporting this capability.

Cell 1 is a UTRA TDD cell and cell 2 is a E-UTRA FDD cell. In all tests,
Cell 1 is the serving cell and Cell 2 the target cell. In the
measurement control information it is indicated to the UE that periodic
reporting of the E-UTRA RSRQ measurement is used.

Idle interval of 80ms period as defined in TS25.331 is provided.

##### A.9.2.5b.1.2 Test parameters

E-UTRA FDD RSRQ accuracy requirements are tested by using test
parameters in Table A.9.2.5b.1-1, A.9.2.5b.1-2, and A.9.2.5b.1-3.

##### A.9.2.5b.1.3 Test Requirements

The E-UTRA RSRQ measurement absolute accuracy shall meet the
requirements in section 9.1.1.5b.

The rate of correct measurements observed during repeated tests shall be
at least 90%.

#### A.9.2.5b.2 E-UTRAN TDD RSRQ

##### A.9.2.5b.2.1 Test Purpose and Environment

The purpose of this test is to verify that the E-UTRA TDD RSRQ absolute
measurement accuracy is within the specified limits. This test will
verify the requirements in section 9.1.1.5b and applies to UE supporting
this capability.

The DL DPCH shall be transmitted in timeslot 4 and the UL DPCH shall be
transmitted in timeslot 2. Idle interval of 80ms period as defined in
TS25.331 is provided. In the measurement control information it is
indicated to the UE that periodic reporting of the E-UTRA RSRQ
measurement is used.

##### A.9.2.5b.2.2 Test parameters

In this set of test cases there are two cells. Cell 1 is a UTRA TDD cell
and cell 2 is a E-UTRA TDD cell. The RSRQ absolute accuracy requirements
are tested by using test parameters in Table A.9.2.5b.2-1, Table
A.9.2.5b.2-2 and Table A.9.2.5b.2-3. In all test cases, Cell 1 is the
serving cell and Cell 2 is the target cell.
