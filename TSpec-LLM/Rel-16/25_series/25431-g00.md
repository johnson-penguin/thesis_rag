Foreword
========

This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

1 Scope
=======

The present document specifies the standards allowed to implement Layer
1 on the Iub interface.

The specification of transmission delay requirements and O&M
requirements is not in the scope of this document.

In the following 'Layer 1' and 'Physical Layer' are assumed to be
synonymous.

2 References
============

The following documents contain provisions which, through reference in
this text, constitute provisions of the present document.

● References are either specific (identified by date of publication,
edition number, version number, etc.) or non‑specific.

● For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.

● For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the case
of a reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), a
non-specific reference implicitly refers to the latest version of that
document *in the same Release as the present document*.

\[1\] 3GPP TS 25.411: \"UTRAN Iu interface Layer 1\".

\[2\] ATM Forum AF-PHY-0130.00 (1999-10): \"ATM on Fractional E1/T1\".

3 Definitions and abbreviations
===============================

For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions
given in 3GPP TS 25.411 \[1\] apply.

4 Iub Layer 1
=============

The Iub Layer 1 shall comply with the requirements of chapter 4 in TS
25.411 \[1\].

In addition, for the Iub Layer 1, it shall be possible to use n 64
kbit/s time slots within the scope of \"ATM on Fractional E1/T1\" as
specified in ATM Forum AF-PHY-0130.00 \[2\], and to allow the
co-existence of this interface with other interfaces on the same
physical medium.
