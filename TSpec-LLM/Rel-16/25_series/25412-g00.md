4 Data Link Layer
=================

4.1 ATM Transport Option
------------------------

ATM shall be used in the radio network control plane according to (ITU-T
Rec. I.361 \[5\]). The structure of the cell header used in the UTRAN Iu
interface is the cell header format and encoding at NNI (see Figure
3/I.361).

4.2 IP Transport Option
-----------------------

An RNC/CN using IP transport option shall support the PPP protocol with
HDLC framing (IETF RFC 1661 \[19\], IETF RFC 1662 \[20\]).

Note: This does not preclude the single implementation and use of any
other data link layer protocol (e.g. PPPMux (IETF RFC 3153
\[29\])/AAL5/ATM, PPP/AAL2/ATM, Ethernet, MPLS (IETF RFC 3031
\[28\])/ATM, etc.) fulfilling the UTRAN requirements toward the upper
Layers.

An RNC/CN using IP transport option having interfaces connected via low
bandwidth PPP links like E1/T1/J1 shall also support IP Header
Compression (IETF RFC 2507 \[21\]) and the PPP extensions ML/MC-PPP
(IETF RFC 1990 \[22\], IETF RFC 2686 \[23\]). In this case, the
negotiation of header compression (IETF RFC 2507 \[21\]) over PPP shall
be performed via IETF RFC 2509 \[24\].

5 RANAP Signalling Bearer
=========================

5.1 Introduction
----------------

This subclause specifies the Signalling Bearer protocol stack that
supports the RANAP signalling protocol.

The following requirements on the Signalling Bearer can be stated:

\- provide reliable transfer of control plane signalling messages in
both connectionless mode and connection-oriented mode;

\- provide separate independent connections for distinguishing
transactions with individual UE\'s;

\- supervise the \'UE connections\' and provide connection status
information to the Upper Layers for individual UE\'s;

\- provide networking and routing functions;

\- provide redundancy in the signalling network;

\- provide load sharing.

5.2 Signalling Bearer for Circuit Switched Domain
-------------------------------------------------

### 5.2.1 Protocol Stack for the CS Domain

The protocol stacks for the CS Domain are shown in figure 1. The
standard allows operators to choose one out of two standardised protocol
suites for transport of SCCP messages.

Figure 1 shows, for the Iu IP CS domain, the point at which the service
primitives are invoked. A single SAP is defined independently of the
signalling bearer. The SAP provides the SCCP primitives. The figure is
not intended to constrain the architecture.

The following figure 1 also illustrates the protocol model having
Broadband Signalling System No.7 as the signalling bearer for RANAP over
the Iu interface that fulfils the requirements. Figure 1 shows, for the
CS domain, the point at which the service primitives are invoked. The
SAP provides the SCCP primitives.

### 5.2.2 ATM Transport Option

1\. **SCCP** (ITU-T Rec. Q.711 \[7\] or ANSI T1.112-2001 \[32\])
provides connectionless service, class 0, connection oriented service,
class 2, separation of the connections mobile by mobile basis on the
connection oriented link and establishment of a connection oriented link
mobile by mobile basis. SCCP shall be used as specified in TS 25.410
\[18\].

2\. **MTP3-B** (ITU-T Rec. Q.2210 \[4\] or ANSI T1.111-2001 \[31\])
provides message routing, discrimination and distribution (for
point-to-point link only), signalling link management load sharing and
changeover/back between link within one link-set. The need for multiple
link-sets is precluded. MTB3-B shall comply with ITU-T Rec. Q.2210 \[4\]
or ANSI T1.111-2001 \[31\].

3\. **SAAL-NNI** (ITU-T Rec. Q.2100 \[1\]) consists of the following
sub-layers: - **SSCF** (ITU-T Rec. Q.2140 \[3\] or ANSI T1.645-1995
(R2003) \[33\]), - **SSCOP** (ITU-T Rec. Q.2110 \[2\]) and -- **AAL5**
(ITU-T Rec. I.363.5 \[6\]). The SSCF maps the requirements of the layer
above to the requirements of SSCOP. Also SAAL connection management,
link status and remote processor status mechanisms are provided. SSCOP
provides mechanisms for the establishment and release of connections and
the reliable exchange of signalling information between signalling
entities. Adapts the upper layer protocol to the requirements of the
Lower ATM cells. It shall be possible to use SAAL-NNI connections
pre-configured as PVCs for signalling transport on the Iu-Interface.

Adaptation Layer \" (IETF RFC 3332 \[17\]) also developed by the Sigtran
working group of the IETF. An RNC equipped with the M3UA stack option
shall have client functionality. This enables the RNC to report to the
MSC when it is a newly introduced entity in the network.

3\. **SCTP** refers to the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (IETF
RFC 2960 \[16\]) developed by the Sigtran working group of the IETF for
the purpose of transporting various signalling protocols over IP
networks. The checksum method specified in IETF RFC 3309 \[30\] shall be
used instead of the method specified in IETF RFC 2960 \[16\].
Multi-homing is a way to achieve redundancy with SCTP between two
endpoints, of which one or both is assigned with multiple IP addresses.
SCTP endpoints shall support a multi-homed remote SCTP endpoint.

4\. **IP**. IPv6 shall be supported according to IETF RFC 2460 \[25\].
IPv4 support (IETF RFC 791 \[13\]) is optional.

> Note: This does not preclude the single implementation and use of
> Ipv4.
>
> Due to the possible transition from IPv4 to IPv6 the IP dual stack
> support is recommended.

An RNC/CN using IP transport option shall support Diffserv code point
marking IETF RFC 2474 \[26\]. The Diffserv code point may be determined
from the application parameters.

5.3 Signalling Bearer for Packet Switched Domain
------------------------------------------------

### 5.3.1 Protocol Stack for the PS Domain

The protocol stacks for the PS Domain is shown in figure 2. The standard
allows operators to choose one out of three standardised protocol suites
for transport of SCCP messages.

service, class 0, connection oriented service, class 2, separation of
the connections mobile by mobile basis on the connection oriented link
and establishment of a connection oriented link mobile by mobile basis.
The SCCP shall be used as specified in TS 25.410 \[18\].

2\. **MTP3-B** (ITU-T Rec. Q.2210 \[4\] or ANSI T1.111-2001 \[31\])
provides message routing, discrimination and distribution (for
point-to-point link only), signalling link management load sharing and
changeover/back between link within one link-set. The need for multiple

ends of an SCTP-association to enable transport redundancy and
reliability. **M3UA**. An implementation of SCTP to this document shall
utilise the new checksum method specified in IETF RFC 3309 \[30\]
instead of the method specified in IETF RFC 2960 \[16\].

determined from the application parameters.

5.4 Services Provided by the Signalling Bearer
----------------------------------------------

When considering the requirements that the upper layers, i.e. RANAP,
have on the Signalling Bearer, there are a number of services it has to
