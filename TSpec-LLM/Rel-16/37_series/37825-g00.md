In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:

**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something

**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something

The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the
context of normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.

The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes
for \"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as
possible, and they are not used in a normative context except in a
direct citation from an external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so
as to maintain continuity of style when extending or modifying the
provisions of such a referenced document.

**should** indicates a recommendation to do something

**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something

**may** indicates permission to do something

The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\"
are used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.

**can** indicates that something is possible

**cannot** indicates that something is impossible

The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\"
and \"need not\".

**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a
result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to
happen as a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which
is outside the scope of the present document

**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result

result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

In addition:

**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement
of fact

**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates
a statement of fact

The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

4.1 Justification
-----------------

In order to reduce the big imbalance between 5G NR uplink and downlink
coverage, RAN4 has completed PC2 HPUE feature to improve the uplink
coverage for 5G SA deployments on NR bands n41, n77, n78 and n79 in
Rel-15 NR WI, including PC2 UL MIMO (2Tx 23+23dBm) and PC2 1Tx (26dBm)
UE. The following NR bands were approved to support PC2 HPUE for 5G NR
SA in Rel-15：

-   Band n41 (2496 -- 2690 MHz)：

UL-MIMO (2Tx 23+23dBm) and 1Tx (26dBm) are supported for NR Band n41

-   Band n77 (3.3 - 4.2 GHz)：

UL-MIMO (2Tx 23+23dBm) and 1Tx (26dBm) are supported for NR Band n77

-   Band n78 (3.3 - 3.8 GHz)：

UL-MIMO (2Tx 23+23dBm) and 1Tx (26dBm) are supported for NR Band n78

-   Band n79 (4.4 - 5 GHz)：

UL-MIMO (2Tx 23+23dBm) and 1Tx (26dBm) are supported for NR Band n79

For 5G NR NSA deployment, the imbalance between UL and DL coverage still
exists, and the uplink coverage for EN-DC is also need to be improved.
Considering the technical status of the industry chain, the Power Class
2 (+26dBm) EN-DC UE should be the most practical and suitable choice to
improve the UL coverage for 5G NR NSA deployment.

It is proposed to specify Power Class 2 UE for EN-DC (1LTE band +1 NR
band) supporting +26 dBm. PC2 EN-DC for TDD-TDD band combinations are
proposed in this Work Item. This Work Item is to develop a new feature
to enable Power Class 2 EN-DC UE with 26 dBm maximum output power.

4.2 Objective
-------------

The objective of the work item is to specify the RF requirements for
Power Class 2 EN-DC (1 LTE band (PC3) +1 NR band (PC3) with 1Tx).

-   Specify the band combination specific RF requirements for all listed
    PC2 EN-DC configurations consisting of 2 different bands DL with 2
    different bands UL (1 LTE band and 1 NR band) including at least

    -   Applicable frequencies if necessary

    -   Applicable bandwidths and bandwidth sets if necessary

    -   **UE requirements, including** UE maximum output power, **Tx
        power tolerance, MPR, A-MPR, IBE and ACLR for Power Class 2
        EN-DC, taking into account the potential coexistence with Band
        40 in China**

-   Analyse combinations that have self-desensitization due to following
    reasons:

    -   TX Harmonic and/or intermodulation overlap of receive band

    -   TX signal overlap of receiver harmonic frequency

    -   TX frequency being in close proximity of one of the receive
        bands

    -   Any other identified reasons

-   For the combination where self-desensitization exists:

    -   ∆T~IB,\ c~ and ∆R~IB,\ c~

    -   Reference sensitivity exceptions including MSD test cases

-   UE Tx duty cycle requirements sufficient to prevent exceeding local
    regulatory limits such as SAR

-   Regulatory issues related to the use of PC2 EN-DC capable devices
    when roaming and/or p-max absence shall be addressed.

-   Simultaneous RxTx UE capability for PC2 EN-DC band combinations
    shall be decided

-   Release independent issue is to be considered for PC2 EN-DC

-   RAN4 needs to discuss whether existing RAN2 signalling can be reused
    to solve the issues in this WI. If there is RAN2 signalling impact
    then RAN4 will send LS to RAN2 to inform the solution. No RAN2 TUs
    are requested for this WI.

**This WI is aimed to specify the category of PC2 EN-DC band
combinations consisting of 2 different bands DL with 2 different bands
UL (1 LTE band and 1 NR band). An overview table of these PC2** EN-DC
configurations **is provided here:**

5 High power UE (power class 2) for EN-DC (1 LTE TDD band + 1 NR TDD band): General Part
========================================================================================

5.1 Output power and TX power tolerance
---------------------------------------

For EN-DC with 1 LTE TDD band and 1 NR TDD band, UE maximum output power
shall be measured over all component carriers from different bands. If
each band has separate antenna connectors, maximum output power is
measured as the sum of maximum output power at each UE antenna
connector. The period of measurement shall be at least one sub frame
(1ms). The maximum output power is specified in Table 5.1-1.

+------------------------------------------------+------+------------+

For intra-band non-contiguous EN-DC, the EN-DC Adjacent Channel Leakage
power Ratio (EN-DCACLR) is the ratio of the sum of the filtered mean
powers centered on the assigned E-UTRA and NR sub-block frequencies to
the filtered mean power centered on an adjacent channel frequency at
nominal channel spacing. In case the sub-block gap bandwidth Wgap is
smaller than a E-UTRA or NR sub-block bandwidth, no EN-DCACLR
requirement is set for the corresponding sub-block for the gap. The
assigned EN-DC sub-block power and adjacent channel power are measured
with rectangular filters with measurement bandwidths specified in \[4\]
for the E-UTRA sub-block, and \[2\], \[3\] for the NR sub-block. If the
measured adjacent channel power is greater than --50dBm then the
EN-DCACLR shall be higher than the value specified in for E-UTRAACLR and
NRACLR

The ACLR requirements specified in sub-clause 6.6.2.3 of TS 36.101\[4\]
