 Foreword
========

This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:

**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something

**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something

The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the
context of normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.

The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes
for \"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as
possible, and they are not used in a normative context except in a
direct citation from an external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so
as to maintain continuity of style when extending or modifying the
provisions of such a referenced document.

**should** indicates a recommendation to do something

**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something

**may** indicates permission to do something

**need not** indicates permission not to do something

The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\"
are used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.

**can** indicates that something is possible

**cannot** indicates that something is impossible

The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\"
and \"need not\".

**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a
result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to
happen as a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which
is outside the scope of the present document

**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result
of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document

**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

In addition:

**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement
of fact

**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates
a statement of fact

The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

 1 Scope
=======

The present document specifies the conducted test methods and
conformance requirements for *single RAT E-UTRA operation*, *single RAT
UTRA operation* (FDD and TDD) and Multi-Standard Radio (MSR) UTRA,
E-UTRA and NR Active Antenna System (AAS) Base Station (BS). These have
been derived from, and are consistent with the non-AAS BS specifications
in TS 25.104 \[2\], TS 25.105 \[3\], TS 36.104 \[4\], TS 38.104 \[36\]
or TS 37.104 \[5\]. The technical specification TS 37.145 is in 2 parts,
part TS 37.145-1 (the present document) covers conducted requirements
and part TS 37.145-2 \[40\] covers radiated requirements.

The present document does not establish conducted test methods and
conformance requirements for Band 46 operation as it is not supported by
AAS BS, but Band 46 test requirements are still applicable for AAS BS
for protection of and against Band 46 operation.

The present document does not establish conducted test methods and
conformance requirements for Narrow-Band Internet of Things (NB-IoT) in
band, NB-IoT guard band, or standalone NB-IoT operation, for AAS BS in
*single RAT E-UTRA operation* as defined in TS 36.141 \[14\], or for AAS
BS in *MSR operation* using E-UTRA as defined in TS 37.141 \[13\].

==========================================

4.1 Measurement uncertainties and test requirements
---------------------------------------------------

### 4.1.1 General

The requirements of this clause apply to all applicable tests in part 1
of this specification, i.e. to all conducted test

The minimum requirements are given in TS 37.105 \[6\] and the references
therein. Test requirements are given in this specification or are
included by reference to TS 25.141 \[15\], TS 25.142 \[19\],
TS 36.141 \[14\], TS 38.141-1 \[37\] or TS 37.141 \[13\]. Test
Tolerances for the conducted test requirements explicitly stated in the
present document are given in annex C of the present document. Test
Tolerances for test requirements included by reference to
TS 25.141 \[15\], TS 25.142 \[19\], TS 36.141 \[14\], TS 38.141-1 \[37\]
or TS 37.141 \[13\] are defined in the respective referred test
specification.

Test requirements and Test Tolerances for NB-IoT in-band, NB-IoT guard
band, or standalone NB-IoT operation are not supported by AAS BS and not
covered by this specification. When referring to standalone E-UTRA test
requirements for *single RAT operation* in TS 36.141 \[14\] or to E-UTRA
test requirements for *MSR operation* in TS 37.141 \[13\], any test
requirements specified in those specifications for E-UTRA with NB-IoT
(in-band or guard band) or for standalone NB-IoT, shall not be
considered for the AAS BS. Unless otherwise stated, the exclusion of the
NB-IoT test requirements in this specification applies to all operation
modes (i.e. *in-band NB-IoT operation*, *guard band NB-IoT operation*
and *standalone NB-IoT operation*).

Test Tolerances are individually calculated for each test. The Test
Tolerances are used to relax the minimum requirements to create test
requirements.

When a test requirement differs from the corresponding minimum
requirement, then the Test Tolerance applied for the test is non-zero.
The Test Tolerance for the test and the explanation of how the minimum
requirement has been relaxed by the Test Tolerance are given in annex C.

### 4.1.2 Acceptable uncertainty of Test System

#### 4.1.2.1 General

The maximum acceptable uncertainty of the Test System is specified below
for each test defined explicitly in the present specification, where
appropriate. The maximum acceptable uncertainty of the Test System for
test requirements included by reference is defined in the respective
referred test specification.

When a requirement is applied per *TAB connector* then the test
uncertainty is applied to the measured value. When a requirement is
applied for a group of *TAB connectors* then the test uncertainty is
applied to sum of the measured power on each *TAB connector* in the
group.

The Test System shall enable the stimulus signals in the test case to be
adjusted to within the specified tolerance and the equipment under test
to be measured with an uncertainty not exceeding the specified values.
All tolerances and uncertainties are absolute values, and are valid for
a confidence level of 95 %, unless otherwise stated.

A confidence level of 95 % is the measurement uncertainty tolerance
interval for a specific measurement that contains 95 % of the
performance of a population of test equipment.

For RF tests, it should be noted that the uncertainties in clause 4.1.2
apply to the Test System operating into a nominal 50 ohm load and do not
include system effects due to mismatch between the DUT and the Test
System.

### 4.1.3 Interpretation of measurement results

The measurement results returned by the Test System are compared -
without any modification - against the test requirements as defined by
the Shared Risk principle.

The Shared Risk principle is defined in Recommendation
ITU-R M.1545 \[7\].

The actual measurement uncertainty of the Test System for the
measurement of each parameter shall be included in the test report.

The recorded value for the Test System uncertainty shall be, for each
measurement, equal to or lower than the appropriate figure in
clause 4.1.2 of the present document.

If the Test System for a test is known to have a measurement uncertainty
greater than that specified in clause 4.1.2, it is still permitted to
use this apparatus provided that an adjustment is made as follows.

Any additional uncertainty in the Test System over and above that
specified in clause 4.1.2 shall be used to tighten the test requirement,
making the test harder to pass. For some tests e.g. receiver tests, this
may require modification of stimulus signals. This procedure will ensure
that a Test System not compliant with clause 4.1.2 does not increase the
chance of passing a device under test where that device would otherwise
have failed the test if a Test System compliant with clause 4.1.2 had
been used.

4.2 Conducted and radiated requirement reference points
-------------------------------------------------------

AAS BS requirements are defined for two points of reference, signified
by radiated requirements and conducted requirements.

Figure 4.2-1: Radiated and conducted points of reference of AAS BS

Radiated characteristics are defined over the air (OTA) with a point of
reference in the far field (Fraunhofer) region. Radiated requirements
are also referred to as OTA requirements.

Conducted characteristics are defined at individual or groups of *TAB
connectors* at the *transceiver array boundary*, which is the conducted
interface between the transceiver unit array and the composite antenna.

The transceiver unit array is part of the composite transceiver
functionality generating modulated transmit signal structures and
performing receiver combining and demodulation.

The transceiver unit array contains an implementation specific number of
transmitter units and an implementation specific number of receiver
units. Transmitter units and receiver units may be combined into
transceiver units. The transmitter/receiver units have the ability to
receive/send parallel independent modulated symbol streams.

The composite antenna contains a *radio distribution network* (RDN) and
an antenna array. The RDN is a linear passive network that distributes
the RF power between the *transceiver array boundary* and the antenna
array, in an implementation specific way.

How a conducted requirement is applied to the *transceiver array
boundary* is detailed in the respective requirement clause.

Part 1 of this specification details the test requirements of the
conducted requirements only and hence only requires the conducted
reference points.

4.3 Base station classes for AAS BS
-----------------------------------

The requirements in this specification apply to AAS BS of Wide Area BS,
Medium Range BS and Local Area BS classes unless otherwise stated.

Wide Area BS are characterised by requirements derived from Macro Cell
scenarios. For a hybrid *AAS BS* of Wide Area BS class, the minimum
coupling loss between any *TAB connector* and the UE is 70 dB.

NOTE: Whenever WA BS is referred in this specification, the NB-IoT Wide
Area BS and related requiremetns as defined in TS 36.104 \[4\], are not
applicable for AAS BS.

Medium Range BS are characterised by requirements derived from Micro
Cell scenarios. For a hybrid *AAS BS* of Medium Range BS class, the
minimum coupling loss between any *TAB connector* and the UE is 53 dB.

Local Area BS are characterised by requirements derived from Pico Cell
scenarios. For a hybrid *AAS BS* of Local Area BS class, the minimum
coupling loss between any *TAB connector* and the UE is 45 dB.

4.4 Regional requirements
-------------------------

Some requirements in the present document may only apply in certain
regions either as optional requirements, or set by local and regional
regulation as mandatory requirements. It is normally not stated in the
3GPP specifications under what exact circumstances that the requirements
apply, since this is defined by local or regional regulation.

Table 4.4-1 lists all requirements in the present specification that may
be applied differently in different regions. Non-AAS requirements are
applicable as defined in the present document. In many cases, such
requirements include regional requirements that are implicitly
referenced from the present specification, and listed in the
specification for the specifications concerned \[2\] \[5\].

Table 4.4-1: List of regional requirements

  --------------- ------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Clause number   Requirement                           Comments

  --------------- ------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.5 Operating bands and band categories
---------------------------------------

The operating bands and band categories for AAS BS are the same as for
*non-AAS BS*, as described in TS 37.104 \[5\]. In addition, band
category aspects described in TS 37.141, clauses 4.4.1, 4.4.2 and 4.4.3,
shall apply.

NOTE 1: *AAS BS* does not support GSM, but BC2 is still applicable for
protection of/against GSM operation in BC2 operating bands.

NOTE 2: AAS BS does not support Band 46 (and all its sub-bands defined
in TS 36.104 \[12\], clause 5.5) operation, but Band 46 test
requirements are still applicable for AAS BS for protection of and
against Band 46 operation.

NOTE 3: Bands in BC1 and BC2 categories are also used for NB-IoT
operation. NB-IoT is not applicable for AAS BS.

4.6 Channel arrangements
------------------------

The channel arrangements for AAS BS are the same as those for UTRA
*non-AAS BS* and/or E-UTRA *non-AAS BS* and/or NR *non-AAS BS* as
described in TS 37.104 \[5\].

NOTE: Test requirements for nominal carrier spacing of 19.8 MHz and 20.1
MHz for carriers in Band 46 as specified in 36.104 \[12\] clause 5.7.1,
are not applicable for AAS BS.

4.7 Requirements for AAS BS capable of multi-band operation
-----------------------------------------------------------

For AAS BS capable of operation in multiple operating bands, the RF
requirements in clause 6 and 7 apply separately to each supported
operating band unless otherwise stated.

An AAS BS may be capable of supporting operation in multiple operating
bands with one of the following implementations of *TAB connectors* in
the *transceiver array boundary*:

\- All TAB connectors are single band TAB connectors:

\- Different sets of *single band TAB connectors* support different
operating bands, but each *TAB connector* supports only operation in one
single operating band.

\- Sets of *single band TAB connectors* support operation in multiple
operating bands with some *single band TAB connectors* supporting more
than one operating band.

\- All TAB connectors are multiband TAB connectors.

\- A combination of single band sets and multi-band sets of TAB
connectors provides support of the AAS BS capability of operation in
multiple operating bands.

Unless otherwise stated all requirements specified for an operating band
apply only to the set of *TAB connectors* supporting that operating
band.

In certain requirements it is explicitly stated that specific additions
or exclusions to the requirement apply at *multi-band TAB connectors* as
detailed in the requirement clause.

In the case of an operating band being supported only by *single band
TAB connectors* in a *TAB connector TX min cell group* or a *TAB
connector RX min cell group*, *single band requirements* apply to that
set of *TAB connectors*.

NOTE: Each supported operating band needs to be operated separately
during conformance testing on *single band TAB connectors*.

In the case of an operating band being supported only by *multi-band TAB
connector*s supporting the same operating band combination in a *TAB
connector TX min cell group* or a *TAB connector RX min cell group*,
*multi-band requirements* apply to that set of *TAB connectors*.

The case of an operating band being supported by both *multi-band TAB
connectors* and *single band TAB connectors* in a *TAB connector TX min
cell group* or a *TAB connector RX min cell group* is not covered by the
present release of this specification.

The case of an operating band being supported by *multi-band TAB
connectors* which are not all supporting the same operating band
combination in a *TAB connector TX min cell group* or a *TAB connector
RX min cell group* is not covered by the present release of this
specification.

For *multi-band TAB connectors* supporting the bands for TDD, the RF
requirements in the present specification assume no simultaneous uplink
and downlink occur between the bands.

The RF requirements for *multi-band TAB connectors* supporting bands for
both FDD and TDD are not covered by the present release of this
specification.

4.8 AAS BS configurations
-------------------------

### 4.8.1 Transmit configurations

Unless otherwise stated, the conducted transmitter characteristics in
clause 6 are specified at the AAS BS *transceiver array boundary* at the
*TAB connector(s)* antenna connector with a full complement of
transceiver units for the configuration in normal operating conditions.

Figure 4.8.1-1: Transmitter test ports

Unless otherwise stated, for the tests in clause 6 of the present
document, the requirement applies for each transmit *TAB connector.*

### 4.8.2 Receive configurations

Unless otherwise stated, the conducted receiver characteristics in
clause 7 are specified at the *TAB connector* with a full complement of
transceiver units for the configuration in normal operating conditions.

Figure 4.8.2-1: Receiver test ports

For the tests in clause 7 of the present document, the requirement
applies at each receive *TAB connector*.

Conducted receive requirements are tested at the *TAB connector*, with
the remaining receiver units(s) disabled or their *TAB connector*(s)
being terminated.

### 4.8.3 Power supply options

If the AAS BS is supplied with a number of different power supply
configurations, it may not be necessary to test RF parameters for each
of the power supply options, provided that it can be demonstrated that
the range of conditions over which the equipment is tested is at least
as great as the range of conditions due to any of the power supply
configurations.

### 4.8.4 BS with integrated Iuant BS modem

Unless otherwise stated, for the tests in the present document, the
integrated Iuant BS modem shall be switched off. Spurious emissions
according to clauses 6.6.4 and 7.6 shall be measured only for
frequencies above 20 MHz with the integrated Iuant BS modem switched on.

4.9 Capability sets
-------------------

Capability set is defined as the *TAB connectors* capability to support
certain RAT combinations in an operating band.

The manufacturer shall declare (D6.12) the supported capability set(s)
according to table 4.9-1 for each supported *TAB connector(s)* and
supported operating band(s).

The applicable test configurations for each RF requirement are defined
in clauses 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 for the declared capability set(s). For a
*multi-band TAB connector* the applicable test configurations for each
RF requirement are defined in clause 5.4 for the declared capability
set(s).

NOTE: Not every supported configuration within a capability set is
tested, but the tables in clauses 5.2, 5.3 and 5.4 provide a judicious
choice among the supported configurations and test configurations to
ensure proper test coverage.

4.13 Format and interpretation of tests
---------------------------------------

Each test in the following clauses has a standard format:

**X Title**

All tests are applicable to all equipment within the scope of the
present document, unless otherwise stated.

**X.1 Definition and applicability**

This clause gives the general definition of the parameter under
consideration and specifies whether the test is applicable to all
equipment or only to a certain subset. Required manufacturer
declarations may be included here.

**X.2 Minimum requirement**

This clause contains the reference to the clause to the 3GPP reference
(or core) specification which defines the minimum requirement. For each
requirement, there are separate references for MSR and single RAT, where
applicable in the core requirement. If the requirement does not apply to
a particular RAT, this is explicitly stated here (rather than through a
reference).

**X.3 Test purpose**

This clause defines the purpose of the test.

**X.4 Method of test**

**X.4.1 General**

In some cases there are alternative test procedures or initial
conditions. In such cases, guidance for which initial conditions and
test procedures can be applied are stated here. In the case only one
test procedure is applicable, that is stated here. Guidance to which TAB
connectors are subject to the test is also given here.

**X.4.2y First test method**

**X.4.2y.1 Initial conditions**

This clause defines the initial conditions for each test, including the
test environment, the RF channels to be tested and the basic measurement
set-up. The test system is assumed to be correctly calibrated as part of
the initial conditions. Calibration is not explicitly mentioned.

**X.4.2y.2 Procedure**

This clause describes the steps necessary to perform the test and
provides further details of the test definition like point of access
(e.g. test port), domain (e.g. frequency-span), range, weighting (e.g.
bandwidth), and algorithms (e.g. averaging). The procedure may comprise
data processing of the measurement result before comparison with the
test requirement (e.g. average result from several measurement
positions).

**X.4.3y Alternative test method (if any)**

If there are alternative test methods, each is described with its
initial conditions and procedures.

**X.5 Test requirement**

This clause defines the pass/fail criteria for the equipment under test,
see clause 4.1.3 Interpretation of measurement results. Test
requirements for every minimum requirement referred in clause X.2 are
listed here. Cases where minimum requirements do not apply need not be
mentioned.

The test requirements may be different depending on the test method
applied. A test requirement for each test method applicable to the
respective MSR/Single RAT requirement is given in separate clauses where
applicable.

5 Applicability of Requirements
===============================

5.1 General
-----------

The present clause defines for each conducted test requirement the set
of mandatory test configurations which shall be used for demonstrating
conformance for each *TAB connector*.

Test configurations for *TAB connectors* supporting multiple RAT in the
tested operating band are specified in subclause 5.2.

Test configurations for *TAB connectors* declared to support single RAT
requirements (see table 4.10-1, D6.13) by either MSR requirements for
UTRA only or E-UTRA only or with a single-RAT UTRA requirements or
single RAT E-UTRA requirements are specified in subclause 5.3.

Test configurations for *Multi-band TAB connectors* are specified in
subclause 5.4.

Requirements apply to *TAB connectors* according to the declared RAT
Capability Set (see table 4.10-1, D6.12) within each supported operating
band and capability set of the *TAB connector* and the Band Category of
the declared operating band (see table 4.10-1, D6.1), as listed in the
heading of each table. Some RF requirements listed in the tables may not
be mandatory or they may apply only regionally. This is further
specified for each requirement in subclauses 6 and 7, and in table
4.4-1.

For a declared RAT Capability Set (see table 4.10-1, D6.12) in tables
5.2-1, 5.3.2-1, 5.3.3-1, 5.3.4-1, 5.4.1-1 or 5.4.2.1 only the
requirements listed in the column for that Capability Set apply.
Requirements listed under CSA other than the declared CSA(s) need not be
tested. In case the BS is declared to support more than one CS, the
tests that are common between different supported CSs are not repeated.

For a *TAB connector* declared to support MSR and to be capable of
contiguous spectrum operation only, the test configuration(s) in tables
5.2-1 and 5.3.2-1 denoted by a \"C\" and entries that refer to
single-RAT specifications shall be used for testing.

For a *TAB connector* that is declared: to support MSR and to be capable
of contiguous and non-contiguous spectrum operation (see table 4.10-1,
D6.14), where the parameters according to clause 4.10 are identical for
contiguous and non-contiguous operation (see table 4.10-1, D6.15), shall
use for each declared operating band the test configuration(s) in tables
5.2-1 and 5.3.2-1 denoted by \"CNC\" and entries that refer to
single-RAT specifications shall be used.

For a *TAB connector* that is declared: to support MSR and to be capable
of contiguous and non-contiguous spectrum operation (see table 4.10-1,
D6.14), where the parameters according to clause 4.10 are not identical
for contiguous and non-contiguous operation (see table 4.10-1, D6.15),
shall use for each declared operating band the test configuration(s) in
tables 5.2-1 and 5.3.2-1 denoted by \"C/NC\" and entries that refer to
single-RAT specifications shall be used.

For a MSR capable *multi-band TAB connector* the applicability of the
requirement for each operating band is determined by the RAT
configuration within that operating band as identified in tables 5.2-1
and 5.3.2-1, unless otherwise stated. The testing of MSR capable
*multi-band TAB connectors* shall be according to table 5.4.1-1 as
follows:

\- For requirements test denoted by SBT (Single Band Test), the test
configuration(s) in tables 5.2-1 and 5.3.2-1 shall be used for each
operating band depending on the RAT configuration within that band.

\- For requirements test denoted by MBT (Multi-Band Test), the test
configuration(s) in table 5.4.1-1 shall be used depending on the Band
Category of the declared operating band combination.

For a single-RAT UTRA only *TAB connector* for each declared operating
band clause 5.3.3 defines for each conducted test requirement the set of
mandatory test configurations which shall be used for demonstrating
conformance. The applicable test configurations are specified in table
5.3.3-1 for each supported RF configuration, which shall be declared
according to clause 4.10. The generation and power allocation for each
test configuration is defined in clause 4.11.2.

For a single-RAT E-UTRA only *TAB connector* for each declared operating
band clause 5.3.4 defines for each conducted test requirement the set of
mandatory test configurations which shall be used for demonstrating
conformance. The applicable test configurations are specified in table
5.3.4-1 for each supported RF configuration, which shall be declared
according to clause 4.10. The generation and power allocation for each
test configuration is defined in clause 4.11.2.

For a *TAB connector* declared to be capable of single carrier operation
only in an operating band (see table 4.10-1, D6.23), a single carrier
(SC) shall be used for testing.

5.3 Test configurations for multi-carrier capable TAB connector(s) in operating bands where one RAT capability sets are supported
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 5.3.1 General

A *TAB connector* may support only one RAT operation in an operating
band by fulfilling different sets of requirements. Both UTRA and E-UTRA
have two complete sets of requirements that may be fulfilled depending
on whether the TAB connector is declared to be MSR or single RAT in the
operating band. MSR and single RAT requirements are addressed separately
by separate test requirements (and corresponding core requirements).
They are also identified by different capability sets as described in
clauses 4.11 and 5.2.

### 5.3.2 TAB connector supporting one RAT only MSR in the operating band

This clause contains test configuration applicability to requirements
and capability sets for *TAB connectors* supporting one RAT only MSR
operation operating with multiple carriers (MC).

capability sets for TAB connectors supporting one RAT only MSR operation

### 5.3.3 TAB connector supporting Single-RAT UTRA in the operating band

This clause contains the test configurations for TAB connectors
supporting single-RAT UTRA in the operating band. The test
configurations apply to *TAB connectors* operating with multiple
carriers (MC).

For a *TAB connector* declared to support multi-carrier operation in
contiguous spectrum operation in single band only, the test
configurations in the second column of table 5.3.3-1 for FDD, and in the
fifth column of table 5.3.3-1 for TDD, shall be used for testing.

NOTE: The applicability of test configurations for TDD in this clause is
only applicable to UTRA TDD 1,28 Mcps option.

For FDD a *TAB connector* declared to support multi-carrier operation in
contiguous and non-contiguous spectrum in single band and where the
parameters in the manufacture\'s declaration according to clause 4.10
are identical for contiguous (C) and non-contiguous (NC) spectrum
operation, the test configurations in the third column of table 5.3.3‑1
shall be used for testing.

For FDD a *TAB connector* declared to support multi-carrier operation in
contiguous and non-contiguous spectrum in single band and where the
parameters in the manufacture\'s declaration according to clause 4.10
are not identical for contiguous and non-contiguous spectrum operation,
the test configurations in the fourth column of table 5.3.3-1 shall be
used for testing.

Table 5.3.3-1: Test configurations for a *TAB connector* supporting

### 5.3.4 TAB connector supporting Single-RAT E-UTRA in the operating band

This clause contains the test configurations for TAB connectors
supporting single-RAT E-UTRA in the operating band. The test
configurations apply to *TAB connectors* operating with multiple
carriers (MC).

For a *TAB connector* declared to support multi-carrier and/or CA
operation in contiguous spectrum operation in single band only, the test
configurations in the second column of table 5.3.4-1 shall be used for
testing.

For a *TAB connector* declared to support multi-carrier and/or CA
operation in contiguous and non-contiguous spectrum in single band and
where the parameters in the manufacture\'s declaration according to
clause 4.10 are identical for contiguous (C) and non-contiguous (NC)
spectrum operation, the test configurations in the third column of table
5.3.4-1 shall be used for testing.

For a *TAB connector* declared to support multi-carrier and/or CA in
contiguous and non-contiguous spectrum in single band and where the
parameters in the manufacture\'s declaration according to clause 4.10
are not identical for contiguous and non-contiguous spectrum operation,
the test configurations in the fourth column of table 5.3.4-1 shall be
used for testing.

6 Conducted transmitter characteristics
=======================================

6.1 General
-----------

General test conditions for transmitter tests are given in clause 4,
including interpretation of measurement results and configurations for
testing. BS configurations for the tests are defined in clause 4.8.

If a number of *TAB connectors* have been declared equivalent (see table
4.10-1, D6.70), only a representative one is necessary to be tested to
demonstrate conformance.

In clause 6.6.3.1, if representative *TAB connectors* are used then per
connector criteria (i.e. option 2) shall be applied.

*The manufacturer shall declare the minimum number of supported
geographical cells (i.e. geographical areas). The minimum number of
supported geographical cells (N~cells~) relates to the AAS BS setting
with the minimum amount of cell splitting supported with transmission on
all TAB connectors supporting the operating band. The manufacturer shall
also declare TAB connector TX min cell groups.* Every *TAB connector*
supporting transmission in an operating band shall map to one *TAB
connector TX min cell group* supporting the same operating band*. The
mapping of TAB connectors to cells is implementation dependent.*

*The number of active transmitter units that are considered when
calculating the emissions limit (N~TXU,\ counted~) for an AAS BS is
calculated as follows:*

N~TXU,\ counted~ = *min(N~TXU,active~ , 8·N~cells~)* for E-UTRA single
RAT AAS BS and MSR AAS BS (except UTRA only MSR AAS BS); and

N~TXU,\ counted~ = *min(N~TXU,active~, 4·N~cells~)* for UTRA single RAT
AAS BS and UTRA only MSR AAS BS

Further:

N~TXU,countedpercell~ = *N~TXU,counted~/N~cells~*

N~TXU,countedpercell~ is used for scaling the *basic limits* as
described in clause 6.6.

NOTE: N~TXU,active~ depends on the actual number of *active transmitter
unit*s and is independent to the declaration of N~cells~.

Any transmitter test requirement specified for Band 46 operation in
TS 36.104 \[4\] for E-UTRA, or in TS 37.104 \[5\] for E-UTRA in MSR
operation, and referred in clause 6, is not applicable for AAS BS.

Any transmitter test requirement specified for NB-IoT in-band, NB-IoT
guard band, or standalone NB-IoT operation in TS 36.141 \[14\] for
E-UTRA with NB-IoT (in-band or guard band) or for standalone NB-IoT, or
in TS 37.141 \[13\] for E-UTRA with NB-IoT or standalone NB-IoT in *MSR
operation*, and referred in clause 6, is not applicable for AAS BS.

### 6.2.5 UTRA FDD additional CPICH power for MIMO mode

#### 6.2.5.1 Definition and applicability

This clause includes requirements on secondary CPICH power level, for
two and four *TAB connector* groups, as well as Demodulation CPICH
requirements. The requirements apply to all *TAB connector* groups
associated with UTRA FDD MIMO transmission as \"antenna 2\", \"antenna
3\" or \"antenna 4\" in the *AAS BS*.

The concept of \"antenna 2\", \"antenna 3\" and \"antenna 4\" is
described in TS 25.104 \[2\]. The group(s) of *TAB connector*s mapped to
P-CPICH transmission (see table 4.10-1 D6.45) represents \"antenna 1\".

NOTE 1: The manufacturer declares the mapping of *TAB connector*s to
\"antenna 1\", \"antenna 2\", \"antenna 3\" and \"antenna 4\" (as
defined in TS 25.331 \[16\]) where applicable for AAS BS capable of UTRA
FDD operation. The required declarations are specified clause 4.10.

For UTRA FDD *AAS BS* operating only \"antenna 1\" and \"antenna 2\",
the secondary CPICH (S-CPICH) power is the *code domain power* of the
Secondary Common Pilot Channel. S-CPICH power is equal to the (dB) sum
of the P‑CPICH power and the power offset, which are signalled to the
UE. The power offset is signalled in the IE \"Power Offset for S-CPICH
for MIMO\", for MIMO mode as defined in clause 10.3.6.41b in
TS 25.331 \[16\].

When the UE supports MIMO mode with four BS transmit antennas, the power
offset of S-CPICH on antenna 2 is signalled in the IE \"Power Offset for
S-CPICH for MIMO mode with four transmit antennas on Antenna2\" as
defined in clause 10.3.6.143 in TS 25.331 \[16\]. The power offset of
S-CPICH on antenna 3 and 4 is signalled in the IE \"Common Power Offset
for S-CPICH for MIMO mode with four transmit antennas on antenna 3 and
4\", as defined in clause 10.3.6.143 in TS 25.331 \[16\].

Demodulation CPICH (D-CPICH) power is the *code domain power* of the
Demodulation Common Pilot Channel. D‑CPICH power is equal to the (dB)
sum of the P-CPICH power and the power offset, which are signalled to
the UE. The power offset of D-CPICH on antenna 3 and 4 is signalled in
the IE \"Common Power Offset for D-CPICH for MIMO mode with four
transmit antennas on antenna 3 and 4\", as defined in clause 10.3.6.143
in TS 25.331 \[16\].

NOTE 2: The accuracy level of the power offset for S-CPICH may affect
both MIMO HS-DSCH demodulation and CQI reporting performance.

NOTE 3: The accuracy level of the power offset for D-CPICH transmitted
on antennas 3 and 4 may affect both MIMO HS-DSCH demodulation and CQI
reporting performance.

NOTE 4: At high geometry level PDSCH performance may be affected if
D-CPICH is not scheduled.

NOTE 5: A *TAB connector* group may comprise all *TAB connectors*.

NOTE 6: A *TAB connector* may be mapped to several groups.

groups (see table 4.10-1, D6.49), to output a signal in accordance to
TM2, in TS 25.141 \[18\], clause 6.1.1.2.

NOTE: Although the S-CPICH transmission groups are referred to as
S-CPICH as the same TM2 is used for the test, the signal being measured
on the S-CPICH transmission groups is actually a P-CPICH signal.

##### 6.2.5.4.2 Procedure

The minimum requirement is applied to all *TAB connectors* in the
P-CPICH transmission group transmitting primary CPICH and the *TAB
connectors* in the S-CPICH transmission groups. *TAB connectors* may be
tested one at a time or multiple *TAB connectors* may be tested in
parallel as shown in clause D.1.1. Whichever method is used the
procedure is repeated until all *TAB connectors* necessary to
demonstrate conformance have been tested.

D.1.1. All *TAB connectors* not under test shall be terminated.

2\) Set the *TAB connector* to transmit at manufacturers declared *rated
carrier output power per TAB connector* (P~Rated,c,TABC~).

connector(s)* in the P-CPICH transmission groups according to annex E in
TS 25.141 \[18\].

4\) Measure the P-CPICH power in the same timeslot as step 2 on each of
the *TAB connector(s)* in each of the S‑CPICH transmission groups
according to annex E in TS 25.141 \[18\]. Depending on the MIMO support
(see table 4.10-1, D6.49), for MIMO mode there is a single S-CPICH
transmission group representing \"antenna 2\" and for MIMO with 4
transmit antennas there are three S-CPICH transmission groups
representing \"antenna 2\", \"antenna 3\" and \"antenna 4\".

In addition, for *multi-band TAB connector(s)*, the following steps
shall apply:

5\) For *multi-band TAB connectors* and single band tests, repeat the
steps above per involved band where single band test configurations and
test models shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

#### 6.2.5.5 Test requirements

For UTRA FDD the test requirement for CPICH power for MIMO mode is:

Either:

### 6.3.4 Total power dynamic range

#### 6.3.4.1 Definition and applicability

The total power dynamic range is the difference between the maximum and
the minimum output power for a specified reference condition.

This requirement applies at each *TAB connector* supporting transmission
in the operating band.

NOTE 1: The upper limit of the dynamic range is the *TAB connector*
maximum output power (P~Rated,c,TABC~). The lower limit of the dynamic
range is the lowest minimum power from the *TAB connector* when no
traffic channels are activated.

Particularly for E-UTRA, the total power dynamic range is the difference
between the maximum and the minimum transmit power of an OFDM symbol for
a specified reference condition.

NOTE 2: The upper limit of the dynamic range at a *TAB connector* is the
OFDM symbol power at maximum output power (P~Rated,c,TABC~) when
transmitting on all RBs. The lower limit of the dynamic range at a *TAB
connector* is the OFDM symbol power when one resource block is
transmitted. The OFDM symbol carries PDSCH or sPDSCH (for sTTI) and not
contain RS, PBCH or synchronization signals.

For MSR operation the test for transmitter off power in clause 6.4.2
demonstrates compliance.

##### 6.4.3.4.2.2 UTRA TDD operation {#utra-tdd-operation-1 .H6}

The minimum requirement is applied to all *TAB connectors*, they may be
tested one at a time or multiple *TAB connectors* may be tested in
parallel as shown in clause D.1.1. Whichever method is used the
procedure is repeated until all *TAB connectors* necessary to
demonstrate conformance have been tested.

1\) Connect *TAB connector* to measurement equipment as shown in clause
D.1.1. All *TAB connectors* not under test shall be terminated.

2\) Set each *TAB connector* to output according to the applicable test
configuration in clause 5 using the corresponding test models or set of
physical channels in clause 4.12.2. For single carrier set the *TAB
connector* to transmit at manufacturers declared *rated carrier output
power per TAB connector* (P~Rated,c,TABC~).

3\) Measure the RRC filtered mean power of the *TAB connector* output
signal chipwise (i.e. averaged over time intervals of one chip duration)
over the transmit off power period starting 11 chips before the start of
the receive time slot TS i = UpPCH, and ending 8 chips before the next
transmit time slot TS i=4 starts.

procedure is repeated until all *TAB connectors* necessary to
demonstrate conformance have been tested.

1\) Connect *TAB connector* to measurement equipment as shown in clause
D.1.1. All *TAB connectors* not under test shall be terminated.

As a general rule, the resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment
should be equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to improve
measurement accuracy, sensitivity, efficiency and avoiding e.g. carrier
leakage, the resolution bandwidth may be smaller than the measurement
bandwidth. When the resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement
bandwidth, the result should be integrated over the measurement
bandwidth in order to obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the
measurement bandwidth.

test configuration in clause 5 using the corresponding test models or
set of physical channels in clause 4.12.2. For single carrier set the

output power per TAB connector* (P~Rated,c,TABC~).

3\) Measure the mean power spectral density over 70μs filtered with a
square filter of bandwidth equal to the RF bandwidth of the *TAB
connector* centred on the central frequency of the RF bandwidth. 70μs
average window centre is set from 35μs after end of one transmitter ON
period + 17 μs to 35 μs before start of next transmitter ON period - 17
μs.

4\) For a *TAB connector* supporting contiguous CA, measure the mean
power spectral density over 70 μs filtered with a square filter of
bandwidth equal to the Aggregated Channel Bandwidth BW~Channel\_CA~
centred on (F~edge\_high~+F~edge\_low~)/2. 70 μs average window centre
is set from 35 μs after end of one transmitter ON period + 17 μs to 35μs
before start of next transmitter ON period - 17 μs.

In addition, for *multi-band TAB connector(s)*, the following steps
shall apply:

6.6 Unwanted Emissions
----------------------

### 6.6.1 General

Unwanted emissions consist of so-called out-of-band emissions and
spurious emissions according to ITU definitions \[14\]. In ITU
terminology, out of band emissions are unwanted emissions immediately
outside the *channel bandwidth* resulting from the modulation process
and non-linearity in the transmitter but excluding spurious emissions.
Spurious emissions are emissions which are caused by unwanted
transmitter effects such as harmonics emission, parasitic emission,
intermodulation products and frequency conversion products, but exclude
out of band emissions.

For AAS BS in *single RAT E-UTRA operation* and *MSR operation*, the
out-of-band emissions requirement for the AAS BS transmitter is
specified in terms of an operating band unwanted emissions requirement
that defines limits for emissions in each supported *downlink operating
band* plus the frequency ranges Δf~OBUE~ above and Δf~OBUE~ below each
band, where Δf~OBUE~ is the maximum offset of the operating band
unwanted emission mask from the operating band edge. Emissions outside
of this frequency range are limited by a spurious emissions requirement.
For UTRA FDD single RAT AAS BS, the out of band emission requirement for
AAS BS transmitter is specified in terms of spectrum emission mask
requirement.

The values of Δf~OBUE~ are defined for *hybrid AAS BS* for E-UTRA and
UTRA operating bands in Table 6.6.1-1.

band*

is in general defined by the unwanted emission *basic limit* which is
the same as the corresponding applicable *Non-AAS BS* per transmitter
requirement specified in \[2\], \[3\], \[4\] or \[5\],and its scaling by
N~TXU,countedpercell.~ The unwanted emission requirements are applied
per the *TAB connector TX min cell groups* for all the configurations
supported by the AAS BS. The *basic limits* and corresponding scaling
are defined in each relevant clause.

There are in addition a requirement for occupied bandwidth and an ACLR
requirement.

### 6.6.2 Occupied bandwidth

#### 6.6.2.1 Definition and applicability

The occupied bandwidth is the width of a frequency band such that, below
the lower and above the upper frequency limits, the mean powers emitted
are each equal to a specified percentage β/2 of the total mean
transmitted power. See also Recommendation ITU-R SM.328 \[17\].

The value of β/2 shall be taken as 0.5%.

The occupied bandwidth requirement applies during the *transmitter ON
period* for a single transmitted carrier. The minimum requirement below
may be applied regionally. There may also be regional requirements to
declare the occupied bandwidth according to the definition in the
present clause.

#### 6.6.2.2 Minimum requirement

For MSR AAS BS, the minimum requirement for occupied bandwidth is the
same as that stated in TS 37.104 \[12\], clause 6.6.3.

For single RAT UTRA FDD AAS BS, the minimum requirement for occupied
bandwidth is the same as that stated in TS 25.104 \[9\], clause 6.6.1.

For single RAT UTRA TDD, 1,28Mcps option AAS BS, the minimum requirement
for occupied bandwidth is the same as that stated in TS 25.105 \[10\],
clause 6.6.1.

For single RAT E-UTRA AAS BS, the minimum requirement for occupied
bandwidth is the same as that stated in TS 36.104 \[11\], clause 6.6.1.

#### 6.6.2.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify that the emission of the *TAB connector*
does not occupy an excessive bandwidth for the service to be provided
and is, therefore, not likely to create interference to other users of
the spectrum beyond undue limits.

##### 6.6.2.4.1.4 E-UTRA and NR {#e-utra-and-nr-1 .H6}

Aggregated Channel Bandwidth positions to be tested for contiguous
carrier aggregation:

\- B~BW\ Channel\ CA~, M~BW\ Channel\ CA~ and T~BW\ Channel\ CA~; see
clause 4.12.1.

For a AAS BS declared to be capable of single carrier operation, start
transmission according to E- TM1.1 for E-UTRA or \[NR-FR1-TM 1.1\] for
NR, clause 4.12.2.

##### 6.6.2.4.2 Procedure

##### 6.6.2.4.2.1 General Procedure {#general-procedure-4 .H6}

The minimum requirement is applied to all *TAB connectors*, they may be
tested one at a time or multiple *TAB connectors* may be tested in
parallel as shown in clause D.1.1. Whichever method is used the
procedure is repeated until all *TAB connectors* necessary to
demonstrate conformance have been tested.

1\) Connect *TAB connector* to measurement equipment as shown in clause
D.1.1. All *TAB connectors* not under test shall be terminated.

2\) For UTRA and E-UTRA and NR declared capable of single carrier
operation set the *TAB connector* to transmit at manufacturers declared
rated carrier output power per *TAB connector* (P~Rated,c,TABC~).

For E-UTRA and NR declared capable of contiguous carrier aggregation
operation set the *TAB connector* to transmit on all carriers configured
using the applicable test configuration and corresponding power setting
specified in clause 5.

##### 6.6.2.4.2.2 UTRA FDD {#utra-fdd-11 .H6}

1\) Measure the spectrum of the transmitted signal across a span of 10
MHz, based on an occupied bandwidth requirement of 5 MHz. The selected
resolution bandwidth (RBW) filter of the analyser shall be 30 kHz or
less. The spectrum shall be measured at 400 or more points across the
measurement span.

NOTE: The detection mode of the spectrum analyzer will not have any
effect on the result if the statistical properties of the out-of-OBW
power are the same as those of the inside-OBW power. Both are expected
to have the Rayleigh distribution of the amplitude of Gaussian noise. In
any case where the statistics are not the same, though, the detection
mode is power responding. There are at least two ways to be power
responding. The spectrum analyser can be set to \"sample\" detection,
with its video bandwidth setting at least three times its RBW setting.
Or the analyser may be set to respond to the average of the power
(root-mean-square of the voltage) across the measurement cell.

2\) Compute the total of the power, P0, (in power units, not decibel
units) of all the measurement cells in the measurement span. Compute P1,
the power outside the occupied bandwidth on each side. P1 is half of the
total power outside the bandwidth. P1 is half of (100 % - (occupied
percentage)) of P0. For the occupied percentage of 99 %, P1 is 0.005
times P0.

3\) Determine the lowest frequency, f1, for which the sum of all power
in the measurement cells from the beginning of the span to f1 exceeds
P1.

4\) Determine the highest frequency, f2, for which the sum of all power
in the measurement cells from the end of the span to f2 exceeds P1.

5\) Compute the occupied bandwidth as f2 - f1.

In addition, for *multi-band TAB connector(s)*, the following steps
shall apply:

6\) For *multi-band TAB connectors* and single band tests, repeat the
steps above per involved band where single band test configurations and
test models shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

##### 6.6.2.4.2.3 UTRA TDD {#utra-tdd-8 .H6}

1\) Measure the power of the transmitted signal with a measurement
filter of bandwidth 30 kHz. The characteristic of the filter shall be
approximately Gaussian (typical spectrum analyser filter). The centre
frequency of the filter shall be stepped in contiguous 30 kHz steps from
a minimum frequency, which shall be (2,4 - 0,015) MHz below the assigned
channel frequency of the transmitted signal, up to a maximum frequency,
which shall be (2,4 ‑ 0,015) MHz above the assigned channel frequency of
the transmitted signal. The time duration of each step shall be
sufficiently long to capture one active time slot. The measured power
shall be recorded for each step.

2\) Determine the total output power by accumulating the recorded power
measurement results of all steps.

3\) Sum up the recorded power measurement results, starting from the
step at the minimum frequency defined in (3) up to the step at a lower
limit frequency by which this sum is equal to or greater than 0,5 % of
the total output power determined in (4). This limit frequency is
recorded as \"Lower Frequency\".

4\) Sum up the recorded power measurement results, starting from the
step at the maximum frequency defined in (3) down to the step at an
upper limit frequency by which this sum is equal to or greater than 0,5
% of the total output power determined in (4). This limit frequency is
recorded as \"Upper Frequency\".

5\) Calculate the occupied bandwidth as the difference between the
\"Upper Frequency\" obtained in (5) and the \"Lower Frequency\" obtained
in (6).

In addition, for *multi-band TAB connector(s)*, the following steps
shall apply:

6\) For *multi-band TAB connectors* and single band tests, repeat the
steps above per involved band where single band test configurations and
test models shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

##### 6.6.2.4.2.4 E-UTRA and NR {#e-utra-and-nr-2 .H6}

1\) Measure the spectrum emission of the transmitted signal using at
least the number of measurement points, and across a span, as listed in
table 6.6.2.4.2.4-1 for E-UTRA and 6.6.2.4.2.4-2 for NR. The selected
resolution bandwidth (RBW) filter of the analyser shall be 30 kHz or
less.

channel frequency to the sum of the filtered mean power measured on each
*TAB connector* in the *TAB connector TX min cell group* at the adjacent
channel frequency shall be greater than or equal to the AAS ACLR limit.
This applies for each *TAB connector TX min cell group*.

Or

2\) The ratio of the filtered mean power at the *TAB connector* centred
on the assigned channel frequency to the filtered mean power at each
*TAB connector* centred on the adjacent channel frequency shall be
greater than or equal to the AAS limit for every *TAB connector* in the

*TAB connector* alternative are that for each *TAB connector TX cell
group* and each applicable absolute *basic limit* as specified in this
clause, the emissions at each of the *TAB connectors* of the *TAB
connector TX cell* *group* shall not exceed the specified absolute
*basic limit* + 10log~10~(N~TXU,countedpercell~) - 10log~10~(n) where n

##### 6.6.3.5.3.1A NR test requirement {#a-nr-test-requirement .H6}

For NR, the test requirement is specified in tables 6.6.3.5.3.1A-1 and
applies outside the *Base Station RF Bandwidth* or *Maximum Radio
Bandwidth*.

For a *TAB connector* operating in non-contiguous spectrum, the ACLR
also applies for the first adjacent channel inside any sub-block gap
with a gap size as indicated in table 6.6.3.5.3.1A-2. The ACLR
requirement for the second adjacent channel applies inside any sub-block
gap with a gap size as indicated in table 6.6.3.5.3.1A-2. The CACLR test
requirement in clause 6.6.3.5.3.4 applies in sub block gaps for the
frequency ranges defined in table 6.6.3.5.3.4-2.

For a *multi-band TAB connector*, the ACLR also applies for the first
adjacent channel inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* with a gap size as
indicated in table 6.6.3.5.3.1A-2. The ACLR requirement for the second
adjacent channel applies inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* with a gap
size as indicated in table 6.6.3.5.3.1A-2. The CACLR test requirement in
clause 6.6.3.5.3.4 applies in sub block gaps for the frequency ranges
defined in table 6.6.3.5.3.4-2.

The requirement applies during the transmitter on period.

The ACLR is defined with a square filter of bandwidth equal to the
transmission bandwidth configuration of the transmitted signal
(BW~Config~) centred on the assigned channel frequency and a filter
centred on the adjacent channel frequency according to the tables below.

For operation in paired or unpaired spectrum, the ACLR shall be higher
than the value specified in table 6.6.3.5.3.1A-1.

##### 6.6.3.5.3.2 MSR UTRA FDD test requirement {#msr-utra-fdd-test-requirement .H6}

For UTRA FDD, the test requirement is specified in TS 25.141 \[18\],
clause 6.5.2.2.5, and applies outside the *Base Station RF Bandwidth* or
Maximum Radio Bandwidth.

For a *TAB connector* operating in non-contiguous spectrum, ACLR
requirement also applies for the first adjacent channel, inside any
sub-block gap with a gap size W~gap~ ≥ 15 MHz. The ACLR requirement for
the second adjacent channel applies inside any sub-block gap with a gap
size W~gap~ ≥ 20 MHz. The CACLR test requirement in clause 6.6.3.5.6.2
applies in sub block gaps for the frequency ranges defined in table
6.6.3.5.6.2-1.

For a *multi-band TAB connector* ACLR requirement also applies for the
first adjacent channel, inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* with a gap
size W~gap~ ≥ 15 MHz. The ACLR requirement for the second adjacent
channel applies inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* with a gap size
W~gap~ ≥ 20 MHz. The CACLR requirement in clause 6.6.3.5.6.2 applies in
*Inter RF Bandwidth gap*s for the frequency ranges defined in table
6.6.3.5.6.2-1.

##### 6.6.3.5.3.3 MSR UTRA TDD test requirement {#msr-utra-tdd-test-requirement .H6}

For UTRA TDD, the test requirement is specified in clause 6.6.3.5.5, and
applies outside the *Base Station RF Bandwidth* or Maximum Radio
Bandwidth.

##### 6.6.3.5.3.4 Cumulative ACLR requirement in non-contiguous spectrum {#cumulative-aclr-requirement-in-non-contiguous-spectrum .H6}

The following test requirement applies for sub-block or *Inter RF
Bandwidth gap* sizes listed in table 6.6.3.5.3.4-1 for UTRA FDD, UTRA
TDD or E-UTRA operation or table 6.6.3.5.3.4-1A for NR operation:

\- Inside a sub-block gap within an operating band for a BS operating in
non-contiguous spectrum.

\- Inside an *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* for a BS operating in multiple
bands, where multiple bands are mapped on the same antenna connector.

The Cumulative Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (CACLR) in a
sub-block gap or the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* is the ratio of:

a\) the sum of the filtered mean power centred on the assigned channel
frequencies for the two carriers adjacent to each side of the sub-block
gap or the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*; and

b\) the filtered mean power centred on a frequency channel adjacent to
one of the respective sub-block edges or *Base Station RF Bandwidth
edges*.

The requirement applies to adjacent channels of E-UTRA or UTRA or NR
carriers allocated adjacent to each side of the sub‑block gap or the
*Inter RF Bandwidth gap*. In case of mixed UTRA and E-UTRA (but not NR)
carriers on either side of the gap, table 6.6.3.5.3.4-1 is applicable.
In case of mixed NR and E-UTRA or UTRA or NR only carriers on either
side of the gap, table 6.6.3.5.3.4-1A is applicable. The assumed filter
for the adjacent channel frequency is defined in tables 6.6.3.5.3.4-1
and 6.6.3.5.3.4-1A and the filters on the assigned channels are defined
in table 6.6.3.5.3.4-2.

NOTE: If the RAT on the assigned channel frequencies is different, the
filters used are also different.

The CACLR for E-UTRA and UTRA carriers located on either side of the
sub-block gap or the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* shall be higher than the
value specified in table 6.6.3.5.3.4-1.

The following test requirement applies for a *TAB connector* operating
in non-contiguous spectrum or multiple bands.

The following requirement applies for the gap sizes listed in table
6.6.3.5.4.2-1:

\- inside a sub-block gap within an operating band for a *TAB connector*
operating in non-contiguous spectrum;

\- inside an *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* for a *multi-band TAB connector*.

The Cumulative Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (CACLR) in a
sub-block gap or *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* is the ratio of:

a\) the sum of the filtered mean power centred on the assigned channel
frequencies for the two carriers adjacent to each side of the sub-block
gap or *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*; and

b\) the filtered mean power centred on a frequency channel adjacent to
one of the respective sub-block edges or *Base Station RF Bandwidth
edges*.

The assumed filter for the adjacent channel frequency is defined in
table 6.6.3.5.4.2-1and the filters on the assigned channels are defined
in table 6.6.3.5.4.2-2.

The CACLR for UTRA carriers located on either side of the sub-block gap
or *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* shall be higher than the value specified in
table 6.6.3.5.4.2-1.

considered (single carrier, multi-carrier). It applies for all
transmission modes foreseen by the manufacturer\'s specification.

For a *multi-band TAB connector* the ACLR requirement also applies for
the first adjacent channel inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* with a
gap size W~gap~ ≥4.8MHz. The ACLR requirement for the second adjacent
channel applies inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* with a gap size
W~gap~ ≥6.4 MHz.

The same test requirements apply to 1,28 Mcps TDD option BS supporting
16QAM.

The following test requirement applies for the sub-block or *Inter RF
Bandwidth gap* sizes listed in table 6.6.3.5.6.2-1,

\- Inside a sub-block gap within an operating band for a BS operating in
non-contiguous spectrum.

\- Inside an *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* for a *multi-band TAB connector*.

The Cumulative Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (CACLR) in a
sub-block gap or *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* is the ratio of:

a\) the sum of the filtered mean power centred on the assigned channel
frequencies for the two carriers adjacent to each side of the sub-block
gap or *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*; and

b\) the filtered mean power centred on a frequency channel adjacent to
one of the respective sub-block edges or *Base Station RF Bandwidth
edges*.

The assumed filter for the adjacent channel frequency is defined in
tables 6.6.3.5.6.2-1 and 6.6.3.5.6.2-2. Filters on the assigned channels
are defined in table 6.6.3.5.6.2-3.

for E-UTRA carriers located on either side of the sub-block gap or
*Inter RF Bandwidth gap* shall be higher than the value specified in
tables 6.6.3.5.6.2-1 and 6.6.3.5.6.2-2.

##### 6.6.4.4.2 Procedure

##### 6.6.4.4.2.1 General procedure {#general-procedure-6 .H6}

The minimum requirement is applied to all *TAB connectors*, they may be
tested one at a time or multiple *TAB connectors* may be tested in
parallel as shown in clause D.1.1. Whichever method is used the
procedure is repeated until all *TAB connectors* necessary to
demonstrate conformance have been tested.

a\) Connect *TAB connector* to measurement equipment as shown in clause
D.1.1. All *TAB connectors* not under test shall be terminated.

As a general rule, the resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment
should be equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to improve
measurement accuracy, sensitivity, efficiency and avoiding e.g. carrier
leakage, the resolution bandwidth may be smaller than the measurement
bandwidth. When the resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement
bandwidth, the result should be integrated over the measurement
bandwidth in order to obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the
measurement bandwidth.

The measurement device characteristics shall be:

\- Measurements with an offset from the carrier centre frequency between
2,515 MHz and 4.0 MHz shall use a 30 kHz measurement bandwidth.

\- Measurements with an offset from the carrier centre frequency between
4.0 MHz and (f\_offsetmax - 500 kHz).shall use a 1 MHz measurement
bandwidth.

\- Detection mode: True RMS.

The emission power should be averaged over an appropriate time duration
to ensure the measurement is within the measurement uncertainty in Table
4.1.2.2-1.

b\) For single carrier operation set the *TAB connector* to transmit at
manufacturers declared rated carrier output power per *TAB connector*
(P~Rated,c,TABC~)

For a *TAB connector* declared to be capable of multi-carrier and/or CA
operation set the *TAB connector* to transmit on all carriers configured
using the applicable test configuration and corresponding power setting
specified in clause 5 using the corresponding test models or set of
physical channels in clause 4.12.

##### 6.6.4.4.2.1 UTRA FDD {#utra-fdd-17 .H6}

1\) Step the centre frequency of the measurement filter in contiguous
steps and measure the emission within the specified frequency ranges
with the specified measurement bandwidth. For *multi-band TAB connector*
or *TAB connector* operating in non-contiguous spectrum, the emission
within the Inter RF Bandwidth or sub-block gap shall be measured using
the specified measurement bandwidth from the closest *Base Station RF
Bandwidth* or sub block edge.

In addition, for *multi-band TAB connector(s)*, the following steps
shall apply:

2\) For *multi-band TAB connectors* and single band tests, repeat the
steps above per involved band where single band test configurations and
test models shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

##### 6.6.4.4.2.2 UTRA TDD {#utra-tdd-12 .H6}

1\) Measure the power of the *TAB connector* spectrum emissions by
applying measurement filters with bandwidths as specified in the
relevant table in clause 6.6.4.5.2.2. The characteristic of the filters
shall be approximately Gaussian (typical spectrum analyzer filters). The
centre frequency of the filter shall be stepped in contiguous steps over
the ranges of frequency offsets f\_offset as given in the tables. The
step width shall be equal to the respective measurement bandwidth. The
time duration of each step shall be sufficiently long to capture one
active time slot.

2\) The measurement shall be performed by applying filters with
measurement bandwidth of 50 kHz or less and integrating the measured
results over the nominal measurement bandwidth 1 MHz specified in the
tables in clause 6.6.4.5.2.2 when the measurement bandwidth is 1 MHz.

In addition, for *multi-band TAB connector(s)*, the following steps
shall apply:

3\) For *multi-band TAB connectors* and single band tests, repeat the
steps above per involved band where single band test configurations and
test models shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

The same procedure applies to *TAB connectors* declared to support
16QAM.

#### 6.6.4.5 Test requirements

##### 6.6.4.5.1 General

Conformance may be shown to either the measure and sum test requirement
or the per *TAB connector* test requirement.

1\) The spurious emission test requirements for an AAS BS when using the
measure and sum alternative are that for each *TAB connector TX cell
group* and each applicable *basic limit* as specified in this clause,
the power summation of emissions at the *TAB connectors* of the *TAB
connector TX cell* *group* shall not exceed a limit specified as the
*basic limit* + 10log~10~(N~TXU,countedpercell~).

2\) The spurious emission test requirements for an AAS BS when using the
per *TAB connector* alternative are that for each *TAB connector TX cell
group* and each applicable *basic limit* as specified in this clause,
the emissions at each of the *TAB connectors* of the *TAB connector TX
cell* *group* shall not exceed a limit specified as the *basic limit* +
10log~10~(N~TXU,countedpercell~) - 10log(n) where n is the number of
*TAB connectors* in the *TAB connector TX cell group*.

The appropriate table for the basic limit is based on the same power
level (P~Rated,c,sys~) as used for the AAS BS rated power limits for BS
classes in table 6.2.2.1-1 the same method of scaling the power level
using N~TXU,counted~ is used.

##### 6.6.4.5.2 Basic Limits

##### 6.6.4.5.2.1 UTRA FDD {#utra-fdd-18 .H6}

The *basic limit* is specified in tables 6.6.4.5.2.1-1 to 6.6.4.5.2.1-11
for the appropriate P~Rated,c,sys~, where:

\- ∆f is the separation between the carrier frequency and the nominal
-3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to the carrier frequency.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the carrier frequency and the
centre of the measurement filter;

\- f\_offset~max~ is either 12.5 MHz or the offset to the UMTS Tx band
edge as defined in clause 3.4.1, whichever is the greater.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

Inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* s with Wgap \< 2×Δf~OBUE~ MHz for BS
operating in multiple bands, emissions shall not exceed the cumulative
sum of the test requirements specified at the *Base Station RF Bandwidth
edges* on each side of the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*. The *basic limit*
for *Base Station RF Bandwidth edge* is specified in tables
6.6.4.5.2.1-1 to 6.6.4.5.2.1-11 below, where in this case:

\- ∆f is equal to 2.5 MHz plus the separation between the *Base Station
RF Bandwidth edge* frequency and the nominal -3dB point of the measuring
filter closest to the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edge*.

\- f\_offset is equal to 2.5 MHz plus the separation between the *Base
Station RF Bandwidth edge* frequency and the centre of the measuring
filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is either 12.5 MHz or the offset to the UMTS Tx band
edge as defined in clause 5.2, whichever is the greater.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

For a *multi-band TAB connector*, the operating band unwanted emission
limits apply also in a supported operating band without any carrier
transmitted, in the case where there are carrier(s) transmitted in
another supported operating band. In this case, no cumulative limit is
applied in the *inter-band gap* between a supported downlink operating
band with carrier(s) transmitted and a supported downlink operating band
without any carrier transmitted and

\- In case the *inter-band gap* between a downlink band with carrier(s)
transmitted and a downlink band without any carrier transmitted is less
than 2×Δf~OBUE~ MHz, f\_offset~max~ shall be the offset to the frequency
10 MHz outside the outermost edges of the two downlink operating bands
and the operating band unwanted emission limit of the band where there
are carriers transmitted, as defined in the tables of the present
clause, shall apply across both downlink bands.

\- In other cases, the operating band unwanted emission limit of the
band where there are carriers transmitted, as defined in the tables of
the present clause for the largest frequency offset (∆f~max~), shall
apply from Δf~OBUE~ MHz below the lowest frequency, up to Δf~OBUE~ MHz
above the highest frequency of the downlink operating band without any
carrier transmitted.

Inside any sub-block gap for a *TAB connector* operating in
non-contiguous spectrum, the measurement results shall not exceed the
cumulative sum of the test requirements specified for the adjacent sub
blocks on each side of the sub block gap. The *basic limit* for each sub
block is specified in tables 6.6.4.5.2.1-1 to 6.6.4.5.2.1-11 below,
where in this case:

\- ∆f is equal to 2.5 MHz plus the separation between the sub block edge
frequency and the nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to
the sub block edge.

\- f\_offset is equal to 2.5 MHz plus the separation between the sub
block edge frequency and the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is equal to the sub block gap bandwidth minus half of
the bandwidth of the measuring filter plus 2.5 MHz.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

The basic limits for a TAB connector declared capable of 16QAM are the
same as those defined in the clause.

### 6.6.5 Operating band unwanted emission

#### 6.6.5.1 Definition and applicability

Unless otherwise stated, for E-UTRA single band and MSR the operating
band unwanted emission limits are defined from Δf~OBUE~ below the lowest
frequency of each supported *downlink operating band* to the lower *Base
Station RF Bandwidth edge* located at F~BW\ RF,low~ and from the upper
*Base Station RF Bandwidth edge* located at F~BW\ RF,high~ up to
Δf~OBUE~ above the highest frequency of each supported *downlink
operating band*. The values of Δf~OBUE~ are defined in table 6.6.1-1.

For AAS BS capable of operation in multiple operating bands, using
*single band TAB connector*s, the single-band requirements apply to
those connectors and the cumulative evaluation of the emission limit in
the *inter RF bandwidth gap* is not applicable.

The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered
and for all transmission modes foreseen by the manufacturer\'s
specification.

For BS operating in bands n50, n51, n74, n75 and n76 additional emission
limits that might be applicable outside OBUE frequency domain are
specified in clause 6.6.5.5.4.6.

#### 6.6.5.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement for MSR operation are defined in
TS 37.105 \[8\], clause 6.6.5.2.

There is no Operating band unwanted emission requirement for UTRA
operation.

The minimum requirement for E-UTRA operation is in TS 37.105 \[8\],
clause 6.6.5.4.

#### 6.6.5.3 Test purpose

This test measures the emissions of the *TAB connector*, close to the
assigned channel bandwidth of the wanted signal, while the transmitter
is in operation.

#### 6.6.5.4 Method of test

##### 6.6.5.4.1 Initial conditions

##### 6.6.5.4.1.1 General test conditions {#general-test-conditions-7 .H6}

Test environment:

\- normal; see clause B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier:

\- B, M and T; see clause 4.12.1.

*Base Station RF Bandwidth* positions to be tested for multi-carrier:

\- B~RFBW~, M~RFBW~ and T~RFBW~ in single-band operation; see
clause 4.12.1; B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ in multi-band
operation, see clause 4.12.1.

##### 6.6.5.4.1.2 UTRA FDD {#utra-fdd-19 .H6}

##### 6.6.5.4.1.3 E-UTRA and NR {#e-utra-and-nr-3 .H6}

##### 6.6.5.4.2 Procedure

The minimum requirement is applied to all *TAB connectors*, they may be
tested one at a time or multiple *TAB connectors* may be tested in
parallel as shown in clause D.1.1. Whichever method is used the
procedure is repeated until all *TAB connectors* necessary to
demonstrate conformance have been tested.

1\) Connect *TAB connector* to measurement equipment as shown in clause
D.1.1. All *TAB connectors* not under test shall be terminated.

As a general rule, the resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment
should be equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to improve
measurement accuracy, sensitivity, efficiency and avoiding e.g. carrier
leakage, the resolution bandwidth may be smaller than the measurement
bandwidth. When the resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement
bandwidth, the result should be integrated over the measurement
bandwidth in order to obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the
measurement bandwidth.

The measurement device characteristics shall be:

\- Detection mode: True RMS.

The emission power should be averaged over an appropriate time duration
to ensure the measurement is within the measurement uncertainty in Table
4.1.2.2-1.

2\) Set the set the *TAB connector* to transmit:

a\) For MSR:

\- Set the *TAB connector* to transmit maximum power according to the
applicable test configuration in clause 5 using the corresponding test
models or set of physical channels in clause 4.12.

b\) For E-UTRA:

*- TAB connector* declared to be capable of single carrier operation
only, set the *TAB connector* to transmit a signal according to E-TM1.1
(clause 4.12.2) at manufacturer\'s declared rated output power
P~rated,c,TABC~..

\- For a *TAB connector* declared to be capable of multi-carrier and/or
CA operation, set the set the *TAB connector* to transmit according to
E-TM1.1 on all carriers configured using the applicable test
configuration and corresponding power setting specified in clause 4.11.

3\) Step the centre frequency of the measurement filter in contiguous
steps and measure the emission within the specified frequency ranges
with the specified measurement bandwidth.

4\) Repeat the test for the remaining test cases:

a\) For MSR with channel set-up according to clause 5 and clause 4.12.2.

b\) For E-UTRA with the channel set-up according to E-TM 1.2

In addition, for *multi-band TAB connector(s)*, the following steps
shall apply:

5\) For *multi-band TAB connectors* and single band tests, repeat the
steps above per involved band where single band test configurations and
test models shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

#### 6.6.5.5 Test requirements

##### 6.6.5.5.1 General

Conformance may be shown to either the measure and sum test requirement
or the per *TAB connector* test requirement.

1\) The spurious emission test requirements for an AAS BS when using the
measure and sum alternative are that for each *TAB connector TX cell
group* and each applicable *basic limit* as specified in this clause,
the power summation of emissions at the *TAB connectors* of the *TAB
connector TX cell* *group* shall not exceed a limit specified as the
*basic limit* + 10log~10~(N~TXU,countedpercell~).

2\) The spurious emission test requirements for an AAS BS when using the
per *TAB connector* alternative are that for each *TAB connector TX cell
group* and each applicable *basic limit* as specified in this clause,
the emissions at each of the *TAB connectors* of the *TAB connector TX
cell* *group* shall not exceed a limit specified as the *basic limit* +
10log~10~(N~TXU,countedpercell~) - 10log(n) where n is the number of
*TAB connectors* in the *TAB connector TX cell group*.

The appropriate table for the basic limit is based on the same power
level (P~Rated,c,sys~) as used for the AAS BS rated power limits for BS
classes in table 6.2.2.1-1 the same method of scaling the power level
using N~TXU,counted~ is used.

As a general rule, the resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment
should be equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to improve
measurement accuracy, sensitivity and efficiency, the resolution
bandwidth can be smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When the
resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the
result should be integrated over the measurement bandwidth in order to
obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.

##### 6.6.5.5.2 Basic Limits for MSR Band Categories 1 and 3

For an AAS BS of Wide Area BS class operating in Band Category 1 or Band
Category 3, the requirement applies outside the *Base Station RF
Bandwidth edges*. In addition, for a Wide Area BS operating in
non-contiguous spectrum, it applies inside any sub-block gap. In
addition, for an AAS BS of Wide Area BS class operating in multiple
bands, it applies inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*.

For an AAS BS of Medium Range BS class operating in Band Category 1 the
requirement applies outside the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edges*. In
addition, for a Medium Range BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum, it
applies inside any sub-block gap. In addition, for an AAS BS of Medium
Range BS class operating in multiple bands, it applies inside any *Inter
RF Bandwidth gap*.

For an AAS BS of Local Area BS class operating in Band Category 1 the
requirement applies outside the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edges*. In
addition, for a Local Area BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum, it
applies inside any sub-block gap. In addition, for an AAS BS of Local
Area BS class operating in multiple bands, it applies inside any *Inter
RF Bandwidth gap*.

Outside the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edges*, emissions *basic limits*
are specified in tables 6.6.2.5.1-1 to 6.6.2.5.1-4 below, where:

\- ∆f is the separation between the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edge*
frequency and the nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to
the carrier frequency.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the *Base Station RF Bandwidth
edge* frequency and the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is the offset to the frequency Δf~OBUE~ outside the
downlink operating band.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

For a *multi-band TAB connector*, inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*s
with W~gap~ \< 2\* Δf~OBUE~, a combined *basic* limit shall be applied
which is the cumulative sum of the test requirements specified at the
*Base Station RF Bandwidth edges* on each side of the *Inter RF
Bandwidth gap*. The *basic limit* for *Base Station RF Bandwidth edge*
is specified in tables 6.6.5.5.2-1 to 6.6.5.5.2-8, where in this case:

\- ∆f is the separation between the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edge*
frequency and the nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to
the carrier frequency.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the *Base Station RF Bandwidth
edge* frequency and the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is equal to the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* divided by
two.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offsetmax minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

For a *multi-band TAB connector*, the operating band unwanted emission
limits apply also in a supported operating band without any carriers
transmitted, in the case where there are carriers transmitted in another
operating band. In this case where there is no carrier transmitted in an
operating band, no cumulative *basic limits* are applied in the
*inter-band gap* between a supported downlink band with carrier(s)
transmitted and a supported downlink band without any carrier
transmitted and

\- In case the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* between a supported downlink
band with carrier(s) transmitted and a supported downlink band without
any carrier transmitted is less than 2\*Δf~OBUE~ MHz, f\_offset~max~
shall be the offset to the frequency Δf~OBUE~ outside the outermost
edges of the two supported downlink operating bands and the operating
band unwanted emission limit of the band where there are carriers
transmitted, as defined in the tables of the present clause, shall apply
across both supported downlink bands.

\- In other cases, the operating band unwanted emission limit of the
band where there are carriers transmitted, as defined in the tables of
the present clause for the largest frequency offset (∆f~max~), shall
apply from Δf~OBUE~ below the lowest frequency, up to Δf~OBUE~ above the
highest frequency of the supported downlink operating band without any
carrier transmitted.

Inside any sub-block gap for a *TAB connector* operating in
non-contiguous spectrum, a combined *basic limit* shall be applied which
is the cumulative sum of the test requirements specified for the
adjacent sub blocks on each side of the sub block gap. The *basic limit*
for each sub block is specified in tables 6.6.5.5.2-1 to 6.6.5.5.2-8,
where in this case:

\- ∆f is the separation between the sub block edge frequency and the
nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to the sub block
edge frequency.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the sub block edge frequency and
the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is equal to the sub block gap bandwidth divided by
two.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

Applicability of Wide Area operating band unwanted emission requirements
in tables 6.6.5.5.2-1/2, 6.6.5.5.2-2a and 6.5.5.2-2b is specified in
table 6.6.5.5.2-0.

Note: Option 1 and Option 2 correspond to the Category B option 1/2
operating band unwanted emissions defined in the E-UTRA and NR
specifications TS 36.104 \[4\] and TS 38.104 \[36\]. Option 2 also
corresponds to the UTRA spectrum emission mask as defined in TS 25.104
\[2\].

##### 6.6.5.5.3 Basic Limits for MSR Band Category 2

For a *TAB connector* operating in Band Category 2 the requirement
applies outside the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edges*. In addition, for
a *TAB connector* operating in non-contiguous spectrum, it applies
inside any sub-block gap.

Outside the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edges*, *basic limits* are
specified in tables 6.6.5.5.3-1 to 6.6.5.5.3-8, where:

\- ∆f is the separation between the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edge*
frequency and the nominal -3dB point of the measuring filter closest to
the carrier frequency.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the *Base Station RF Bandwidth
edge* frequency and the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is the offset to the frequency Δf~OBUE~ MHz outside
the downlink operating band.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

For a *multi-band TAB connector*, inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*s
with W~gap~ \< 2×Δf~OBUE~ MHz, a combined *basic* limit shall be applied
which is the cumulative sum of the test requirements specified at the
*Base Station RF Bandwidth edges* on each side of the *Inter RF
Bandwidth gap*. The *basic limit* for *Base Station RF Bandwidth edge*
is specified in tables 6.6.5.5.3-1 to 6.6.5.5.3-8, where in this case:

\- ∆f is the separation between the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edge*
frequency and the nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to
the carrier frequency.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the *Base Station RF Bandwidth
edge* frequency and the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is equal to the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* divided by
two.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offsetmax minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

For a *multi-band TAB connector* and where there is no carrier
transmitted in an operating band, no cumulative *basic limits* are
applied in the *inter-band gap* between a supported downlink band with
carrier(s) transmitted and a supported downlink band without any carrier
transmitted and

\- In case the *inter-band gap* between a supported downlink band with
carrier(s) transmitted and a supported downlink band without any carrier
transmitted less than is 2×Δf~OBUE~ MHz, f\_offset~max~ shall be the
offset to the frequency Δf~OBUE~ MHz outside the outermost edges of the
two supported downlink operating bands and the operating band unwanted
emission limit of the band where there are carriers transmitted, as
defined in the tables of the present clause, shall apply across both
supported downlink bands.

\- In other cases, the operating band unwanted emission limit of the
band where there are carriers transmitted, as defined in the tables of
the present clause for the largest frequency offset (∆f~max~), shall
apply from Δf~OBUE~ MHz below the lowest frequency, up to Δf~OBUE~ MHz
above the highest frequency of the supported downlink operating band
without any carrier transmitted.

Inside any sub-block gap for a *TAB connector* operating in
non-contiguous spectrum, a combined *basic* limit shall be applied which
is the cumulative sum of the test requirement specified for the adjacent
sub blocks on each side of the sub block gap. The *basic limit* for each
sub block is specified in tables 6.6.5.5.3-1 to 6.6.5.5.3-8, where in
this case:

\- ∆f is the separation between the sub block edge frequency and the
nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to the sub block
edge.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the sub block edge frequency and
the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is equal to the sub block gap bandwidth divided by
two.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

Applicability of Wide Area operating band unwanted emission requirements
in tables 6.6.5.5.3-1, 6.6.5.5.3-1a and 6.6.5.5.3-1b is specified in
table 6.6.5.5.3-0.

Note: Option 1 and option 2 correspond to the Category B option 1/2
operating band unwanted emissions defined in the E-UTRA and NR
specifications TS 36.104 \[4\] and TS 38.104 \[36\]. Option 2 also
corresponds to the UTRA spectrum emission mask as defined in TS 25.104
\[2\].

##### 6.6.5.5.4 Basic Limits for MSR Additional requirements

##### 6.6.5.5.4.1 Limits in FCC Title 47 {#limits-in-fcc-title-47 .H6}

In addition to the requirements in clauses 6.6.5.5.2 and 6.6.5.5.3, the
*TAB connector* may have to comply with the applicable *basic limits*
established by FCC Title 47 \[24\], when deployed in regions where those
limits are applied, and under the conditions declared by the
manufacturer.

##### 6.6.5.5.4.2 Unsynchronized operation for BC3 {#unsynchronized-operation-for-bc3 .H6}

In certain regions, the following requirements may apply to a TDD *TAB
connector* operating in BC3 in the same geographic area and in the same
operating band as another TDD system without synchronisation. For this
case the emissions *basic limit* is -52 dBm/MHz in each supported
downlink operating band except in:

\- The frequency range from 10 MHz below the lower *Base Station RF
Bandwidth edge* to the frequency 10 MHz above the upper *Base Station RF
Bandwidth edge* of each supported band.

NOTE 1: Local or regional regulations may specify another excluded
frequency range, which may include frequencies where synchronised TDD
systems operate.

NOTE 2: TDD Base Stations that are synchronized and operating in BC3 can
transmit without these additional co-existence requirements.

##### 6.6.5.5.4.3 Protection of DTT {#protection-of-dtt .H6}

In certain regions the following requirement may apply for protection of
DTT. For a *TAB connector* operating in Band 20/n20, the level of
emissions in the band 470-790 MHz, measured in an 8 MHz filter bandwidth
on centre frequencies F~filter~ according to table 6.6.5.5.4.3-1, a
*basic limit* P~EM,N~ is declared by the manufacturer. This requirement
applies in the frequency range 470-790 MHz even though part of the range
falls in the spurious domain.

##### 6.6.5.5.5 Basic Limits for E-UTRA

##### 6.6.5.5.5.1 General {#general-25 .H6}

The measurement results in clause 6.6.5.4 shall not exceed the maximum
levels based on the *basic limits* in the tables below, where:

\- ∆f is the separation between the channel edge frequency and the
nominal -3dB point of the measuring filter closest to the carrier
frequency.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the channel edge frequency and
the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is the offset to the frequency Δf~OBUE~ MHz outside
the downlink operating band.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

For a *multi-band TAB connector*, inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*s
with W~gap~ \< 2×Δf~OBUE~ MHz, a combined *basic* limit shall be applied
which is the cumulative sum of the test requirements specified at the
*Base Station RF Bandwidth edges* on each side of the *Inter RF
Bandwidth gap*. The *basic limit* for *Base Station RF Bandwidth edge*
is specified in tables 6.6.5.5.5.2-1 to 6.6.5.5.5.2‑9, where in this
case:

\- ∆f is the separation between the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edge*
frequency and the nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to
the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edge*.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the *Base Station RF Bandwidth
edge* frequency and the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is equal to the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* minus half of
the bandwidth of the measuring filter.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

For *multi-band TAB connector*, the operating band unwanted emission
limits apply also in a supported operating band without any carrier
transmitted, in the case where there are carrier(s) transmitted in
another supported operating band. In this case, no cumulative *basic
limit* is applied in the *inter-band gap* between a supported downlink
operating band with carrier(s) transmitted and a supported downlink
operating band without any carrier transmitted and:

\- In case the *inter-band gap* between a supported downlink operating
band with carrier(s) transmitted and a supported downlink operating band
without any carrier transmitted is less than 2×Δf~OBUE~ MHz,
f\_offset~max~ shall be the offset to the frequency Δf~OBUE~ MHz outside
the outermost edges of the two supported downlink operating bands and
the operating band unwanted emission limit of the band where there are
carriers transmitted, as defined in the tables of the present clause,
shall apply across both downlink bands.

\- In other cases, the operating band unwanted emission limit of the
band where there are carriers transmitted, as defined in the tables of
the present clause for the largest frequency offset (∆f~max~), shall
apply from Δf~OBUE~ MHz below the lowest frequency, up to Δf~OBUE~ MHz
above the highest frequency of the supported downlink operating band
without any carrier transmitted.

For a multicarrier E-UTRA TAB connector or a *TAB connector* configured
for intra-band contiguous or non-contiguous carrier aggregation the
definitions above apply to the lower edge of the carrier transmitted at
the lowest carrier frequency and the upper edge of the carrier
transmitted at the highest carrier frequency within a specified
frequency band.

In addition inside any sub-block gap for a *TAB connector* operating in
non-contiguous spectrum, measurement results shall not exceed a level
based on a combined *basic* limit shall be applied which is the
cumulative sum specified for the adjacent sub blocks on each side of the
sub block gap. The *basic limit* for each sub block is specified in
tables 6.6.5.5.5.2-1 to 6.6.5.5.5.2-9, where in this case:

\- ∆f is the separation between the sub block edge frequency and the
nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to the sub block
edge.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the sub block edge frequency and
the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is equal to the sub block gap bandwidth minus half of
the bandwidth of the measuring filter.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

##### 6.6.5.5.5.4 Basic limits for Wide Area BS Category B (Option 2) {#basic-limits-for-wide-area-bs-category-b-option-2 .H6}

For Category B Operating band unwanted emissions, there are two options
for the limits that may be applied regionally, option 2 is as follows.

The limits in this clause are intended for Europe and may be applied
regionally for a *TAB connector* operating in band 1, 3, 8, 32, 33, 34
or 65.

For a *TAB connector* operating in band 1, 3, 8, 32, 33, 34 or 65,
*basic limits* are specified in table 6.6.5.5.5.4-1 below for 5, 10, 15
and 20 MHz channel bandwidth.

declared by the manufacturer. This requirement applies in the frequency
range 470-790 MHz even though part of the range falls in the spurious
domain.

NOTE 1: The regional requirement is defined in terms of EIRP, which is
dependent on both the BS emissions at the *TAB connector* and the RND
and antenna array. The EIRP level is calculated using: P~EIRP~ = P~E~ +
G~ant~ where P~E~ denotes the *TAB connector* unwanted emission level at
the *TAB connector*, G~ant~ equals the RDN and antenna array gain. The
requirement defined above provides the characteristics of the base
station needed to verify compliance with the regional requirement.
Compliance with the regional requirement can be determined using the
method outlined in annex G of TS 36.104 \[11\].

In regions where FCC regulation applies, requirements for protection of
GPS according to FCC Order DA 20-48applies for operation in Band 24. The
following normative requirement covers the base station, to be used
together with other information about the site installation to verify
compliance with the requirement in FCC Order DA 20-48. The requirement

### 6.6.6 Spurious emission

#### 6.6.6.1 Definition and applicability

The conducted transmitter spurious emission limits apply from 9 kHz to
12.75 GHz, excluding the following RAT-specific frequency ranges:

\- UTRA TDD BS, 1.28 Mcps option as specified in TS 25.105 \[3\]: from 4
MHz below the lowest frequency of each operating band to 4 MHz above the
highest frequency of each operating band.

\- UTRA FDD BS as specified in TS 25.104 \[2\]: from 12.5MHz below the
lowest carrier frequency used up to 12.5MHz above the highest carrier
frequency used.

\- E-UTRA BS as specified in TS 36.104 \[4\]: from Δf~OBUE~ below the
lowest frequency of the *downlink operating band* up to Δf~OBUE~ above
the highest frequency of the *downlink operating band*, where Δf~OBUE~
is defined clause 6.6.1.

\- MSR BS as specified in TS 37.104 \[5\]: from Δf~OBUE~ below the
lowest frequency of the *downlink operating band* up to Δf~OBUE~ above
the highest frequency of the *downlink operating band*, where Δf~OBUE~
is defined clause 6.6.1.

For some operating bands the upper frequency limit is higher than
12.75 GHz in order to comply with the 5^th^ harmonic limit of the
*downlink operating band*, as specified in ITU-R recommendation
SM.329 \[14\]. In some exceptional cases, requirements apply also closer
than Δf~OBUE~ MHz from the *downlink operating band*; these cases are
highlighted in the requirement tables in respective referenced UTRA,
E-UTRA or MSR specifications. For operating bands supported by
*multi-band TAB connectors* exclusion bands apply to each supported
band.

The requirements applies for both single band and multiband *TAB
connectors* (except for frequencies at which exclusion bands or other
multi-band provisions apply) and for all transmission modes foreseen by
the manufacturer\'s specification. Unless otherwise stated, all
requirements are measured as mean power.

For operation in region 2, where the FCC guidance for MIMO systems
in \[38\] is applicable, N~TXU,countedpercell~ shall be equal to 1 for
the purposes of calculating the spurious emissions limits in clauses
6.6.6. For all other unwanted emissions requirements,
N~TXU,countedpercell~ shall be the value calculated according to
clause 6.1, unless stated differently in regional regulation.

The AAS BS test requirements for co-location spurious emissions limits
which are specified for Band 46 in TS 37.104 \[5\], are applicable for
AAS BS.

For BS operating in bands n50, n51, n74, n75 and n76 additional emission
limits that might be applicable in the spurious emissions frequency
domain are specified in clause 6.6.5.5.4.6.

#### 6.6.6.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement for MSR operation are defined in
TS 37.105 \[8\], clause 6.6.6.2.

The minimum requirement for UTRA operation are defined in
TS 37.105 \[8\], clause 6.6.6.3.

The minimum requirement for E-UTRA operation are defined in
TS 37.105 \[8\], clause 6.6.6.4.

#### 6.6.2.3 Test purpose

This test measures conducted spurious emission from the AAS BS transmit
*TAB connector(s)*, while the transmitter unit associated with the *TAB
connector* under test is in operation.

#### 6.6.6.4 Method of test

##### 6.6.6.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment:

\- normal; see clause B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier:

\- B when testing the spurious frequencies below F~DL\_low~ - Δf~OBUE~,

\- T when testing the spurioue frequencies above F~DL\_high~ + Δf~OBUE~;
see clause 4.12.1.

*Base Station RF Bandwidth* positions to be tested for multi-carrier:

\- B~RFBW~ when testing the spurious frequencies below F~DL\_low~ -
Δf~OBUE~;

Δf~OBUE~ in single-band operation; see clause 4.12.1;

\- B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ when testing the spurious frequencies below
F~DL\_low~ - Δf~OBUE~ of the lowest operating band; B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~
when testing the spurious frequencies below F~DL\_low~ - Δf~OBUE~ of the
lowest operating band in multi-band operation, see clause 4.12.1.

##### 6.6.6.4.2 Procedure

The minimum requirement is applied to all *TAB connectors*, they may be
tested one at a time or multiple *TAB connectors* may be tested in
parallel as shown in clause D.1.3. Whichever method is used the
procedure is repeated until all *TAB connectors* necessary to
demonstrate conformance have been tested.

1\) Connect *TAB connector* to measurement equipment as shown in clause
D.1.3. All *TAB connectors* not under test shall be terminated.

2\) Measurements shall use a measurement bandwidth in accordance to the
conditions in clause 6.6.6.5.

3\) The measurement device characteristics shall be:

\- Detection mode: True RMS.

The emission power should be averaged over an appropriate time duration
to ensure the measurement is within the measurement uncertainty in Table
4.1.2.2-1.

4\) Set the *TAB connector* to transmit:

a\) For MSR:

\- Set the *TAB connector* to transmit maximum power according to the
applicable test configuration in clause 5 using the corresponding test
models or set of physical channels in clause 4.11.

b\) For UTRA:

\- For a *TAB connector* declared to be capable of single carrier
operation only, set the *TAB connector* to transmit a signal according
to TM1, clause 4.12.2, at the manufacturer\'s declared rated output
power, P~rated,c,TABC~.

\- For a *TAB connector* declared to be capable of multi-carrier
operation, set the set the *TAB connector* to transmit according to TM1
on all carriers configured using the applicable test configuration and
corresponding power setting specified in clause 4.11.

c\) For E-UTRA:

*- TAB connector* declared to be capable of single carrier operation
only, set the *TAB connector* to transmit a signal according to E-TM1.1
in clause 4.12.2, at manufacturer\'s declared rated output power
P~rated,c,TABC~.

\- For a *TAB connector* declared to be capable of multi-carrier and/or
CA operation, set the set the *TAB connector* to transmit according to
E-TM1.1 on all carriers configured using the applicable test
configuration and corresponding power setting specified in clause 4.11.

5\) Measure the emission at the specified frequencies with specified
measurement bandwidth and note that the measured value does not exceed
the test requirement in clause 6.6.6.5.

In addition, for *multi-band TAB connector(s)*, the following steps
shall apply:

6\) For *multi-band TAB connectors* and single band tests, repeat the
steps above per involved band where single band test configurations and
test models shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

#### 6.6.6.5 Test requirements

##### 6.6.6.5.1 General

Conformance may be shown to either the measure and sum test requirement
or the per *TAB connector* test requirement:

1\) The spurious emission test requirements for an AAS BS when using the
measure and sum alternative are that for each *TAB connector TX cell
group* and each applicable *basic limit* as specified in this clause,
the power summation of emissions at the *TAB connectors* of the *TAB
connector TX cell* *group* shall not exceed a limit specified as the
*basic limit* + X, where X = 10log~10~(N~TXU,countedpercell~) , unless
stated differently in regional regulation.

2\) The spurious emission test requirements for an AAS BS when using the
per *TAB connector* alternative are that for each *TAB connector TX cell
group* and each applicable *basic limit* as specified in this clause,
the emissions at each of the *TAB connectors* of the *TAB connector TX
cell* *group* shall not exceed a limit specified as the *basic limit* +
X - 10log(n) where n is the number of *TAB connectors* in the *TAB
connector TX cell group* and X = 10log~10~(N~TXU,countedpercell~),
unless stated differently in regional regulation.

The appropriate table for the basic limit is based on the same power
level (P~Rated,c,sys~) as used for the AAS BS rated power limits for BS
classes in table 6.2.2.1-1 the same method of scaling the power level
using N~TXU,counted~ is used.

##### 6.6.6.5.2 Basic limits

##### 6.6.6.5.2.1 General {#general-27 .H6}

The basic limits specified in tables 6.6.6.5.2.2-1 to table
6.6.6.5.2.6-3 are applicable for the *TAB connector* under test.

##### 6.6.6.5.2.4 Protection of the BS receiver of own or different BS {#protection-of-the-bs-receiver-of-own-or-different-bs .H6}

This requirement shall be applied for FDD operation in order to prevent
the receivers of Base Stations being desensitised by emissions from the
transmitter *TAB connector*. It is measured at the transmit *TAB
connector* for any type of *TAB connector* which has common or separate
Tx/Rx antenna ports.

The basic limit of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits in
table 6.6.6.5.2.4 -1, depending on the declared Base Station class and
Band Category.

##### 6.6.6.5.2.5 Co-existence with other systems in the same geographical area {#co-existence-with-other-systems-in-the-same-geographical-area .H6}

These requirements may be applied for the protection of system operating
in frequency ranges other than the *TAB connector* downlink operating
band. The limits may apply as an optional protection of such systems
that are deployed in the same geographical area as the AAS BS, or they
may be set by local or regional regulation as a mandatory requirement
for an operating band. It is in some cases not stated in the present
document whether a requirement is mandatory or under what exact
circumstances that a limit applies, since this is set by local or
regional regulation. An overview of regional requirements in the present
document is given in clause 4.4.

Some requirements may apply for the protection of specific equipment
(UE, MS and/or BS) or equipment operating in specific systems (GSM/EDGE,
CDMA, UTRA, E-UTRA, NR, etc.) as listed below. The basic limit any
spurious emission are in table 6.6.6.5.2.5-1 for *TAB connector(s)*
where requirements for co-existence with the system listed in the first
column apply. For *multi-band TAB connector(s)*, the exclusions and
conditions in the Note column of table 6.6.6.5.2.5-1 apply for each
supported operating band.

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause,
except for the cases where the noted requirements apply to a BS
operating in Band 25/n25, Band 27, Band 28/n28 or Band 29, the
co-existence requirements in Table 6.6.6.5.2.5-1 do not apply for the 10
MHz frequency range immediately outside the downlink operating band (see
Tables 4.5-1 and 4.5-2). Emission limits for this excluded frequency
range may be covered by local or regional requirements.

NOTE 2: Table 6.6.6.5.2.5-1 assumes that two operating bands, where the
frequency ranges in table 4.4-1 or table 4.4‑2 would be overlapping, are
not deployed in the same geographical area. For such a case of operation
with overlapping frequency arrangements in the same geographical area,
special co-existence requirements may apply that are not covered by the
3GPP specifications.

NOTE 3: For the protection of DCS1800, UTRA Band III, E-UTRA Band 3 or
NR Band n3 in China, the frequency ranges of the downlink and uplink
protection requirements are 1805 -- 1850 MHz and 1710 -- 1755 MHz
respectively.

NOTE 4: TDD base stations deployed in the same geographical area, that
are synchronized and use the same or adjacent operating bands can
transmit without additional co-existence requirements. For
unsynchronized base stations, special co-existence requirements may
apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.

NOTE 5: For Band 28/n28 BS, specific solutions may be required to fulfil
the spurious emissions limits for BS for co-existence with Band 27 UL
operating band.

NOTE 6: For Band 29 BS, specific solutions may be required to fulfil the
spurious emissions limits for BS for co‑existence with UTRA Band XII,
E-UTRA Band 12 or NR Band n12 UL operating band, E-UTRA Band 17 UL
operating band or E-UTRA Band 85 UL operating band.

The following requirement may be applied for the protection of PHS. This
requirement is also applicable at specified frequencies falling between
Δf~OBUE~ below the lowest BS transmitter frequency of the downlink
operating band and Δf~OBUE~ above the highest BS transmitter frequency
of the downlink operating band.

The basic limit for any spurious emission is:

Table 6.6.6.5.2.5-2: Spurious emissions *basic limits* for co-existence
with PHS

  Frequency range                                     *Basic limit*   Measurement Bandwidth   Notes

  NOTE: The requirement is not applicable in China.                                           

Table 6.6.6.5.2.5-3: Void

The following requirement shall be applied to *TAB connectors* operating
in Bands 13 and 14 to ensure that appropriate interference protection is
provided to 700 MHz public safety operations. This requirement is also
applicable at the frequency range from 10 MHz below the lowest frequency
of the BS transmitter operating band up to 10 MHz above the highest
frequency of the BS transmitter operating band. The basic limit for any
spurious emission is:

  14               799 - 805 MHz   -46 dBm         6.25 kHz

The following requirement shall be applied to *TAB connectors* operating
in Band 26 to ensure that appropriate interference protection is
provided to 800 MHz public safety operations. This requirement is also
applicable at the frequency range from 10 MHz below the lowest frequency
of the BS downlink operating band up to 10 MHz above the highest
frequency of the BS downlink operating band.

The basic limit for any spurious emission is:

Table 6.6.6.5.2.5-5: BS Spurious emissions *basic limits* for protection
of 800 MHz public safety operations

  Operating Band   Frequency range   Basic limit   Measurement Bandwidth   Notes

Table 6.6.6.5.2.5-6: Void

In addition to the requirements in clauses 6.6.6.5.2.1 to 6.6.6.5.2.5
and above in the present clause, the *TAB connector* may have to comply
with the applicable emission limits established by FCC Title 47 \[24\],
when deployed in regions where those limits are applied, and under the
conditions declared by the manufacturer.

The following requirement may apply to a *TAB connector* operating in
Band 30 in certain regions. This requirement is also applicable at the
frequency range from 10 MHz below the lowest frequency of the BS
downlink operating band up to 10 MHz above the highest frequency of the
BS downlink operating band.

The basic limit for any spurious emission is:

The following requirement may apply to E-UTRA BS operating in Band 48 in
certain regions. The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:

##### 6.6.6.5.2.6 Co-location with other Base Stations {#co-location-with-other-base-stations .H6}

These requirements may be applied for the protection of other BS
receiver units when GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850, CDMA850, UTRA FDD,
UTRA TDD, E-UTRA and/or NR BS are co-located with a BS.

The requirements assume a 30 dB coupling loss between transmitter and
receiver and are based on co-location with base stations of the same
class.

The basic limit for any spurious emission are in table 6.6.6.5.2.6-1 for
a MSR, E-UTRA or UTRA FDD *TAB connector* or tables 6.6.6.5.2.6-2 and
6.6.6.5.2.6-3 for UTRA TDD, where requirements for co-location with a BS
type listed in the first column apply, depending on the declared Base
Station class. For a *multi-band TAB connector*, the exclusions and
conditions in the Notes column of table 6.6.6.5.2.6-1 apply for each
supported operating band.

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause,
the co-location requirements in table 6.6.6.5.2.6-1 do not apply for the
Δf~OBUE~ frequency range immediately outside the *TAB connector*
transmit frequency range of a downlink operating band (clause 4.5). The
current state-of-the-art technology does not allow a single generic
solution for co-location with other system on adjacent frequencies for
30 dB BS-BS minimum coupling loss. However, there are certain
site-engineering solutions that can be used. These techniques are
addressed in TR 25.942 \[21\].

NOTE 2: Table 6.6.6.5.2.6-1 assumes that two operating bands, where the
corresponding *TAB connector* transmit and receive frequency ranges in
clause 4.5 would be overlapping, are not deployed in the same
geographical area. For such a case of operation with overlapping
frequency arrangements in the same geographical area, special
co-location requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP
specifications.

NOTE 3: Co-located TDD Base Stations that are synchronized and using the
same or adjacent operating band can transmit without special
co-locations requirements. For unsynchronized Base Stations, special
co-location requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP
specifications.

NOTE 4: For UTRA MR BS the measurement bandwidth is the same as for
E-UTRA (100 kHz).

6.7 Transmitter intermodulation
-------------------------------

### 6.7.1 Definition and applicability

#### 6.7.1.1 General

The transmitter intermodulation requirement is a measure of the
capability of the transmitter unit to inhibit the generation of signals
in its non-linear elements caused by presence of the wanted signal and
an interfering signal reaching the transmitter unit via the RDN and
antenna array. The requirement applies during the *transmitter ON
period* and the *transmitter transient period*.

The requirement applies at each *TAB connector* supporting transmission
in the operating band.

The transmitter intermodulation level is the power of the
intermodulation products when an interfering signal is injected into the
*TAB connector*.

For AAS BS there are two types of transmitter intermodulation cases
captured by the transmitter intermodulation requirement:

1\) Co-location transmitter intermodulation in which the interfering
signal is from a co-located base station.

2\) Intra-system transmitter intermodulation in which the interfering
signal is from other transmitter units within the AAS BS.

For AAS BS, the co-location transmitter intermodulation requirement is
considered sufficient if the interfering signal for the co-location
requirement is higher than the declared interfering signal for
intra-system transmitter intermodulation requirement.

For *TAB connectors* capable of multi-band operation where multiple
bands are mapped on separate antenna connectors, the single-band
requirements apply regardless of the interfering signals position
relative to the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*.

### 6.7.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement for MSR operation are defined in
TS 37.105 \[8\], clause 6.7.2.

The minimum requirement for UTRA operation are defined in
TS 37.105 \[8\], clause 6.7.3.

The minimum requirement for UTRA operation are defined in
TS 37.105 \[8\], clause 6.7.4.

### 6.7.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify the ability of the transmitter units
associated with the *TAB connector* under test to restrict the
generation of intermodulation products in its nonlinear elements caused
by presence of the wanted signal and an interfering signal reaching the
transmitter via the antenna to below specified levels.

### 6.7.4 Method of test

#### 6.7.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment:

\- normal; see clause B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier:

\- M; see clause 4.12.1.

*Base Station RF Bandwidth* positions to be tested for multi-carrier:

\- M~RFBW~ in single-band operation; see clause 4.12.1;
B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ in multi-band operation, see
clause 4.12.1.

#### 6.7.4.2 Procedure

The minimum requirement is applied to all *TAB connectors*, they may be
tested one at a time or multiple *TAB connectors* may be tested in
parallel as shown in clause D.1.1. Whichever method is used the
procedure is repeated until all *TAB connectors* necessary to
demonstrate conformance have been tested.

1\) Connect *TAB connector* to measurement equipment as shown in annex
D.1.2. All *TAB connectors* not under test shall be terminated.

2\) The measurement device characteristics shall be:

\- Detection mode: True RMS.

The emission power should be averaged over an appropriate time duration
to ensure the measurement is within the measurement uncertainty in Table
4.1.2.2-1.

3\) Set the set the *TAB connector* to transmit:

a\) For MSR:

\- Set the *TAB connector* to transmit maximum power according to the
applicable test configuration in clause 5 using the corresponding test
models or set of physical channels in clause 4.11.

b\) For UTRA FDD:

\- For a *TAB connector* declared to be capable of single carrier
operation only, set the *TAB connector* to transmit a signal according
to TM1, clause 4.12.2, at the manufacturer\'s declared rated output
power, P~rated,c,TABC~.

\- For a *TAB connector* declared to be capable of multi-carrier
operation, set the set the *TAB connector* to transmit according to TM1
on all carriers configured using the applicable test configuration and
corresponding power setting specified in clause 4.11.

c\) For UTRA TDD:

\- For a *TAB connector* declared to be capable of single carrier
operation only, set the parameters of the transmitted signal according
to table 6.7.4.2-1.

\- For a *TAB connector* declared to be capable of multi-carrier
operation, set to transmit according to table 6.7.4.2-1on all carriers.

7 Conducted receiver characteristics
====================================

7.1 General
-----------

Unless otherwise stated, the receiver characteristics are specified at
the AAS BS *TAB connector* with full complement of transceivers for the
configuration in normal operating condition.

The manufacturer shall declare the minimum number of supported
geographical cells (i.e. geographical areas) in clause 4.10. The minimum
number of supported geographical cells (N~cells~) relates to the AAS BS
setting with minimum amount of cell splitting. The manufacturer shall
also declare *TAB connector RX min cell groups for this minimum number
of cells configuration*. Every *TAB connector* supporting reception in
an operating band shall map to one *TAB connector RX min cell group*
supporting the same. The mapping of *TAB connectors* to cells is
implementation dependent.

The number of active receiver units that are considered when calculating
the emission limit (N~RXU,counted~) for an AAS base station is
calculated as follows:

\- N~RXU,counted~ = *min(N~RXU,active~, 8* ·*N~cells~)* for E-UTRA
single RAT AAS BS and MSR AAS BS (excluding UTRA only MSR AAS BS).

And

\- N~RXU,counted~ = *min(N~RXU,\ active~, 4* ·*N~cells~)* for UTRA
single RAT AAS BS and UTRA only MSR AAS BS.

Further:

\- N~RXU,countedpercell~ = *N~RXU,counted~/N~cells~*

N~RXU,countedpercell~ is used for scaling the *basic limits* as
described in clause 7.6.

NOTE: N~RXU,active~ is the number of actually active receiver units and
is independent to the declaration of N~cells~.

If a number of *TAB connectors* have been declared equivalent (see table
4.10-1, D6.70), only a representative one is necessary to demonstrate
conformance.

In clause 7.6.5.1, if representative *TAB connectors* are used then per
connector criteria (option 2) shall be applied.

Any receiver test requirement specified for Band 46 operation in
TS 36.104 \[4\] for E-UTRA, or in TS 37.104 \[5\] for E-UTRA in *MSR
operation*, and referred in clause 6, is not applicable for AAS BS. The
requirements for co-location blocking for Band 46 are applicable for AAS
BS.

Any receiver requirement specified for NB-IoT in-band, NB-IoT guard
band, or standalone NB-IoT operation in TS 36.104 \[4\] for E-UTRA with
NB-IoT (in-band or guard band) or for standalone NB-IoT, or in
TS 37.104 \[5\] for E-UTRA with NB-IoT or standalone NB-IoT in *MSR
operation*, and referred in clause 7, is not applicable for AAS BS.

  NOTE: The wanted signal mean power is the power level of a single instance of the corresponding reference measurement channel. This requirement shall be met for each consecutive application of a single instance of the reference measurement channel mapped to disjoint frequency ranges with a width corresponding to the number of resource blocks of the reference measurement channel each, except for one instance that might overlap one other instance to cover the full *BS channel bandwidth*.

  NOTE: The wanted signal mean power is the power level of a single instance of the corresponding reference measurement channel. This requirement shall be met for each consecutive application of a single instance of the reference measurement channel mapped to disjoint frequency ranges with a width corresponding to the number of resource blocks of the reference measurement channel each, except for one instance that might overlap one other instance to cover the full *BS channel bandwidth*.

  NOTE: The wanted signal mean power is the power level of a single instance of the corresponding reference measurement channel. This requirement shall be met for each consecutive application of a single instance of the reference measurement channel mapped to disjoint frequency ranges with a width corresponding to the number of resource blocks of the reference measurement channel each, except for one instance that might overlap one other instance to cover the full *BS channel bandwidth*.                                                                                                                                                  

NOTE: If the above Test Requirement differs from the Minimum Requirement
then the Test Tolerance applied for this test is non-zero. The
relationship between Minimum Requirements and Test Requirements is
defined in clause 4.1 and the explanation of how the Minimum Requirement
has been adjusted by the Test Tolerance is given in Annex C.

7.4 Adjacent channel selectivity and narrowband blocking
--------------------------------------------------------

### 7.4.1 Definition and applicability

The adjacent channel selectivity, general blocking and narrowband
blocking characteristics are measures of the receiver unit ability to
receive a wanted signal at its assigned channel at the *TAB connector*
in the presence of an unwanted interferer inside the operating band.

NOTE For Single RAT requirements, the in-band selectivity
characteristics is referred to as \"adjacent channel selectivity\",
whereas for the MSR requirements, the corresponding property is referred
to as \"general blocking\" since the adjacent frequency range may not
carry a channel addressable from the interfered carrier.

The in-band blocking requirement applies from F~UL\_low~ - Δf~OOB~ to

Table 7.4.5.1.1-2: Void

> NOTE: The requirement in tables 7.4.5.1.1-1 assumes that two operating
> bands, where the *downlink operating band* (see table 4.4-1 and table
> 4.4-2 in TS 37.141 \[16\].) of one band would be within the in-band
> blocking region of the other band, are not deployed in the same
> geographical area.

##### 7.4.5.1.2 General narrowband blocking test requirement

For the narrowband blocking requirement, the interfering signal shall be
an E-UTRA 1RB signal as specified in clause A.3 in TS 37.141 \[16\].

The requirement is applicable outside the *Base Station RF Bandwidth* or
*Maximum Radio Bandwidth*. The interfering signal offset is defined
relative to the *Base Station RF Bandwidth* *edges* or *Maximum Radio
Bandwidth* edges.

For a *TAB connector* operating in non-contiguous spectrum, the
requirement applies in addition inside any *sub-block gap*, in case the
*sub-block gap* size is at least 3 MHz. The interfering signal offset is
defined relative to the sub-block edges inside the *sub-block gap*.

For a *multi-band TAB connector*, the requirement applies in addition
inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* in case the gap size is at least 3
MHz. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the *Base
Station RF Bandwidth* *edges* inside the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*.

For the wanted and interfering signal coupled to the *TAB connector*,
using the parameters in table 7.4.5.1.2-1 the following requirements
shall be met:

\- For any measured E-UTRA carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the
*maximum throughput* of the reference measurement channel defined in
clause 7.2.5.3.

\- For any measured UTRA FDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0.001 for
the reference measurement channel defined in clause 7.2.5.1.

\- For any measured UTRA TDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0.001 for
the reference measurement channel defined in clause 7.2.5.2.

##### 7.4.5.1.3 Additional BC3 blocking test requirement

This additional requirement only applies for BS operating in the same
geographical area as UTRA TDD.

The interfering signal is a 1,28Mcps UTRA TDD modulated signal as
specified in clause A.2 in TS 37.141 \[16\].

The requirement is applicable outside the *Base Station RF Bandwidth* or
*Maximum Radio Bandwidth*. The interfering signal offset is defined
relative to the *Base Station RF Bandwidth* *edges* or *Maximum Radio
Bandwidth* edges.

For a *multi-band TAB connector*, the requirement applies in addition
inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*, in case the gap size is at least
4.8MHz. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the *Base
Station RF Bandwidth* *edges* inside the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*.

For the wanted and interfering signal coupled to the *TAB connector*,
using the parameters in table 7.4.5.1.3-1, the following requirements
shall be met:

\- For any measured E-UTRA carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the
*maximum throughput* of the reference measurement channel defined in
clause 7.2.5.3.

\- For any measured UTRA TDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0.001 for
the reference measurement channel defined in clause 7.2.5.2.

#### 7.4.5.2 Single RAT UTRA FDD operation

For each measured carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0,001 for the
parameters specified in table 7.4.5.2-1.

For *multi-carrier TAB connector* the ACS requirement is applicable
outside the *Base Station RF Bandwidth* or *Maximum Radio Bandwidth*.
The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the lower/upper
*Base Station RF Bandwidth* *edges* or *Maximum Radio Bandwidth* edges.

For a *TAB connector* operating in non-contiguous spectrum within any
operating band, the requirement applies in addition inside any
*sub-block gap*, in case the *sub-block gap* size is at least 5 MHz. The
interfering signal offset is defined relative to the lower/upper
sub-block edge inside the *sub-block gap* and is equal to -2.5 MHz/+2.5
MHz, respectively.

For a *multi-band TAB connector*, the requirement applies in addition
inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*, in case the *Inter RF Bandwidth
gap* size is at least 5 MHz. The interfering signal offset is defined
relative to lower/upper *Base Station RF Bandwidth* *edges* inside the
*Inter RF Bandwidth gap* and is equal to -2.5 MHz/+2.5 MHz,
respectively.

The BER, measured on the wanted signal in the presence of an interfering
signal, shall not exceed 0,001 for the parameters specified in table
7.4.5.3-1.

The ACS requirement is always applicable outside the *Base Station RF
Bandwidth* or *Maximum Radio Bandwidth* edges. The interfering signal
offset is defined relative to the lower / upper *Base Station RF
Bandwidth* *edges* or *Maximum Radio Bandwidth* edges.

For *multi-band TAB connector*, the requirement applies in addition
inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* as long as the *Inter RF Bandwidth
gap* size is at least 1.6MHz. The interfering signal offset is defined
relative to the lower / upper *Base Station RF Bandwidth* *edges* inside
the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* and is equal to -0.8MHz/+0.8MHz,
respectively.

For each measured E-UTRA carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the
*maximum throughput* of the reference measurement channel.

For AAS BS of wide area BS class the wanted and the interfering signal
coupled to the *TAB connector* are specified in table 7.4.5.4-1 and
7.4.5.4-2 for narrowband blocking and 7.4.5.4-3 for ACS. The reference
measurement channel for the wanted signal is specified in table
7.2.5.3-1for each channel bandwidth and further specified in annex A in
TS 36.141 \[17\].

For AAS BS of Medium Range BS class, the wanted and the interfering
signal coupled to the *TAB connector* are specified in tables 7.4.5.4-1
and 7.4.5.4-2 for narrowband blocking and in table 7.4.5.4-5 for ACS.
The reference measurement channel for the wanted signal is specified in
table 7.2.5.3-3 for each channel bandwidth and further specified in
annex A in TS 36.141 \[17\].

For AAS BS of Local Area BS class, the wanted and the interfering signal
coupled to the *TAB connector* are specified in tables 7.4.5.4-1 and

The ACS and narrowband blocking requirement is always applicable outside
the *Base Station RF Bandwidth* or Maximum *Radio Bandwidth*. The
interfering signal offset is defined relative to the *Base station RF
Bandwidth edges* or Maximum *Radio Bandwidth* edges.

For a *TAB connector* operating in non-contiguous spectrum within any
operating band, the ACS requirement applies in addition inside any
*sub-block gap*, in case the *sub-block gap* size is at least as wide as
the E-UTRA interfering signal in tables 7.4.5.4-3, 7.4.5.4-4 and
7.4.5.4-5. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the
sub-block edges inside the *sub-block gap*.

For a *multi-band TAB connector*, the ACS requirement applies in
addition inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*, in case the *Inter RF
Bandwidth gap* size is at least as wide as the E-UTRA interfering signal
in tables 7.4.5.4-3, 7.4.5.4-4 and 7.4.5.4-5. The interfering signal
offset is defined relative to the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edges*
inside the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*.

For a *TAB connector* operating in non-contiguous spectrum within any
operating band, the narrowband blocking requirement applies in addition
inside any *sub-block gap*, in case the *sub-block gap* size is at least
as wide as the channel bandwidth of the E-UTRA interfering signal in
table 7.4.5.4-2. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to
the sub-block edges inside the *sub-block gap*.

For a *multi-band TAB connector*, the narrowband blocking requirement
applies in addition inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*, in case the
*Inter RF Bandwidth gap* size is at least as wide as the E-UTRA
interfering signal in table 7.4.5.4-2. The interfering signal offset is
defined relative to the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edges* inside the

NOTE: If the above Test Requirement differs from the Minimum Requirement
then the Test Tolerance applied for this test is non-zero. The Test
Tolerance for this test is defined in clause 4.1.2 and the explanation
of how the Minimum Requirement has been relaxed by the Test Tolerance is
given in annex C.

7.5 Blocking
------------

### 7.5.1 Definition and applicability

The out-of-band blocking characteristic is a measure of the receiver
ability to receive a wanted signal at its assigned channel in the
presence of an unwanted interferer outside the *uplink operating band*.

### 7.5.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement for MSR operation is in TS 37.105 \[8\],
clause 7.5.2.

The minimum requirement for single RAT UTRA operation is in
TS 37.105 \[8\], clause 7.5.3.

The minimum requirement for single RAT E-UTRA operation is in
TS 37.105 \[8\], clause 7.5.4.

The minimum requirement for NR operation is in TS 38.104 \[36\],
clause 7.5.2.

### 7.5.3 Test purpose

The test stresses the ability of the receiver unit associated with the
*TAB connector* under test to withstand high-level interference from
unwanted signals at specified frequency bands, without undue degradation
of its sensitivity.

### 7.5.4 Method of test

#### 7.5.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment:

\- Normal; see clause B.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier (SC):

\- M; see clause 4.12.1

*Base Station RF Bandwidth p*ositions to be tested for multi-carrier
(MC):

\- M~RFBW~ for *single-band TAB connector(s)*, see clause 4.12.1,
B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ for *multi-band TAB
connector(s),* see clause 4.12.1.

In addition, for *multi-band TAB connectors*:

\- For B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~, out-of-band blocking testing above the
highest operating band may be omitted.

\- For B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~, out-of-band blocking testing below the lowest
operating band may be omitted.

#### 7.5.4.2 Procedure

##### 7.5.4.2.1 General Procedure

The general procedure steps apply to the procedures for all the RATs.

The minimum requirement is applied to all *TAB connectors,* the
procedure is repeated until all *TAB connectors* necessary to
demonstrate conformance have been tested; see clause 7.1:

1\) Connect *TAB connector* to measurement equipment as shown in annex
D.2.3. All *TAB connectors* not under test shall be terminated.

##### 7.5.4.2.2 MSR operation

#### 7.5.5.2 Single RAT UTRA FDD operation

For each measured carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0.001 for the
parameters specified in tables 7.5.5.2-1 to 7.5.5.2-9 if applicable for
the *TAB connector* under test.

The requirement is applicable outside the *Base Station RF Bandwidth* or
*Maximum Radio Bandwidth*. The interfering signal offset is defined
relative to the lower/upper *Base Station RF Bandwidth edges* or
*Maximum Radio Bandwidth* edges.

For a *TAB connector* operating in non-contiguous spectrum within any
operating band, the blocking requirement applies in addition inside any
*sub-block gap*, in case the *sub-block gap* size is at least 15 MHz.
The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the lower/upper
sub-block edge inside the *sub-block gap* and is equal to -7.5 MHz/+7.5
MHz, respectively.

For a *TAB connector* operating in non-contiguous spectrum within any
operating band, the narrowband blocking requirements in tables 7.5.5.2-7
to 7.5.5.2-9 apply in addition inside any *sub-block gap*, in case the
*sub-block gap* size is at least 400 kHz or 600 kHz, depending on the
operating band. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the
lower/upper sub-block edge inside the *sub-block gap* and is equal to
-200 kHz/+200 kHz or -300 kHz/+300 kHz, respectively.

For a *multi-band TAB connector*, the requirement in the in-band
blocking frequency range applies for each supported operating band. The
requirement applies in addition inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*, in
case the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* size is at least 15 MHz. The
interfering signal offset is defined relative to lower/upper *Base
Station RF bandwidth edges* inside the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* and is
equal to -7.5 MHz/+7.5 MHz, respectively.

For a *multi-band TAB connector*, the requirement in the out-of-band
blocking frequency ranges apply for each operating band, with the
exception that the in-band blocking frequency ranges of all supported
operating bands according to tables 7.5.5.2-1 to 7.5.5.2-3 shall be
excluded from the out-of-band blocking requirement.

For a *multi-band TAB connector*, the narrowband blocking requirement
applies in addition inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*, in case the
*Inter RF Bandwidth gap* size is at least 400 kHz or 600 kHz, depending
on the operating band. The interfering signal offset is defined relative
to lower/upper *Base Station RF Bandwidth edges* inside the *Inter RF
Bandwidth gap* and is equal to -200 kHz/+200 kHz or -300 kHz/+300 kHz,
respectively.

NOTE 1: If the above Test Requirement differs from the Minimum
Requirement then the Test Tolerance applied for this test is non-zero.
The Test Tolerance for this test is defined in clause 4.1.2 and the
explanation of how the Minimum Requirement has been relaxed by the Test
Tolerance is given in annex C.

NOTE 2: Annex C of TS 25.141 \[18\] describes the procedure for BER
tests taking into account the statistical consequence of frequent
repetition of BER measurements within the blocking test. The consequence
is: a DUT exactly on the limit may fail due to the statistical nature
2.55 times (mean value) in 12750 BER measurements using the predefined
wrong decision probability of 0.02%. If the fail cases are ≤ 12, it is
allowed to repeat the fail cases 1 time before the final verdict.

#### 7.5.5.3 Single RAT UTRA TDD 1,28 Mcps option operation

##### 7.5.5.3.1 General requirements

The static reference performance as specified in clause 7.2 shall be met
with a wanted and an interfering signal coupled to the *TAB connector*
using the parameters specified in table 7.5.5.3.1-1 to table
7.5.5.3.1-12, respectively.

The blocking requirement is always applicable outside the *Base Station
RF Bandwidth* or *Maximum Radio Bandwidth* edges. The interfering signal
offset is defined relative to the lower / upper *Base Station RF
Bandwidth* *edges* or *Maximum Radio Bandwidth* edges.

For *multi-band TAB connector*, the requirement in the in-band blocking
frequency range applies for each supported operating band. The
requirements applies in addition inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* as
long as the Inter RF Bandwidth gap size is at least 4.8MHz. The
interfering signal offset is defined relative to the lower / upper *Base
Station RF Bandwidth* *edges* inside the Inter RF Bandwidth gap and is
equal to -2.4 MHz/+2.4 MHz, respectively.

For *multi-band TAB connector*, the requirement in the out-of-band
blocking frequency ranges apply for each supported operating band, with
the exception that the in-band blocking frequency ranges of all
supported operating bands shall be excluded from the out-of-band
blocking requirement.

##### 7.5.5.3.2 Co-location with GSM, DCS, UTRA FDD and/or E-UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD and/or E-UTRA TDD

This additional blocking requirement may be applied for the protection
of receiver units associated with *TAB connectors* with TDD operation
when GSM, DCS, UTRA FDD, E-UTRA FDD, FDD unsynchronized UTRA TDD and/or
unsynchronized E-UTRA TDD BTS operating in a different frequency band
are co-located with UTRA TDD Wide Area BS.

The blocking performance requirement applies to interfering signals with
centre frequency within the ranges specified in the tables below, using
a 1 MHz step size.

In case this additional blocking requirement is applied, the static
reference performance as specified in clause 7.2.1 shall be met with a
wanted and an interfering signal coupled to BS antenna input using the
following parameters.

and an interfering signal coupled to BS antenna input using the
parameters in tables 7.5.5.4.1-1, 7.5.5.4.1-2, 7.5.5.4.1-3 and
7.5.5.4.1-4. The reference measurement channel for the wanted signal is
specified in tables 7.2.5.3-1, 7.2.5.3-2 and 7.2.5.3-3 for each channel
bandwidth and further specified in TS 36.141 \[17\], Annex A.

The blocking requirement is always applicable outside the *Base Station
RF Bandwidth* or *Maximum Radio Bandwidth*. The interfering signal
offset is defined relative to the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edges* or
*Maximum Radio Bandwidth* edges.

For a *TAB connector* operating in non-contiguous spectrum within any
operating band, the blocking requirement applies in addition inside any
*sub-block gap*, in case the *sub-block gap* size is at least as wide as
twice the interfering signal minimum offset in table 7.6-2. The
interfering signal offset is defined relative to the sub-block edges
inside the *sub-block gap*.

For a *multi-band TAB connector*, the requirement in the in-band
blocking frequency ranges applies for each supported operating band. The
requirement applies in addition inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*, in
case the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* size is at least as wide as twice the
interfering signal minimum offset in table 7.6-2.

For a *multi-band TAB connector*, the requirement in the out-of-band
blocking frequency ranges apply for each operating band, with the
exception that the in-band blocking frequency ranges of all supported
operating bands according to tables 7.5.5.4.1-1, 7.5.5.4.1-2 and
7.5.5.4.1-3 shall be excluded from the out-of-band blocking requirement.

NOTE 4: If the above Test Requirement differs from the Minimum
Requirement then the Test Tolerance applied for this test is non-zero.
The Test Tolerance for this test is defined in clause 4.1.2 and the
explanation of how the Minimum Requirement has been relaxed by the Test
Tolerance is given in annex C.

##### 7.5.5.4.2 Co-location with other base stations

This additional blocking requirement may be applied for the protection
of E-UTRA receiver units associated with the *TAB connectors* under test
when GSM, CMDA, UTRA or E-UTRA BS operating in a different frequency
band are co-located with an E-UTRA BS. The requirement is applicable to
all channel bandwidths supported by the E-UTRA BS.

The requirements in this clause assume a 30 dB coupling loss between
interfering transmitter and E-UTRA BS receiver and are based on
co-location with base stations of the same class.

For each measured E-UTRA carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the
*maximum throughput* of the reference measurement channel, with a wanted
and an interfering signal coupled to the *TAB connector* using the
parameters in table 7.5.5.4.2-1 for AAS BS of Wide Area BS class, in
table 7.5.5.4.2-2 for AAS BS of Local Area BS class and in table
7.5.5.4.2-3 for AAS BS of Medium Range BS class. The reference
measurement channel for the wanted signal is specified in tables
7.2.5.3-1, 7.2.5.3-2 and 7.2.5.3-4 for each channel bandwidth and
further specified in annex A of TS 36.141 \[17\].

Table 7.5.5.4.2-3: Void

7.6 Receiver spurious emissions
-------------------------------

### 7.6.1 Definition and applicability

The receiver spurious emissions power is the power of emissions
generated or amplified in a receiver unit that appear at the *TAB
connector*. The requirements apply to all AAS BS with separate RX and TX
*TAB connectors*.

NOTE: In this case for FDD AAS BS the test is performed when both TX and
RX are on, with the TX *TAB connector* terminated.

For a *TAB connector* supporting both RX and TX in TDD, the requirements
apply during the *transmitter OFF period*. For a *TAB connector*
supporting both RX and TX in FDD, the receiver spurious requirements are
superseded by the TX spurious requirements in TS 37.105 \[8\],
clause 6.6.6.

For RX only *multi-band TAB connector(s)*, the RX spurious emissions
requirements are subject to exclusion zones in each supported operating
band. For *multi-band TAB connector(s)* that both transmit and receive
in operating bands supporting TDD, RX spurious emissions requirements
are applicable during the TX OFF period~~,~~ and are subject to
exclusion zones in each supported operating band. *The unwanted emission
level limit of a TAB connector RX min cell group is in general defined
by the unwanted emission basic limit which is the same as the
corresponding applicable Non-AAS BS per transmitter requirement
specified in \[3\], \[4\], or \[5\], and its scaling by*
N~RXU,countedpercell~ . The *basic limits* and corresponding scaling are
defined in each relevant clause. The receiver spurious emission
requirements are applied per the *TAB connector RX min cell groups for
all the configurations supported by the AAS BS.*

### 7.6.2 Minimum Requirement

The minimum requirement for MSR operation is in TS 37.105 \[8\],
clause 7.6.2.

The minimum requirement for single RAT UTRA operation is defined in
TS 37.105 \[8\], clause 7.6.3.

The minimum requirement for single RAT E-UTRA operation is defined in
TS 37.105 \[8\], clause 7.6.4.

### 7.6.3 Test Purpose

The test purpose is to verify the ability of the AAS BS to limit the
interference caused by receiver spurious emissions to other systems.

### 7.6.4 Method of test

#### 7.6.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment:

\- normal; see clause B.2

RF channels to be tested for single carrier:

clause 7.6.1, they may be tested one at a time or multiple *TAB
connectors* may be tested in parallel as shown in annex D.2.4. Whichever
method is used the procedure is repeated until all *TAB connectors*
necessary to demonstrate conformance have been tested; see clause 7.1.

1\) Connect *TAB connector* to measurement equipment as shown in annex
D.2.4. All *TAB connectors* not under test shall be terminated.

For TDD connectors capable of transmit and receive ensure the
transmitter is OFF.

test to transmit with the carrier set-up and power allocation according
to the applicable test configuration(s), see clause 5.

3\) Measure the spurious emissions over each frequency range described
in clause 7.6.5.2.1.

In addition, for *multi-band TAB connector(s)*, the following steps
shall apply:

4\) For *multi-band TAB connectors* and single band tests, repeat the
steps above per involved band where single band test configurations and
test models shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

##### 7.6.4.2.3 Single RAT UTRA FDD operation

1\) For *TAB connector(s)* capable of single carrier operation only, set
each *TAB connector* declared in the same RAT and operating band to
transmit a signal according to TM1, (clause 4.12.2), at the
manufacturer\'s declared rated output power, P~Rated,c,TABC~.

For *TAB connector(s)* declared to be capable of multi-carrier
operation, set each *TAB connector* declared in the same RAT and
operating band to transmit a signal according to TM1on all carriers
configured, using the applicable test configuration and corresponding
power setting for receiver tests, as specified in clause 4.11.

##### 7.7.5.1.2 General narrowband intermodulation test requirement

Interfering signals shall be a CW signal and an E-UTRA 1RB signal, as
specified in annex A of TS 37.141 \[16\].

The requirement is applicable outside the *Base Station RF Bandwidth* or
maximum *Radio Bandwidth*. The interfering signal offset is defined
relative to the *Base Station RF bandwidth edges* or maximum *Radio
Bandwidth* edges.

For a *TAB connector* operating in non-contiguous spectrum within each
supported operating band, the requirement applies in addition inside any
*sub-block gap* in case the *sub-block gap* is at least as wide as the
channel bandwidth of the E-UTRA interfering signal in table 7.7.5.1.2-2.
The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the sub-block edges
inside the gap.

For a *multi-band TAB connector*, the requirement applies in addition
inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* in case the gap size is at least as
wide as the E-UTRA interfering signal in table 7.7.5.1.2-2. The
interfering signal offset is defined relative to the RF bandwidth edges
inside the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*.

For the wanted signal at the assigned channel frequency and two
interfering signals coupled to the Base Station antenna input, using the
parameters in table 7.7.5.2-1 and 7.7.5.2-2, the following requirements
shall be met:

\- For any measured E-UTRA carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the
*maximum throughput* of the reference measurement channel defined in
clause 7.2.5.3.

\- For any NR carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channel defined in
TS 38.104 \[36\], clause 7.2.5.4.

\- For any measured UTRA FDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0.001 for
the reference measurement channel defined in clause 7.2.5.1.

\- For any measured UTRA TDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0.001 for
the reference measurement channel defined in clause 7.2.5.2.

measurement channel for the wanted signal is specified in tables
7.2.5.3-1, 7.2.5.3-2 and 7.2.5.3-3 for each channel bandwidth and
further specified in annex A of TS 36.141 \[17\].

The receiver intermodulation requirement is always applicable outside
the *Base Station RF bandwidth* or maximum *Radio Bandwidth* edges. The
interfering signal offset is defined relative to the lower (upper) or
maximum *Radio Bandwidth* edges.

For a *TAB connector* operating in non-contiguous spectrum within any
operating band, the narrowband intermodulation requirement applies in
addition inside any *sub-block gap* in case the *sub-block gap* is at
least as wide as the channel bandwidth of the E-UTRA interfering signal
in table 7.7.5.4-3. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to
the sub-block edges inside the *sub-block gap*. The requirement applies
separately for both sub-blocks.

For a *multi-band TAB connector*, the intermodulation requirement
applies in addition inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*, in case the gap
size is at least twice as wide as the E-UTRA interfering signal centre
frequency offset from the *Base Station RF bandwidth* *edge*.

For a *multi-band TAB connector*, the narrowband intermodulation
requirement applies in addition inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* in
case the gap size is at least as wide as the E-UTRA interfering signal
in tables 7.7.5.4-3, 7.7.5.4-4 and 7.7.5.4-5. The interfering signal
offset is defined relative to the *Base Station RF bandwidth* *edges*

NOTE: If the above Test Requirement differs from the Minimum Requirement
then the Test Tolerance applied for this test is non-zero. The Test
Tolerance for this test is defined in clause 4.1.2 and the explanation
of how the Minimum Requirement has been relaxed by the Test Tolerance is
given in annex C.

7.8 In-channel selectivity
--------------------------

### 7.8.1 Definition and applicability

In-channel selectivity (ICS) is a measure of the receiver unit ability
to receive a wanted signal at its assigned resource block locations in
the presence of an interfering signal received at a larger power
spectral density. In this condition a throughput requirement shall be
met for a specified reference measurement channel. The requirement
applies per *TAB connector*.

### 7.8.2 Minimum requirement

The minimum requirement for E-UTRA operation is defined in
TS 37.105 \[8\], clause 7.8.4.

The minimum requirement for MSR operation is defined in TS 37.105 \[8\],
clause 7.8.2.

### 7.8.3 Test purpose

The purpose of this test is to verify the ability of the receiver unit
associated with the *TAB connector* under test to suppress the IQ
leakage.

### 7.8.4 Method of test

#### 7.8.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment:

\- normal; see clause B.2

RF channels to be tested for single carrier:

\- M; see clause 4.12.1.

#### 7.8.4.2 Procedure

The minimum requirement is applied to all *TAB connectors,* the
procedure is repeated until all *TAB connectors* necessary to
demonstrate conformance have been tested; see clause 7.1.

1\) Connect *TAB connector* to measurement equipment as shown in annex
D.2.5. All *TAB connectors* not under test shall be terminated.

For each supported E-UTRA channel BW:

2\) Adjust the signal generator for the wanted signal as specified in
table 7.8.5-1 for AAS BS of Wide Area BS class, in table 7.8.5-2 for AAS
BS of Local Area BS class and in table 7.8.5-3 for AAS BS of Medium
Range BS class on one side of the F~C~.

3\) Adjust the signal generator for the interfering signal as specified
in table 7.8.5-1 for AAS BS of Wide Area BS class, in table 7.8.5-2 for
AAS BS of Local Area BS class and in table 7.8.5-3 for AAS BS of Medium
Range BS class at opposite side of the F~C~ and adjacent to the wanted
signal.

4\) Measure throughput.

5\) Repeat the measurement with the wanted signal on the other side of
the F~C~, and the interfering signal at opposite side of the F~C~ and
adjacent to the wanted signal.

In addition, for *multi-band TAB connector(s)*, the following steps
shall apply:

6\) For *multi-band TAB connectors* and single band tests, repeat the
steps above per involved band where single band test configurations and
test models shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

### 7.8.5 Test requirements

For each measured E-UTRA carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the
*maximum throughput* of the reference measurement channel as specified
in \[Annex A\] with parameters specified in table 7.8.5-1 for AAS BS of
Wide Area BS, class in Table7.8.5-2 for AAS BS of Local Area BS class
and in table 7.8.5-3 for AAS BS of Medium Range BS class.

NOTE: If the above Test Requirement differs from the Minimum Requirement
then the Test Tolerance applied for this test is non-zero. The Test
Tolerance for this test is defined in clause 4.1.2 and the explanation
of how the Minimum Requirement has been relaxed by the Test Tolerance is
given in annex C.

8 Performance requirements
==========================

8.1 General
-----------

Performance requirements specify the ability of the AAS BS to correctly
demodulate signals in various conditions and configurations.

The demodulation requirements for an AAS BS are the same as non-AAS BS
demodulation requirements specified for:

*- Single RAT UTRA operation* in TS 25.104 \[9\] clause 8 for FDD
operation, and in TS 25.105 \[10\] clause 8 for TDD operation,

\- *Single RAT E-UTRA operation* in TS 36.104 \[11\], clauses 8.2 -- 8.4
(for PUSCH, PUCCH and PRACH) and 8.6 -- 8.7 (for subslot-PUSCH and
SPUCCH).

\- NR operation in TS 38.104 \[36\], clauses 8.2-8.5.

The test requirements for the AAS BS performance requirements have hence
been referenced from:

\- TS 25.141 \[18\] clause 8 for UTRA FDD,

\- TS 25.142 \[20\] clause 8 for UTRA TDD,

\- TS 36.141 \[17\] clauses 8.2 -- 8.4 (for PUSCH, PUCCH and PRACH) and
8.6 -- 8.7 (for subslot-PUSCH and SPUCCH) for E-UTRA, and

\- TS 38.104 \[36\] clauses 8.2 - 8.5 for NR.

Necessary amendments for the AAS BS architecture are made in this
clause.

8.2 Performance requirements for MSR
------------------------------------

For *single RAT UTRA operation* in FDD, the minimum performance
requirements are specified in clause 8.3.

For *single RAT UTRA operation* in TDD 1,28Mcps option, the minimum
performance requirements are specified in clause 8.4.

For *single RAT E-UTRA operation*, the minimum performance requirements
are specified in clause 8.5.

For *NR operation*, the minimum performance requirements are specified

8.3 Performance requirements for UTRA FDD
-----------------------------------------

### 8.3.1 Definition and applicability

Performance requirements for *single RAT UTRA operation* in FDD are
specified for the measurement channels defined in TS 25.104 \[2\]. The
requirements only apply to those measurement channels that are supported
by AAS BS. For FRC8 in TS 25.104 \[2\] the non E-DPCCH boosting and
E-DPCCH boosting requirement only apply for the option supported by the
AAS BS. The performance requirements for the high speed train scenarios
defined in TS 25.104 \[2\] and TS 25.105 \[3\] are optional.

Unless stated otherwise, performance requirements apply for a single
cell only. Performance requirements for an AAS BS supporting DC-HSUPA or
DB-DC-HSUPA are defined in terms of single carrier requirements. The
requirements in clause 8 shall be met with the transmitter unit(s)
associated with the *TAB connectors(s)* in the operating band ON.

NOTE: In normal operating conditions the *TAB connector(s)* are
configured to transmit and receive at the same time. The transmitter
unit(s) associated with the *TAB connectors* may be OFF for some of the
tests.

In the referred UTRA specifications and in this clause, the term BS with
RX diversity refers to performance requirements for two *demodulation
branches*, and BS without RX diversity refers to performance
requirements for one *demodulation branch*.

For AAS BS with RX diversity, only the BS performance requirements with
RX diversity apply, the required E~b~/N~0~ shall be applied separately
for each *demodulation branch*.

For AAS BS without RX diversity, only the BS performance requirements
without RX diversity apply. The required E~b~/N~0~ shall be applied for
each AAS BS *demodulation branch*.

The E~b~/N~0~ used is defined as:

Where:

is the received total energy of DPDCH, DPCCH, S-DPCCH, HS-DPCCH,
E-DPDCH, S-E-DPDCH, E-DPCCH and S-E-DPCCH per PN chip per *demodulation
branch* from all branches

is the total one-sided noise power spectral density due to all noise
sources

is the number of chips per frame

is the number of information bits in DTCH excluding CRC bits per frame

8.4 Performance requirements for UTRA TDD
-----------------------------------------

### 8.4.1 Definition and applicability

Performance requirements for *single RAT UTRA operation* in TDD are
specified for the measurement channels defined in TS 25.105 \[3\]. The
requirements only apply to those measurement channels that are supported
by AAS BS. The performance requirements for the high speed train
conditions defined in TS 25.105 \[3\] are optional. All Bit Error Ratio
(BER) and Block Error Rate (BLER) measurements shall be carried out
according to the general rules for statistical testing defined in
recommendation ITU-T O.153 \[34\] and annex F of TS 25.142 \[20\].

8.5 Performance requirements for E-UTRA
---------------------------------------

### 8.5.1 Definition and applicability

Performance requirements for *single RAT E-UTRA operation* are specified
for the fixed reference channels (FRC) and propagation conditions
defined in TS 36.104 \[8\] annex A and annex B, respectively. The
requirements only apply to those FRCs that are supported by the AAS BS.

Unless stated otherwise, performance requirements apply for a single
carrier only. Performance requirements for a *single RAT E-UTRA
operation* supporting carrier aggregation are defined in terms of single
carrier requirements. For FDD operation the requirements shall be met
with the transmitter unit(s) associated with the *TAB connectors(s)* in
the operating band ON.

NOTE: In normal operating conditions the *TAB connector(s)* in FDD
operation are configured to transmit and receive at the same time. The
transmitter unit(s) associated with the *TAB connectors* may be OFF for
some of the tests.

In the referred E-UTRA specification, the term \"RX antennas\" refers to
*demodulation branches* (i.e. not physical antennas).

The SNR used in this clause is specified based on a single carrier and
defined as:

SNR = S / N

Where:

S is the total signal energy in the subframe on a single *TAB
connector*.

N is the noise energy in a bandwidth corresponding to the transmission
bandwidth over the duration of a subframe.

For enhanced performance requirements type A in TS 36.104 \[4\], the
SINR used in this clause is specified based on a single carrier and
defined as:

Where:

is the total signal energy in the subframe on a single *TAB connector*.

is the summation of the received energy of the strongest interferers
explicitly defined in a test procedure plus the white noise energy *N*,
in a bandwidth corresponding to the transmission bandwidth over the
duration of a subframe on a single *TAB connector*. The respective

8.6 Performance requirements for NR
-----------------------------------

### 8.6.1 Definition and applicability

Conducted performance requirements specify the ability of the *BS type
1-H* to correctly demodulate signals in various conditions and
configurations. Conducted performance requirements are specified at the
*TAB connector(s)*.

Performance requirements for NR operation are specified for the fixed
reference channels (FRC) and propagation conditions defined in
TS 38.104 \[36\] annex A and annex G, respectively. The requirements
only apply to those FRCs that are supported by the NR BS.

Unless stated otherwise, performance requirements apply for a single
carrier only. Performance requirements for a NR operation supporting
carrier aggregation are defined in terms of single carrier requirements.

For FDD operation the requirements in clause 8 shall be met with the
transmitter units associated with *TAB connectors* in the *operating*
*band* turned ON.

NOTE: In normal operating conditions, transceivers in FDD operation are
configured to transmit and receive at the same time. The associated
transmitter unit(s) may be OFF for some of the tests as specified in
TS 38.141-1 \[37\].

In the referred NR specification, the term \"RX antennas\" refers to
*demodulation branches* (i.e. not physical antennas).

The SNR used in this clause is specified based on a single carrier and
defined as:

SNR = S / N

Where:

S is the total signal energy in the slot on a single *TAB connector*.

N is the noise energy in a bandwidth corresponding to the transmission
bandwidth over the duration of a slot on a single *TAB connector*.

### 8.6.2 Minimum Requirement

The minimum requirements for NR operation for each of the tests
specified in clauses 8.2 -- 8.4 (for PUSCH, PUCCH and PRACH) of
