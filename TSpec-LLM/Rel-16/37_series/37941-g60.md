 1 Scope
=======

The present document is the Technical Report for the Work Item on Over
The Air (OTA) Base Station (BS) testing.

This Technical Report covers background information of OTA testing
methods, measurement uncertainty and test tolerance values derivation
for the radiated conformance testing requirements. This Technical Report
covers radiated conformance testing requirements for the following BS
types:

*- Hybrid AAS BS* as specified in AAS BS radiated testing specification
TS 37.145-2 \[4\] for the following radio technologies:

\- *Hybrid AAS BS* in *single RAT UTRA operation*, TDD

\- *Hybrid AAS BS* in *single RAT UTRA operation*, FDD

\- *Hybrid AAS BS* in *single RAT E-UTRA operation*

\- *Hybrid AAS BS* in *MSR operation* implementing any of the above
RATs, including NR operation.

\- OTA AAS BS as specified in AAS BS radiated testing specification
TS 37.145-2 \[4\] for the following radio technologies:

\- OTA AAS BS in *single RAT UTRA operation*, FDD

\- OTA AAS BS in *single RAT E-UTRA operation*

\- OTA AAS BS in *MSR operation* implementing any of the above RATs,
and/or NR.

*- BS type 1-H* in *single RAT NR operation* in FR1, as specified in NR
BS radiated testing specification TS 38.141-2 \[6\],

*- BS type 1-O* in *single RAT NR operation* in FR1, as specified in NR
BS radiated testing specification TS 38.141-2 \[6\],

*- BS type 2-O* in *single RAT NR operation* in FR2, as specified in NR
BS radiated testing specification TS 38.141-2 \[6\].

Generic term \"BS\" is used to refer to any of these BS types, unless
otherwise stated.

This 3GPP external Technical Report consolidates the OTA measurement
related information originating from multiple AAS BS and NR BS internal
technical reports. This information is needed to supplement the BS
radiated testing specifications as a single, 3GPP external technical
report, such that the information can be referred to from external
specifications and bodies.

The NR BS specification refers to two frequency ranges, FR1 and FR2. The
AAS BS specification is only applicable for operating bands within FR1.
Thus, sections in this report referring to FR2 should be considered as
applicable to NR only.

4 Coordinate system
===================

OTA requirements are stated in terms of electromagnetic and spatial
parameters. The electromagnetic parameters are specified either in terms
of power (dBm) or field strength (dBμV/m). The spatial parameters are
specified in a Cartesian coordinate system (*x, y, z*) with an addition
of spherical coordinates (r, Θ, φ) for manufacturer declared parameters.

The orientation of these coordinates is depicted in the following
figures 4-1, 4-2 and 4-3. In figure 4-2, φ*** ***is the angle in the x/y
plane and it is between the x-axis and the projection of the vector onto
the x/y plane and is defined between -180° and +180°, inclusive. In
figure 4-3, the angle Θ is the angle between the projection of the
vector in the x/y plane and the vector and is defined between -90° and
+90°, inclusive.

A point in the spherical coordinates (r, Θ,*** ***φ) can be transformed
to Cartesian coordinate system (*x*, *y*, *z*) using the following
relationships:

The inverse transformation from Cartesian coordinate system (*x*, *y*,
*z*) to spherical coordinates (r, Θ,*** ***φ) is given by:

$$\phi = \ \left\{ \begin{matrix}
\arctan\frac{y}{x},\ x \geq 0\ \text{and}\ y \geq 0\ \ \ \ \ \  \\
\arctan\frac{y}{x} + \ 180^{{^\circ}},\ x < 0\ \text{and}\ y \geq 0 \\
\end{matrix} \right.\ $$

 $- \phi = \left\{ \begin{matrix}
\arctan\frac{y}{x},\ x \geq 0\ \text{and}\ y < 0\ \ \ \ \ \  \\
\arctan\frac{y}{x} - \ 180^{{^\circ}},\ x < 0\ \text{and}\ y < 0 \\
\end{matrix} \right.\ $ {#phi-left-beginmatrix-arctanfracyx-x-geq-0-textand-y-0-arctanfracyx---180circ-x-0-textand-y-0-endmatrix-right. .TT}
===================================================================

The representation of angles are described in figure 4-1, figure 4-2 and
figure 4-3.

Figure 4-1: Coordinate system representation in Cartesian coordinate
system

Figure 4-2: Representation of the φ angle (positive and negative values)

Figure 4-3: Representation of **Θ** angle (positive and negative values)

For the conformance requirements purposes in TS 37.145-2 \[4\] and
TS 38.141-2 \[6\] the manufacturer declares this coordinate system
reference point as a location in reference to an identifiable physical
feature of the BS enclosure. The manufacturer also declares the
orientation of this coordinate system in reference to an identifiable
physical feature of the BS enclosure.

Another conventions for spatial angles are also used and can be found in
definitions in IEEE Standard Test Procedures for Antennas \[7\] as shown
in figure 4-4, figure 4-5 and figure 4-6. Such a convention is used in
the TRP expression, e.g. as in clause 6.3. In figure 4-5, the angle φ is
defined for positive values only, that is, from 0 ° to 360 °, inclusive.
In figure 4-6, the angle θ corresponds to Θ in figure 4-3, but it is
important to note that θ is formed by the positive z-axis and the vector
and is defined between 0° and +180 °, inclusive.

coordinate system

5 Conformance testing aspects
=============================

5.1 Conformance testing framework
---------------------------------

Traditionally when calculating the MU for the conducted tests it was
sufficient to analyse a single test method, while for OTA tests the
chamber is an integral part of the test environment and it is important
to derive MU based on multiple chamber types and test methodologies. As
such a framework has been developed to estimate MU\'s for different test
methods and compare them equally.

The following 11 points have been agreed as a framework for developing
OTA test:

1\) Multiple test methods may exist for each requirement.

2\) Each test method will require its own test procedure.

3\) A single conformance requirement applies for each core requirement,
regardless of test procedure.

4\) Common maximum accepted test system uncertainty applies for all test
methods addressing the same test requirement. Test methods producing
significantly worse uncertainty than others at comparable cost should
not impact the common maximum accepted test system uncertainty
assessment.

5\) Common test tolerances apply for all test methods addressing the
same test requirement.

6\) A common way of establishing the uncertainty result from all test
methods\' individual budgets is established.

7\) A common method of making an uncertainty budget (not a common
uncertainty budget) is established.

8\) Establish budget format examples for each addressed test method in
the form of lists of uncertainty contributions. Contributions that may
be negligible with some BS and substantial with others should be in this
list. For each combination of measurement method and test parameter,
develop a list with measurement uncertainties.

9\) Describe potential OTA test methods relevant for testing radiated
requirements (e.g. directional, TRP, or co-location requirements). The
description requires information about the applicable test range
architectures and test procedures. Addressing each item in each
uncertainty budget with respect to the expected distribution of the
errors, the mechanism creating the error and how it interacts with
properties of the BS.

10\) Providing example uncertainty budgets will be useful in order to
demonstrate the way a budget should be defined and how calculating its
resulting measurement uncertainty is done, but the figures used in the
examples will clearly be only examples and not applicable in general.

11\) Each test instance may require an individual uncertainty budget
applicable for the combination of the test facility, the BS and the test
procedure and property tested. Here, the tester demonstrates that the
uncertainty requirement is fulfilled during the conformance testing.

The linking of core requirements via OTA test methods to conformance
requirements is depicted in figure 5.1-2.

Figure 5.1-2: Examples of OTA core requirement to test requirement
mapping

For *TRP requirements* the OTA conformance testing framework also
considers additional aspects of the TRP measurements as detailed in
clause 6.3. Depending on the TRP measurement procedure those additional
aspects are, e.g. TRP sampling grids, additional MU contributors, *TRP
summation error*, or ΔTRP correction factor, if applicable.

5.2 Uncertainty budget calculation principles
---------------------------------------------

Uncertainty contributions listed in clauses 9 -- 15 with descriptions in
annex A to C need to be calculated to provide an overall total
measurement uncertainty for each OTA test method for the accompanying
conformance requirement.

The uncertainty tables are presented with two stages:

\- Stage 1: the calibration of the absolute level of the BS measurement
results is performed by means of using a calibration antenna (for
example a standard gain horn) whose absolute gain is known at the
frequencies of measurement,

\- Stage 2: the actual measurement with the BS as either the transmitter
or receiver (depending on the considered requirement) is performed.

The final uncertainty budget should comprise of a minimum 5 headings:

1\) The uncertainty source,

2\) Uncertainty value,

3\) Distribution of the probability,

4\) Divisor based on distribution shape,

5\) Sensitivity coefficient *c~i~* and its calculated standard
uncertainty *u~i~* (based on uncertainty value, divisor and sensitivity
coefficient *c~i~*).

NOTE: All measurement uncertainty contributions are assumed independent.
Measurement uncertainty contributor\'s values in tables are given in log
scale.

The calculation of the uncertainty contribution is based on the ISO
Guide on Evaluation of measurement data in \[8\] to the expression of
uncertainty in measurement. Each individual uncertainty is expressed by
its standard deviation (termed as \'standard uncertainty\') and
represented by symbol *u~i~*.

The procedure for forming the uncertainty budget can be as follows:

1\) Compile lists of individual uncertainty contributions for the
requirement specific measurement, both in Stage 1 (i.e. Calibration
measurement) and Stage 2 (i.e. BS measurement).

2\) Determine the standard uncertainty of each contribution *u~i~* by:

a\) Determining the distribution of the uncertainty (i.e. Gaussian,
U-shaped, rectangular, or exponentially normal).

b\) Determining the maximum value of each uncertainty (unless the
distributions is Gaussian).

c\) Calculating the standard uncertainty by dividing the uncertainty by
![](media/image17.wmf){width="0.3055555555555556in"
height="0.19444444444444445in"} if the distribution is U-shaped, by 2 if
the distribution exponentially normal and by
![](media/image18.wmf){width="0.2013888888888889in"
height="0.2013888888888889in"} if the distribution is rectangular.

d\) Multiplying the standard uncertainty by the sensitivity coefficient
*c~i.~*

3\) Convert the units into decibel, if necessary.

4\) Combine all the standard uncertainties by the Root of the Sum of the
Squares (RSS) method.

5\) Combine the uncertainties in Stage 1 and Stage 2 into the combined
uncertainty *u~c~* also by the RSS method:

*𝑢* *𝑢*=*𝑈𝑐*,*𝐷𝑈𝑇* *𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡*2+*𝑈𝑐*,*𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑏𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒* *𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡*2

6\) Multiply the result of the combined uncertainty *u~c~* by an
expansion factor of 1.96 to derive expanded uncertainty *u~e~* at 95 %
confidence level:

*u~e~* = 1.96 *u~c~*

7\) For *TRP requirements* where multiple directional measurements have
been taken add the *TRP summation error* (SE) to the combined
uncertainty *u~c~* using RSS method.

${\text{Total}\ \text{Uncertainy}}_{\text{TRP}} = \sqrt{U_{u}^{2} + \text{SE}^{2}}$

The above procedure calls for forming a list of uncertainty contributors
in step 1, followed by an assessment of each in the following steps.
This process traditionally results in 2 tables, e.g. as captured in the
legacy technical reports in. The 1^st^ table consisting of an
uncertainty budget with a list of contributors, their associated UID and
reference to a full description. The 2^nd^ table carrying out the
uncertainty assessment of uncertainty contributions listed in the 1^st^
table.

In this report there are many tables so to keep the document manageable
the full documentation method is used just for a single requirement type
(i.e. EIRP accuracy, Normal test conditions in clause 9.2) in order to
demonstrate the process for all considered chamber types. For the all
the remaining requirements the same process is followed and the data in
the 2 tables is merged into a single one (e.g. as in table 9.3.2.3-1) in
order to save space in the report. In the merged table the UID column
contains the annex where the uncertainty contributor description is
given.

6 Measurement types
===================

6.1 Spatial definitions
-----------------------

Spatial definitions for classification of the OTA requirements were
introduced below. OTA transmitter requirements can be split into either:

1\. Directional requirements: The BS manufacturer declares beam(s) and
coverage ranges over which the beam can be steered. Directional
requirement type does not imply the requirement is defined only in one
direction as many directional requirements have a number of compliance
directions. It implies that the directional requirement applies to a
single direction at a time.

2\. *TRP requirements:* TRP is a requirement, which is defined as the
total power radiated by the BS in all radiation space.

3\. Co-location requirements: Co-location requirements are based on
assumption that the BS is co-located with another BS of the same base
station class. Co-location requirements ensure that both co-located
systems can operate with minimal degradation to each other.

NOTE: Co-location requirements are only applicable in FR1, i.e. for OTA
AAS BS, or for *BS type 1-O*.

6.2 Directional measurements
----------------------------

### 6.2.1 General

The test requirements of the BS directional requirements may be placed
on one or more manufacturer declared beam(s) that are intended for
cell-wide coverage.

Some example directional requirements are defined with respect to an
isotropic antenna in terms of EIRP and EIS. EIS is related to the power
density of a plane wave incident on the BS when the power level in the
receiver is at the sensitivity level.

### 6.2.2 Beam parameter definitions

A beam (of the antenna) is the main lobe of the *radiation pattern* of
an *antenna array* of the BS. A beam is created by means of a
superposition of the signals radiated from different parts of the
*antenna array*.

Each *beam direction pair* is associated with half-power contour of the
*beam centre direction* and a *beam peak direction*. The EIRP is
declared at the *beam peak direction*. The *beam centre direction* is
used for describing beam steering.

![](media/image19.emf){width="6.493055555555555in"
height="2.8680555555555554in"}

Figure 6.2.2-1: Example of *beam direction pair*

In figure 6.2.2-1 left sub-figure shows a symmetrical beam where *beam
centre direction* and *beam peak direction* are the same. In figure
6.2.2-1 right sub-figure shows an example of a beam with ripple where
the *beam centre direction* and the *beam peak direction* are different.

The number of declared BS beams is for the manufacturer to declare. Some
examples of declarations of beams are illustrated in a *directions
diagram* in figure 6.2.2-2.

![](media/image20.emf){width="6.6875in" height="3.4583333333333335in"}

Figure 6.2.2-2: Examples of BS beam declarations depicted in a
*directions diagram*

In figure 6.2.2-2 the shaded areas/points represent the declared EIRP
directions set, which may be continuous (top right, bottom right) or not
continuous (bottom left), or be restricted to just the points of maximum
steering (top left). The red coloured points represent the compliance
test points at which EIRP is declared. The maximum EIRP and its accuracy
are defined for the declared beams when activated individually on all
corresponding RE and the requirements are placed per individual beam.

The maximum radiated transmit power of the BS beam is the mean power
level measured at the declared *beam peak direction* at the RF channels
B (bottom), M (middle) and T (top) when configured for maximum EIRP
value for a specific BS beam of the supported frequency channels
declared by the manufacturer.

Another form of directional measurement is the *OTA sensitivity
directions declaration(s)* (OSDD) used for the receiver directional
requirements. OSDD is declared for OTA sensitivity requirement and
described in more details in clause 6.2.3.

### 6.2.3 OSDD

If an OSDD does not include a *receiver target redirection range*,
conformance testing is performed for the following five directions, as
depicted in the example in figure 6.2.3-1:

\- The *receiver target reference direction*.

\- The direction determined by the maximum φ value achievable inside the
*sensitivity RoAoA* maintaining the receiver target reference direction
Θ value.

\- The direction determined by the minimum φ value achievable inside the
*sensitivity RoAoA* maintaining the *receiver target reference
direction* Θ value.

\- The direction determined by the maximum Θ value achievable inside the
*sensitivity RoAoA* maintaining the *receiver target reference
direction* φ value.

\- The direction determined by the minimum Θ value achievable inside the
*sensitivity RoAoA* maintaining the *receiver target reference
direction* φ value.

The manufacturer declares the five directions for conformance testing.

Figure 6.2.3-1: OSDD without target redirection capability

In figure 6.2.3-1 a direction diagram shows a RoAoA without *receiver
target* redirection capability. The *receiver target reference
direction* and the extreme directions subject to conformance testing are
marked by red crosses.

If an OSDD includes a *receiver target redirection range*, conformance
testing is performed for the following five directions, as depicted in
the example in figure 6.2.3-2:

\- The *receiver target reference direction*.

\- The direction determined by the maximum φ value achievable inside the
*receiver target* redirection range maintaining the *receiver target
reference direction* Θ value.

\- The direction determined by the minimum φ value achievable inside the
*receiver target* redirection range maintaining the *receiver target
reference direction* Θ value.

\- The direction determined by the maximum Θ value achievable inside the
*receiver target* redirection range maintaining the *receiver target
reference direction* φ value.

\- The direction determined by the minimum Θ value achievable inside the
*receiver target* redirection range maintaining the *receiver target
reference direction* φ value.

The manufacturer declares the five directions for conformance testing,
the setting of the BS to achieve conformance at each of the conformance
test directions, and the resulting *sensitivity RoAoA* for each of these
settings.

Figure 6.2.3-2: OSDD with target redirection capability

In figure 6.2.3-2, a direction diagram is showing a *receiver target
redirection range* (with discrete settings for the *sensitivity RoAoA*).
The *receiver target reference direction* and the extreme directions
subject to conformance testing are marked by red crosses. The
*sensitivity RoAoA* for each conformance test setting is shown as
shaded. Note that each *sensitivity RoAoA* is exceptionally small
compared to the *receiver target redirection range*, for demonstration
purposes.

6.3 TRP measurement
-------------------

### 6.3.1 General

The TRP or the radiated power is the total power radiated by a BS. Due
to energy conservation, TRP is independent of the choice of test
distance.

TRP~Reference~ is defined as the integral of the BS\'s far field
*radiation pattern* over a spherical surface

,

where *U(θ, ϕ)* is the radiation intensity at each angle in watts per
Steradian.

In the far field, the radiation intensity can be also be expressed in
terms of power flux density

$\text{TRP}_{\text{Reference}} = ∯_{}^{}\underset{P_{D}}{\overset{\text{Re}\left( \overrightarrow{E} \times {\overrightarrow{H}}^{*} \right).\widehat{n}}{︸}}\text{dS}$

Where:

$\text{Re\ }\left( \overrightarrow{E} \times {\overrightarrow{H}}^{*} \right) =$
the time average of the Poynting vector (average power density) or the
power flux of the electromagnetic field, where $\overrightarrow{E}$ and
 $\overrightarrow{H}$ are effective values of the time-harmonic
electric- and magnetic-field intensities, respectively. Furthermore,
$\text{Re}$ denotes real part, $H^{*}$ denotes the complex conjugate of
$H$ and × is vector cross product.

$P_{D} = Re\ \left( \overrightarrow{E} \times {\overrightarrow{H}}^{*} \right).\widehat{n} =$
average power density in watts per square metre, which is a scalar.

$\widehat{n} =$ unit vector normal to the closed surface $S$.

$dS =$ infinitesimal area of the closed surface.

For practical reasons, a sphere of radius $r$ is a common choice for the
closed surface, but also other surfaces can be considered e.g. cylinder
and planar surface. The spherical coordinate system defined in
clause 4is assumed.

In the far field limit (i.e. $r \rightarrow \infty$), the
$\overrightarrow{E}(r,\theta,\phi)$ and
$\overrightarrow{H}(r,\theta,\phi)$ fields consist of the tangential
components (${\overrightarrow{E}}_{t}(r,\theta,\phi)$ and
${\overrightarrow{H}}_{t}(r,\theta,\phi)$), respectively) and the radial
components (${\overrightarrow{E}}_{r}\ $and ${\overrightarrow{H}}_{r}$)
are negligible, and, therefore,
$\left| {\overrightarrow{H}}_{t} \right| = \frac{\left| {\overrightarrow{E}}_{t} \right|}{\eta}$,
where $\eta$ is the intrinsic impedance of vacuum. Thus, the TRP
equation becomes

$\text{TRP}_{\text{Reference}} = \ \int_{\theta = 0}^{\pi}{\int_{\phi = 0}^{2\pi}{\text{Re}\left( {\overrightarrow{E}}_{t} \times {\overrightarrow{H}}_{t}^{*} \right)}.\widehat{n}r^{2}}\sin{\theta\text{dθ}\text{dϕ}}\  = \int_{\theta = 0}^{\pi}{\int_{\phi = 0}^{2\pi}\underset{P_{D}(r,\theta,\phi)}{\overset{\left| {\overrightarrow{E}}_{t} \right|\ \left| {\overrightarrow{H}}_{t}^{*} \right|}{︸}}}r^{2}\sin\theta\text{dθ}\text{dϕ}$

where
$P_{D}(r,\theta,\phi) = \frac{\left| {\overrightarrow{E}}_{t}(r,\theta,\phi) \right|^{2}}{\eta}$.

The radiation intensity in the far field region in watts per Steradian
is

$U\left( \theta,\phi \right) = r^{2}P_{D}\left( r,\theta,\phi \right)$

The power density can be expressed in terms of EIRP as

$P_{D}(r,\theta,\phi) = \frac{\text{EIRP}(\theta,\phi)}{4\pi r^{2}}$

and when r is large, radiation intensity is proportional to 1/r^2^ hence
in the far field region P~d~ \~ 1/r^2^ and P~d~ multiplied with r^2^
becomes roughly constant value. Thus the radiation intensity equation
can be defined as

$U\left( \theta,\phi \right) = \frac{\text{EIRP}(\theta,\phi)}{4\pi}$

Thus, the definite integral for TRP~Reference~ can be also expressed as

EIRP is defined only in the far- field. However, in some occasions the
power measurements can be performed at distances less than 2d^2^/λ (i.e.
the traditional approximate far-field distance boundary). In such cases
it is may be possible to measure power density in the radiative near-
field considering only the magnitude of the tangential part of E field
(i.e. $\left| E_{t}\left( r,\theta,\phi \right) \right|$) with an
acceptable level of accuracy as demonstrated in \[10\], where it is
presented that the TRP is well approximated by the integral of
$\left| E_{t} \right|^{2}/\eta$ over the same sphere.assuming far field
conditions. Thus TRP~Reference~ can be expressed as

As mentioned, for near-field measurements use the approximation where
$P_{D}\left( r,\theta,\phi \right) = \frac{\left| E_{t}\left( r,\theta,\phi \right) \right|^{2}}{\eta}$
and $\eta = \sqrt{\frac{\mu_{0}}{\varepsilon_{0}}} \approx 377\ \Omega$
(intrinsic impedance of vacuum).

The minimum distance between the measurement antenna and the smallest
sphere enclosing the BS must be at least 2λ and the test distance must
be at least the far-field distance of the measurement antenna when
considering the TRP measurements under far field conditions. More
details about the necessary conditions for accurate power density-based
measurements close to BS are included in annex F.

When measuring radiated power, at each measurement point, two partial
results for two orthogonal polarizations needs to be summed. These can
be the θ and ϕ polarizations or any pair of orthogonal polarizations.

The distribution of sampling points on the spherical surface depends on
the type of sampling grids applied, the frequency and the size of the
radiating source. In the following clauses, several spherical sampling
grids which can be applied to EIRP or power density measurements are
described.

### 6.3.2 TRP measurement procedures

#### 6.3.2.1 General

Different procedures can be used to evaluate the TRP estimate. These
procedures can provide either an *accurate* assessment or a controlled
*overestimate* of the TRP. The choice of methods is based also on the
available test setup, measurement equipment, and the measurement time.
This clause describes the methods which are suitable for each type of
requirements. Other relevant methods are not precluded. For each method,
the test purpose (accurate or overestimate) is pointed out. A summary of
TRP measurement procedures and their applicability to different OTA BS
requirements is shown in table 6.3.2.1-1.

In the following clauses the measurement procedures for different
parameters are described under the assumption of equal angle sampling.
Similar procedures can be also used with other types of spherical grids,
given that the proper reference steps $\Delta\theta_{\text{ref}}$ and
$\Delta\phi_{\text{ref}}$ are determined.

NOTE: OTA FR2 transmit ON/OFF power is excluded from the table although
the core requirement is specified as TRP because conformance is verified
through EIRP measurements.

The *TRP summation error* is based on a reasonable number of test
directions, for the reference steps please see figure 6.3.4.2-1. These
steps depend on antenna size and frequency and correspond to the minimum
beam width. It has been agreed that a reasonable trade-off between
accuracy and sampling is achieved when the SE is 0.75 dB for FR1 and
1.2 dB for FR2. For FR2, the beams are expected to be narrower than an
FR1 and hence the SE is higher. For the SE derivation, refer to
clause 6.3.6.

#### 6.3.2.2 Procedures for BS output power

##### 6.3.2.2.1 General

**Test purpose:** Accurate TRP assessment.

The radiation source is assumed to be limited to the antennas on the BS
and it\'s not necessary to take the dimensions of the whole BS into
account for calculations of the far-field distance and the reference
angular resolution. The test choices are as follows.

##### 6.3.2.2.2 Two cuts with pattern multiplication

Use this method when the antenna symmetries are compatible with pattern
multiplication, see clause 6.3.4.5 (orthogonal cuts grids). Following
steps are performed during the measurement:

1\. Calculate the reference angular steps as described in clause 6.3.4.2
(reference angular step criteria).

2\. Align the BS to allow for proper pattern multiplication. Measure
EIRP on two orthogonal cuts with steps smaller or equal to the reference
steps according to step 1.

3\. Apply pattern multiplication to extrapolate the two cuts data to
full-sphere.

4\. Apply numerical integration to obtain the TRP~Estimate~.

##### 6.3.2.2.3 Full sphere

Following steps are performed during the measurement:

1\. Calculate the reference angular steps as described in clause 6.3.4.2
(reference angular step criteria). Other methods for determining the
required angular steps are not precluded.

2\. Choose the angular steps smaller than or equal to the reference
angular steps.

3\. Measure EIRP values on a spherical grid according to clause 6.3.4.1
(spherical equal angle grids). Having the poles of the measurement grid
along the direction of the main beam shall be avoided.

**NOTE:** Spherical grids of clause 6.3.4.3 (spherical equal area
grids), clause 6.3.4.4 (spherical Fibonacci grids) and clause 6.3.4.6
(wave vector space sampling grids) can also be used with proper angular
steps.

4\. Apply suitable numerical integration to calculate the TRP~Estimate~.

##### 6.3.2.2.4 Beam-based directions

This method is only applicable if directivity of BS antenna is known for
the operating frequency. The peak EIRP of a beam is measured at the
*beam peak direction* within the *beam direction pair*. Following the
same approach, the peak EIRP of a beam can be obtained, which is used to
derive TRP~Estimate~ using directivity of BS antenna as follows:

$\text{TRP}_{\text{Estimate}} = \frac{\text{EIRP}_{\text{peak}}}{D_{\text{BS}}}$

, where D~BS~ is the directivity of BS.

For the case of OTA BS output power, the directivity (D~BSoutputpower~)
shall be defined as:

$D_{\text{BSOutputpower}} = \ \frac{P_{\text{rated},c,\text{EIRP}}}{P_{\text{rated},c,\text{TRP}}}$

#### 6.3.2.3 Procedures for SEM and OBUE

##### 6.3.2.3.1 General

**Test purpose:** Accurate or controlled overestimate of TRP.

The radiation source is limited to the antennas on the BS and it\'s not
necessary to take the dimension of the whole BS into account for
calculations of the far-field distance and the reference angular steps.
The test choices are as follows.

##### 6.3.2.3.2 Two cuts with pattern multiplication

Use the same procedure as in clause 6.3.2.2.2 (i.e. two cuts with
pattern multiplication for BS output power).

##### 6.3.2.3.3 Two or three cuts

Use this method when the cuts described in clause 6.3.4.5 (orthogonal
cuts grids) can be identified, but the pattern multiplication is not
applicable according to the requirements in clause 6.3.4.5. This method
will provide an overestimated value for TRP. Following steps are
performed during the measurement.

1\. Calculate the reference angular steps as in clause 6.3.4.2
(reference angular step criteria).

2\. Measure EIRP on two orthogonal cuts with angular steps smaller than
or equal to the reference steps according to step 3. Align the BS such
that the cardinal cuts are measured. See figure 6.3.4.5-1.

3\. Calculate the average EIRP in each cut and then the TRP~Estimate~
according to clause 6.3.4.5 (orthogonal cuts grids).

4\. If the TRP estimate is above the requirement limit, perform the
measurement on a third cut (See figure 6.3.4.5-1) and repeat step 3.

##### 6.3.2.3.4 Full sphere

Use the same procedure as in clause 6.3.2.2.3 for full sphere with
appropriate reference steps.

##### 6.3.2.3.5 Beam-based directions

This method only applicable if directivity of BS antenna is available
for the downlink operating band plus Δf~OBUE~ on either side of the band
edge. Refer to clause 6.3.2.2.4 for more details.

The pre-scan (refer to clause 6.3.2.5.2), peak (refer to
clause 6.3.2.5.3) and equal sector with peak average methods (refer to
clause 6.3.2.5.4) are possible options.

#### 6.3.2.4 Procedures for ACLR

##### 6.3.2.4.1 General

**Test purpose:** Accurate or controlled underestimate of ACLR.

The methods described in this clause are used for assessment of the TRP
values for ACLR. Depending on the method, the result can be accurate or
a controlled underestimate of the ACLR. The latter applies if the TRP of
the radiation in the adjacent band is overestimated. The radiation
source is limited to the antennas on the BS and it\'s not necessary to
take the dimension of the whole BS into account for calculations of the
far-field distance and the reference angular steps.

##### 6.3.2.4.2 TRP fraction method

Following steps are performed during the measurement.

1\. For the TRP of the desired signal TRP~d~ use a suitable method from
clause 6.3.2.2.

2\. For the TRP of the emission TRP~e~ use a method from clause 6.3.2.3.

3\. Evaluate the $ACLR = \frac{\text{TR}P_{d}}{\text{TR}P_{e}}$*.*

#### 6.3.2.5 Procedures for transmitter spurious emissions and EMC emissions

##### 6.3.2.5.1 General

**Test purpose of the procedures addressed in this clause is to
measure** accurate or controlled overestimate of TRP.

The methods described in this clause are used for assessment of the TRP
for spurious emissions. The methods are given in a sequence with
increasing accuracy, but also increasing measurement time. There is no
mandatory order, in which to use these methods nor all of the methods
should be used for evaluating TRP. Some of these methods can be skipped
if they are deemed not necessary, for instance, the pre-scan and peak
methods.

The radiation source is not limited to the antennas on the BS instead
the entire physical dimensions of the BS must be taken into account for
calculations of the reference angular steps, see clause 6.3.4.2
(reference angular step criteria). Note that full-sphere sampling using
reference angular steps is the only method that aims to provide an
accurate TRP.

When available, using a beam sweeping test signal with these methods can
reduce the test time and improve the uncertainty.

NOTE: As name of this clause captures both transmitter spurious
emissions and EMC emissions, it shall be clarified that in case of
radiated measurements of OTA AAS BS, *BS type 1-O* or *BS type 2-O*, the
RF radiated spurious emissions includes the EMC radiated emissions, as
RF radiated spurious emissions and EMC radiated emissions cannot be
distinguished in the OTA measurement setup.

##### 6.3.2.5.2 Pre-scan

Pre-scan is a fast measurement method, which is performed over the
entire spurious frequency range to identify spurious frequencies with
emission power levels above a threshold. Note, it is not necessary to do
pre-scan before executing the test methods in this clause, but it is
recommended. It is also not meant to provide an estimate of TRP. Hence,
other relevant test methods should be used for TRP estimation.

1\. The distance can be shorter than the intended measurement distance
between BS and the test antenna for evaluating TRP but should remain
fixed throughout the scanning process.

2\. Scan the surface around the BS.

3\. Rotate the measurement antenna to cover all polarizations of
emissions to detect the maximum emission.

4\. Record the list of spurious emission frequencies and corresponding
power levels, spatial positions of BS and test antenna polarization
where the maximum power levels occurred.

5\. For spurious frequencies with emission power levels more than 20 dB
below the specified limit in then these spurious frequencies are
considered compliant and no further measurements are required.

6\. For all the other spurious frequencies that do not meet the
criterion in step 5, further measurements are required.

##### 6.3.2.5.3 Peak method

This method is applicable when the pre-scan method indicates the
presence of emission peaks. The peak method can be skipped if there
exist no emission peaks. Further, the method does not provide a TRP
estimate instead the highest absolute EIRP is measured at each spurious
frequency identified in the pre-scan. If the absolute EIRP meets the
specified TRP limit, then it implies that the TRP estimate would meet
the limit too. As a result, it is not needed to perform further
measurement using the other methods.

1\. Find the direction of the peak emission EIRP or peak power density.

2\. Start with the spurious frequency that has the maximum power level
recorded during pre-scan.

3\. The BS and test antenna are oriented to the same position where the
maximum power level is recorded during the pre-scan.

NOTE: This set-up might not be applicable if pre-scan is performed in
near-field.

4\. BS and test antenna are moved around the position to identify and
measure the peak EIRP.

5\. If the peak EIRP for a spurious frequency is less than the specified
limit then no further measurements are required else use the methods
below to evaluate TRP estimates.

6\. Repeat steps 4 to 6 for the next strongest emission.

##### 6.3.2.5.4 Equal sector with peak average method

The equal sector with peak average method can be considered as an
extension to the peak method. It is performed on the list of spurious
frequencies which have not met the limit using the peak method. The
method takes into account several peak EIRPs of beams belonging to
different sectors of the sphere. TRP~Estimate~ is calculated as the
average of the peak EIRP in different sectors.

1\. The measurement distance is in the far field.

2\. The sphere is divided into *K* equal sectors. The total number of
sectors depend on the dimensions of BS. If the largest dimension is less
than 60 cm, then each sector is a half quadrant of 45 °. Other
techniques for determining the sector size are not precluded such as
using the angular step.

3\. For those spurious frequencies which need further measurements by
the peak method, start with the spurious frequency that has the highest
recorded power level.

4\. Perform steps 4 and 5 as in the peak method (see clause 6.3.2.5.3).

5\. Move to the next sector with next higher emissions recorded and
repeat step 4 until all sectors are covered.

6\. Calculate TRP estimate as
![](media/image26.png)![](media/image26.png), where
![](media/image27.png)![](media/image27.png) is in linear units.

7\. Repeat steps 4 and 5 for at least 7 spurious frequencies with the
next higher emission in descending order.

8\. If TRP estimate for each of the 8 spurious frequencies is less than
the specified limit then no further measurements are required else use
the other methods to evaluate TRP estimates.

##### 6.3.2.5.5 Two or three cuts with dense sampling

Following sequence can be used:

1\. Follow steps described in clause 6.3.2.3.3 and calculate the
TRP~Estimate~. Note that no alignment is needed for spurious emissions.

2\. Add the appropriate correction factor ΔTRP according to table
6.3.2.5.5-1 to ensure overestimation with 95% confidence.

3\. Compare the (TRP~Estimate~ + ΔTRP) to the limit.

4\. If the (TRP~Estimate~ + ΔTRP) is above the limit, perform the
measurement on an additional third cut (see figure 6.3.4.5-1) and repeat
steps 1 to 3.

Table 6.3.2.5.5-1: The correction factor for two or three cuts dense
sampling

                                Three cuts   Two cuts
  ----------------------------- ------------ ----------
  Correction factor ΔTRP (dB)   2.0          2.5

##### 6.3.2.5.6 Full sphere with sparse sampling

Sparse angular sampling with a correction factor can be used to save
measurement time. The only difference is in the used angular steps.
Following sequence can be used:

1\. Set the angular grid:

a\. Non-harmonic frequencies: choose the angular steps $\Delta\phi$ and
$\Delta\theta$ smaller than or equal to 15 °. Calculate the sparsity
factor (SF) as:

$\text{SF} = \max\left( \frac{\Delta\phi}{\Delta\phi_{\text{ref}}},\frac{\Delta\theta}{\Delta\theta_{\text{ref}}} \right)$

and the correction factor as:

$\frac{SF - 1}{SF_{\max} - 1}\ dB,$

b\. where $SF_{\max}$ *corresponds to 15 *° *angular step.* If the
sparsity factor is smaller than 1, the correction factor ΔTRP is 0 dB.
Harmonic frequencies with fixed beam test signal: choose the angular
steps smaller than or equal to the reference angular steps
$\Delta\phi_{\text{ref}}$ and $\Delta\theta_{\text{ref}}$. Correction
factor ΔTRP is 0 dB.

c\. Harmonic frequencies with beam sweeping test signal: set the angular
steps to 15 °. Correction factor is ΔTRP 0 dB.

2\. Measure EIRP (or power density multiplied by grid surface
$4\pi d^{2}$) on a spherical grid according to clause 10.8.2. Having the
poles of the measurement grid along the direction of the main beam shall
be avoided.

**NOTE:** Other spherical grids can also be used with proper angular
sampling.

3\. Apply a suitable numerical integration to calculate the
TRP~Estimate~.

4\. Add the appropriate correction factor ΔTRP according to step 1 to
ensure an overestimation with 95% confidence.

5\. Compare the (TRP~Estimate~ + ΔTRP) with the limit. If the
(TRP~Estimate~ + ΔTRP) is above the limit, choose a smaller angular step
and repeat steps 2 - 4. If the sparsity factor is less than one, no
significant improvement of accuracy is expected.

##### 6.3.2.5.7 Full sphere

Use the same procedure as in clause 6.3.2.2.3 for full sphere with
appropriate reference steps.

### 6.3.3 Angular alignment in TRP measurements

For the TRP test methods relying on finding EIRP peak measurements,
guidance on how to find the peak with acceptable accuracy is required.

The following test methods relies on finding peak EIRP:

1\. Beam-based direction (clause 6.3.2.2.4)

2\. Orthogonal cut grid (clause 6.3.4.5)

3\. Peak method (clause 6.3.2.5.3)

4\. Equal sector with peak average method (clause 6.3.2.5.4)

For the above procedures, **measuring maximum EIRP accurately is
critical to the accuracy of TRP estimates**. If the maximum value is not
accurately sampled, this will result in measurement errors. **In the
worst case, the measurement error is larger than the MU, which is not
acceptable. The measurement error is caused by angular misalignment
which is the difference (in degrees) between the actual and the measured
angular positions of the intended maximum EIRP. Figure 6.3.3-1 shows
a**n example of angular misalignment, where the measured EIRP is at an
angle equal to -2° while the actual angular position of the maximum EIRP
is at 0° in the *radiation pattern*. This results in an absolute
measurement error = $\left| maximum\ EIRP - measured\ EIRP \right|$ = 1
dB.

![](media/image28.emf){width="6.694444444444445in"
height="2.7916666666666665in"}

Figure 6.3.3-1: Angular misalignment

If the actual angular position of maximum EIRP is known (e.g., declared
by manufacturers), measurement errors due to angular misalignment can be
alleviated. However, if the actual angular position of maximum EIRP is
not known, then the angular interval used in searching for the maximum
EIRP employing the peak search method can contribute to the measurement
errors due to angular misalignment. The search is performed in the
proximity of the expected angular position of maximum EIRP (e.g., a
broadside *radiation pattern*). To determine the magnitude of the
measurement error caused by angular misalignment, the angular step size
can be expressed in terms of half-power beam width (HPBW) of test beams.
If the angular step size is set to HPBW, the absolute measurement error
can be as large as 3 dB. Table 6.3.3-1 summarizes the maximum absolute
measurement error versus different angular step sizes. The absolute
measurement errors were derived assuming a linear approximation between
the maximum EIRP and the 2 HPBW points as illustrated in figure 6.3.3-2.
The linear approximation gives us the worst-case scenario as can be
observed in figure 6.3.3-2.

![](media/image29.emf){width="6.5in" height="3.0694444444444446in"}

Figure 6.3.3-2: Linear approximation of measurement errors

Table 6.3.3-1: Sampling beam peak error due to misalignment error

  Angular misalignment        Beam peak misalignment error (dB)
  --------------------------- -----------------------------------
  HPBW                        3
  $$\frac{\text{HPBW}}{2}$$   1.5
  $$\frac{\text{HPBW}}{3}$$   1
  $$\frac{\text{HPBW}}{4}$$   0.75

Based on the measurement error in table 6.3.3-1, the measurement error
should be within the *TRP summation error* to ensure the angular
misalignment is not greater than $\frac{\text{HPBW}}{4}$ (for f ≤ 3 GHz
and 3 GHz \< f ≤ 6 GHz), and $\frac{\text{HPBW}}{3}$ (for 24.25 \< f ≤
29.5 GHz and 37 \< f ≤ 43.5 GHz). Note, there is a trade-off between
search time and angular misalignment (that is, the difference in actual
and measured angular positions of intended peak EIRP). Larger
misalignment for FR2 is reasonable since FR2 beams are in general
narrower than FR1.

For the orthogonal cut procedure in clauses 6.3.2.2.2 and 6.3.2.3.2
(i.e. two cuts with pattern multiplication), angular step size smaller
than the reference angular step may be desired as outlined in step 2. In
order to sample half power EIRP in addition to the maximum EIRP, the
angular step size may be set to $\frac{\text{HPBW}}{2}$, where HPBW is
the half-power beam width of the frequency under measurement.

### 6.3.4 TRP measurement grids

#### 6.3.4.1 Spherical equal angle grid

With the spherical equal angle grid, the grid spacing is uniform in
$\theta$ and $\phi$ directions. The range of $\theta$ angles from 0 to π
is divided into $N$ equally spaced subintervals and the range of $\phi$
angles from 0 to 2π is divided into $M$ equally spaced subintervals. The
width of each subinterval in the $\theta$- and $\phi$-angle is given as:

$\Delta\theta = \ \frac{\pi}{N}$ and
$\mathrm{\Delta}\phi = \ \frac{2\pi}{M}$

The total number of angular sampling points is equal to
$(N + 1) \times M$.

Let $n$ and $m$ be the indices used to denote the *n*^th^ $\theta$ and
*m*^th^ $\phi$ angles, respectively. In practice, discrete samples of
EIRP are measured at each sample point ($\theta_{n},\ \phi_{m}$) by
measuring its two orthogonally polarized components,
$\text{EIRP}_{p1}(\theta_{n},\phi_{m})$ and
$\text{EIRP}_{p2}(\theta_{n},\phi_{m})$. The EIRP sample are then used
to approximate the definite integral for TRP~Reference~ as the discrete
average sum of EIRP measured at different $\theta$ and $\phi$ angles.

$\text{TRP}_{\text{Estimate}} = \frac{\pi}{2NM}\sum_{n = 1}^{N - 1}{\sum_{m = 0}^{M - 1}{EIRP(\theta_{n},\phi_{m})\sin\theta_{n}}}$.

The above equation can be simplified considering $\sin\theta_{0}$ =
$\sin\theta_{N}$ = 0. Thus the total number of angular sampling points
is equal to (N -- 1)M.

NOTE: TRP~Estimate~ = TRP~Reference~ as $N$ and $M$ approach $\infty$.

There is a trade-off between the accuracy of the TRP~Estimate~ and the
total number of sampling points. A large number of sampling points leads
to long measurement time. Thus, it is important to achieve short
measurement time and fulfilling the minimum *TRP summation error.*
Clause 6.3.4.2 (i.e. reference angular step criteria) outlines the
criteria for determining the minimum number of sampling points to
characterize. Other means for set the number of sampling points are not
precluded.

One observation is that the equal angle grid points are not uniformly
distributed on the sphere surface, and many are clustered towards the
poles, as shown in figure 6.3.4.1-1.

![](media/image30.emf){width="4.5in" height="3.8333333333333335in"}

Figure 6.3.4.1-1: Spherical equal angle sampling grid

#### 6.3.4.2 Reference angular step criteria

For each frequency, the reference angular steps
$\Delta\phi_{\text{ref}}$ and $\Delta\theta_{\text{ref}},$ in degrees,
are calculated as in \[9\]:

,

where D and D~cyl~ are defined further down in this clause. This implies
a maximum angular step of 15 °. The upper limit for these reference
angular steps of 15 ° ensures a low *TRP summation error* when
$\lambda\ $is large compared to the BS dimensions.

The reference steps can be derived as follows. Consider two short
vertical current elements separated a distance *L* along the *z*-axis.
The EIRP pattern of this source is

$\text{EIRP}\left( \theta,\phi \right) = \sin^{2}{\theta\cos^{2}\left( k\cos\theta\frac{L}{2} \right)}$

Here, the element factor is $\sin^{2}\theta$ and
$\cos^{2}{(k\cos\theta\ L/2)}$ is the *array factor* contribution. To
calculate the TRP value correctly, an angular sampling of
$\Delta\theta_{\text{ref}} = \lambda/L$ is required, see figure
6.3.4.2-1. But a single $\phi$ is enough since the pattern is
$\phi$-independent (omni-directional).

Any current flowing on a line between the points
$\left( x,y,z \right) = (0,0, \pm L/2)$ will correspond to source
separations less than or equal to *L*. Hence its EIRP pattern will
correspond to the same angular resolution, i.e., the average value will
be correctly predicted using the same angular step.

![](media/image33.png){width="6.548611111111111in"
height="3.5347222222222223in"}

Figure 6.3.4.2-1: The average EIRP when using different angular steps
$\mathbf{\text{Δθ}}$ and the EIRP pattern of two short vertical current
elements separated a distance L=4, 8, 12, 16, and 32 wavelengths,
respectively. The dashed lines depict the reference angular step
$\frac{\mathbf{\lambda}}{\mathbf{L}}\mathbf{=}\frac{\mathbf{1}}{\mathbf{4}}\mathbf{,}\frac{\mathbf{1}}{\mathbf{8}}\mathbf{,}\frac{\mathbf{1}}{\mathbf{12}}\mathbf{,}\frac{\mathbf{1}}{\mathbf{16}}\mathbf{,}\frac{\mathbf{1}}{\mathbf{32}}$
radians for the used source separations

To proceed to more general sources two observations are useful:

1\) A rotation of a source will not change the required $\theta$
resolution, but the $\phi$ resolution must be set equal to the $\theta$
resolution.

2\) If the source distribution is stretched along the z-direction, the
$\phi$-resolution will not change.

Based on these two observations and the angular resolution of the line
source of length *L*, the following can be deduced.

1\) If the line source is tilted 90 ° down to the xy-plane, and then
arbitrarily rotated around the *z*-axis, a flat disc of diameter *L* is
generated. Based on observation 1, the angular resolution is
$\Delta\theta_{\text{ref}} = \Delta\phi_{\text{ref}} = \lambda/L$.

2\) If the disc is stretched a distance *h* along the z-axis (current
elements are translated parallel to the z-axis), then the
$\Delta\phi_{\text{ref}} = \lambda/L$ is unchanged, whereas the vertical
angular resolution increases to
${\Delta\theta}_{\text{ref}} = \lambda/\sqrt{L^{2} + h^{2}}$ to
encompass the largest possible source separation within the cylinder.

The final shape of the source enclosure is hence a cylinder of diameter
*L* and height *h*, and the angular steps required to get an accurate
EIRP average (TRP value) are

$\Delta\theta_{\text{ref}} = \frac{\lambda}{\sqrt{L^{2} + h^{2}}} = \frac{\lambda}{D}$
,
$\Delta\phi_{\text{ref}} = \frac{\lambda}{L} = \frac{\lambda}{D_{\text{cyl}}}$.

Here, $D$*D* is the diameter of the source enclosure, i.e., the diameter
of the smallest sphere enclosing all radiation sources, and D~cyl~ is
the diameter of the smallest *z*-directed circular cylinder that
encloses all sources.

Other methods for determining the reference angular steps are not
precluded.

NOTE: When sampling with the reference angular step, fine details of the
*radiation pattern* are maybe not captured but the estimated TRP value
is still accurate.

The spherical and cylindrical diameters are calculated as:

$D = \sqrt{d^{2} + w^{2} + h^{2\ \ \ \ }}\text{\ \ \ \ }$

$D_{\text{cyl}} = \sqrt{d^{2} + w^{2}}$

The radiation source can be the *antenna array* or even the whole BS,
depending on the emissions to consider. This is further explained in
clause 6.3.2.

Some basic definitions and relations are given here for readability.

Similar to Nyquist sampling in the time domain signal, the Rayleigh
resolution for spatial domain signal to avoid the aliasing can be
derived as:

![](media/image38.wmf){width="3.201388888888889in"
height="0.2916666666666667in"}

where *d* is the separation distance between antenna elements and *m* is
the number of antenna elements. If BS is mounted along the y-z plane as
shown in figure 6.3.4.2-3, based on the above considerations on the
Rayleigh resolution for spatial domain signal, then subinterval in the φ
and θ in degrees angle is calculated as:

$\Delta\theta_{\text{ref}} = min(\frac{180^{\circ}}{\pi}\arcsin\frac{\lambda}{D_{Z}},\ 15^{\circ}\ )$

${\Delta\phi}_{\text{ref}} = \min\left( \frac{180^{\circ}}{\text{\ π}}\arcsin\frac{\lambda}{D_{Y}}\ ,\ 15^{\circ} \right)$

Where *D~y\ ~*is length of radiating part of the BS along y-axis, *D~z~*
is length of radiated part of the BS along the z-axis and *λ* is
wavelength for the measured frequency. Arcsine is in radians.

Figure 6.3.4.2-3: Spherical coordinate for OTA conformance testing of BS

In the NR coexistence study, it was assumed that antenna configuration
for wide area BS is 8x16 supporting two orthogonal polarizations. If BS
mounted along y/z plane with antenna configuration 16x8 where 16 columns
are assumed along the y-axis and 8 rows are assumed along the z-axis.
Antenna elements are uniformly distributed with separation distance λ/2,
therefore aperture size *D~y~ ≈ 8λ* and *D~z~ ≈ 4λ*. The uniform
sampling in the spherical coordinate for this approach is demonstrated
in the figure 6.3.4.2-4.

For a wanted signal, the reference angular steps are approximately equal
to the beamwidth (in degrees) of the main beam.

$\text{FNBW}$$\text{FNBW}$

where BeW~φ~ and BeW~θ~ are the *beamwidth* of the wanted signal in the
φ-axis and θ-axis, respectively; FNBW~φ~ and FNBW~θ~ are the first null
beamwidth of the wanted signal in the φ-axis and θ-axis, respectively.

Using *beamwidth* of the wanted signal, the reference angular steps for
each frequency within the *downlink operating* *band* including Δf~OBUE~
can be expressed as follows:

$\text{FNBW}$$\text{FNBW}$where λ~o~ is the wavelength of the wanted
signal, and BeW~φ~ and BeW~θ~ are the *beamwidth* in the φ-axis and
θ-axis, respectively.

For the OTA BS radiated transmit power requirement, beamwidths at five
different directions is declared by manufacturers. The declared
beamwidth may be used to set BeW~φ~ and BeW~θ~ in the above equations
provided the same beam is applied to test in-band *TRP requirements*. If
the The numerical singularity at of a test beam is not declared, then
the beamwidth can be obtained through measurements following the same
procedure as the BS radiated transmit power requirement prior to TRP
measurements.

In addition, the beamwidth of the wanted signal can be used to determine
the physical dimensions of a radiation source as follows:

#### 6.3.4.3 Spherical equal area grids

With the spherical equal area sampling grid, the spherical surface is
partitioned into $N$ equal area regions. Let *n* be the index for the
*n*th region and there is one point ($\theta_{n},\phi_{n}$) located in
the centre of each region. The definite integral for TRP~Reference~ can
be approximated as:

$\text{TRP}_{\text{Estimate}} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n = 1}^{N}{EIRP(\theta_{n},\phi_{n})}$

The total number angular sampling points is $N$. Unlike the spherical
equal angle grid, the TRP~Estimate~ equation is not weighted by
$\text{sin\ θ}$. As shown in figure 6.3.4.3-1, the equal area grid
points are distributed uniformly on the sphere but the pattern of
$\theta$ and $\phi$ angles is irregular.

One possible way to estimate $N$ is as follows:

where $\Delta\theta_{\text{ref}}$ and ${\Delta\phi}_{\text{ref}}$ are
defined in clause 6.3.4.2. Other methods are possible and not precluded.

Figure 6.3.4.3-1: Spherical equal area sampling grid

#### 6.3.4.4 Spherical Fibonacci grids

The Fibonacci grid points are arranged along a generative spiral on the
spherical surface. Similar to the equal area sampling grid, the
Fibonacci grid generates points that are uniformly spaced in an
isotropic way. Assume there are $I$ points in the Fibonacci sampling
grid, then the definite integral for TRP~Reference~ can be approximated
as:

$\text{TRP}_{\text{Estimate}} = \frac{1}{I}\sum_{i = 0}^{I - 1}{EIRP(\theta_{i},\phi_{i})}$

where *i* = 0 .. $I - 1$

$\theta_{i} = \cos^{- 1}\left( 1 - \frac{2i + 1}{I} \right)$ and

$\phi_{i} = \frac{2\text{πi}}{\Psi}$,

where $\Psi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$

The total number of angular sampling points is *I*, which can be
estimated in a similar manner as in clause 6.3.4.3. Like the spherical
equal area grid, the TRP~Estimate~ equation is not weighted by
$\text{sin\ θ}$.

#### 6.3.4.5 Orthogonal cuts grids

Compared to the TX spurious emissions the OBUE emissions and ACLR are
likely to experience the similar beamforming pattern as for the wanted
signal. Due to this reason, it is easily predictable where the maximum
of the emissions is going to be, hence the possibility to enhance the
measurement method to achieve better accuracy. Here we choose to apply
the pattern multiplication method \[10\].

In this method, at least two cuts (default) shall be used, an optional
third cut can be added if needed. The alignment of the cuts must be
along the symmetry planes of the *antenna array*. Note that theta
reference steps apply to the vertical cuts and phi reference steps to
the horizontal cuts.

The first mandatory cut is a horizontal cut passing through the peak
direction of the main beam.

The second mandatory is a vertical cut passing through the peak
direction of the main beam.

Using the data from these two mandatory cuts, a conditional pattern
multiplication can be used.

The third optional cut is a vertical cut orthogonal to the first and the
second cut.

Once the number and the orientation of the cuts are decided, the total
EIRP is measured on the orthogonal cuts and the TRP is then calculated
as follows: First the contributions from each cut is calculated as:

$\text{EIRP}_{av,cut - n} = \frac{1}{P}\sum_{j = 1}^{P}{EIRP(j)}$

where P is the number of sampling points. The final contribution for all
cuts is calculated as:

$\text{TRP}_{\text{Estimate}} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n = 1}^{N}\text{EIRP}_{av,cut - n}$

**where N is the number of cuts**. Note that when orthogonal cuts are
measured, the intersection points are measured multiple times and the
repeated values can be removed from the samples before averaging.

Figure 6.3.4.5-1: Example of orthogonal cuts geometry when the main lobe
points along the x-axis. Two mandatory cuts grid (left) and the optional
added third cut (right). The first two cuts are generated by rotating
the BS around its z-axis and y-axis, respectively, and the optional
third cut is generated by rotating the BS around its x-axis

Two cuts cut data gives a conservative TRP estimate (an overestimation
of the real TRP). Through pattern multiplication a less conservative
estimate is obtained, based on the calculation of the antenna *array
factor* as a product of two terms, corresponding to the two cuts.

The following conditions for being able to apply pattern multiplication
method are mandatory:

i\. The vertical cut (and the main beam) is in the $\text{xz}$-plane

ii\. The frequency of the emission is within the downlink operating
band.

iii\. The bandwidth of the emission is the same as the bandwidth of the
in-band modulated signal

iv\. The emission appears/disappears when the TX power is turned on/off.

v\. The *antenna arrays* of the BS

1\. Have rectangular grids of antenna element positions

2\. Have symmetry planes that are vertical and horizontal.

3\. Have parallel antenna planes

The *antenna array* is here assumed to be placed in the yz-plane. The
pattern multiplication is performed in uv-coordinates and the data in
the two cuts are denoted EIRP~cut1~(φ) at $\theta = \theta_{H}\ $and a
vertical cut with data EIRP~cut2~($\theta$) at $\phi = 0$. The data is
split in two parts corresponding to the forward and backward hemisphere.
The uv-coordinates are the projections of the angular directions onto
the antenna plane, here the yz-plane. Using the spherical coordinates as
depicted in figure 6.3.4.2-2 the u and v coordinates are defined as:

$\left\{ \begin{matrix}
u = \sin{\theta\sin\phi} \\
v = \cos\theta \\
\end{matrix} \right.\ $

Note that only the data on the coordinate axes are measured, and hence
only the data$\ \text{EIRP}cut1\left( u \right)\ $EIPR~cut1~(*u*) for
$v_{H} = \cos\theta_{H}$ (the horizontal cut) and EIRP~cut2~(*v*) for
$u = 0$ (the vertical cut) are known. Moreover, only the points in the
circular disc $u^{2} + v^{2} \leq \ 1$ , a.k.a. the visible region,
contribute to the TRP.

The pattern multiplication is used to calculate power density values
outside the two cardinal cuts as:

$\text{EIRP}\left( u,v \right) = \frac{\text{EIRP}_{cut1}\left( u \right)\text{EIRP}_{cut2}\left( v \right)}{\text{EIRP}\left( 0,v_{H} \right)}$

In Figure 6.3.4.5-2, the case where $v_{H} = 0$ is illustrated.

![](media/image55.jpeg){width="4.152777777777778in"
height="3.4305555555555554in"}

Figure 6.3.4.5-2: Example of pattern multiplication

The pattern multiplication is applied separately for the forward (fwd)
and backward (bwd) hemisphere. The TRP is then calculated as

$\text{TRP} = \frac{1}{4\pi}\left\lbrack \iint_{\text{fwd}}^{}{\text{EIRP}_{\text{fwd}}\left( u,v \right)\frac{dudv}{\sqrt{1 - u^{2} - v^{2}}} +}\iint_{\text{bwd}}^{}{\text{EIRP}_{\text{bwd}}\left( u,v \right)\frac{dudv}{\sqrt{1 - u^{2} - v^{2}}}} \right\rbrack$

NOTE: The numerical singularity at $u^{2} + v^{2} = 1$ must be treated
with care, e.g. by changing the coordinate system to polar as in \[10\].

#### 6.3.4.6 Wave vector space sampling grid

Similar as Rayleigh sampling approach, BS is placed on the yz plane in
the spherical coordinate and normal vector of BS is pointing along the
x-axis as shown in figure 6.3.4.2-2. The angle φ and θ represent azimuth
and elevation respectively, *u* and *v* represent the projection of
normalized wave vector on y-axis and z-axis.

According to the relationship between the normalized wave vector and
spherical coordinate, the wave vector can be represented as following:

$u = \sin\left( \theta \right)\sin\left( \phi \right),\ v = cos(\theta)$

TRP is defined in the spherical coordinate as following:

![](media/image56.wmf){width="2.3958333333333335in"
height="0.3958333333333333in"}

As TRP is defined in the wave vector coordinate, therefore TRP
definition should be revised accordingly in the corresponding
coordinate. For the TRP definition in normalized wave vector space,
according to the 2D Jacobian transformation, the above equation could be
adjusted as following, namely:

$dudv = \left| \frac{\partial\left( u,v \right)}{\partial\left( \theta,\phi \right)} \right|d\theta d\phi = \sin^{2}{\theta\left| \cos\phi \right|d\theta d\phi}$

Based on the above two equations, then we could get

$\text{TRP} = \frac{1}{4\pi}\iint_{\text{fwd}}^{}{\frac{\text{EIRP}\left( \theta,\phi \right)}{\sin\theta\left| \cos\phi \right|}dudv} + \frac{1}{4\pi}\iint_{\text{bwd}}^{}{\frac{\text{EIRP}\left( \theta,\phi \right)}{\sin\theta\left| \cos\phi \right|}dudv}$

where relationship between (θ,φ) and (*u*,*v* )is demonstrated in the
equation before. Similar as discrete sampling process, the above
equation is approximated in the far-field region as the sum of the total
EIRP at a number of discrete directions as follows:

$\text{TRP} = \frac{{\Delta u}_{\text{grid}}\Delta v_{\text{grid}}}{4\pi}\left( \sum_{\begin{matrix}
u^{2} + v^{2} < 1 \\
\cos\phi > 0 \\
\end{matrix}}^{}{\frac{\text{EIRP}\left( \theta_{n},\phi_{m,n} \right)}{\sin\theta_{n}\left| \cos\phi_{m,n} \right|}\ } + \sum_{\begin{matrix}
u^{2} + v^{2} < 1 \\
\cos\phi < 0 \\
\end{matrix}}^{}{\frac{\text{EIRP}\left( \theta_{n},\phi_{m,n} \right)}{\sin\theta_{n}\left| \cos\phi_{m,n} \right|}\ } \right)$

The above considerations could be applied for both polarization.

Uniform sampling in the wave vector coordinate as shown in figure
6.3.4.6-1:

\- Rayleigh resolution in y-axis:
$\Delta u_{\text{grid}} = \frac{\lambda}{D_{y}}$

\- Rayleigh resolution in z-axis:
$\Delta v_{\text{grid}} = \frac{\lambda}{D_{z}}$

Where *D~y~* is length of radiating parts of BS along y-axis, *D~z~* is
length of radiating parts of BS along the z-axis.

Based on the uniform sampling grid on the yz plane, we could get the
sampling point ($u_{m}\ $, $v_{n}$). In addition, according to the
transformation between ($u_{m}$,$\text{\ v}_{n}$) and (φ, θ), then
azimuth and elevation (φ~m,n~, θ~n~) in the spherical coordinate could
be derived correspondingly as shown in figure 6.3.4.6-2. Based on the
(φ~m,n~, θ~n~) in the spherical coordinate, EIRP on the spherical
coordinate could be measured.

### 6.3.5 Aspects related to measurement of OTA unwanted emission

#### 6.3.5.1 Test range

Test of OTA unwanted emission required an OTA test environment, capable
of measuring TRP emission under the condition that the test object is
radiating the wanted signal at full power. To handle high RF power from
the test object required careful planning of the setup (e.g. test
personal and test equipment cannot be placed inside the test chamber
during the test). To avoid measurement chamber influence and external
interferer on the test result, use of a shielded anechoic chamber is
preferable. A positioner is used to move the test object according to
selected measurement grid for a proper TRP measurement. The emission is
measured at the output RF port of the measurement antenna placed at a
suitable test distance. In figure 6.3.5.1-1, a principle test
environment suitable for OTA unwanted emission is depicted.

![](media/image59.png){width="3.5347222222222223in"
height="2.5416666666666665in"}

Figure 6.3.5.1-1: Principle test environment

The test environment may differ between OTA unwanted emission
requirements; OTA ACLR, OTA OBUE and OTA spurious emission. For OTA
spurious emission, a test environment similar to the one used for EMC
radiated emission or a Shielded Indoor Anechoic Chamber (IAC) can be
used. For OTA unwanted emission requirements defined within the in-band
region other test environments could be considered e.g. CATR or IAC.

A band stop filter is needed to protect the measurement receiver from
the wanted signal, achieving dynamic range for the emission to be
measured with acceptable measurement uncertainty.

#### 6.3.5.2 Measurement distance

The measurement distance is the distance between the test object and the
measurement antenna (or probe antenna). The measurement distance is
usually determined by the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) required for the
measurement receiver to detect the emission level with acceptable
measurement uncertainty. Unlike, EIRP, *total radiated power* (TRP) is
not exclusively a far-field parameter. TRP is defined as the *total
radiated power* radiated by an object, regardless to the distance. Since
emission power levels tends to be low, it is essential to conserve the
path-loss in the test setup, by minimizing the measurement distance.
Another aspect is the for the lower limit (i.e. 30 MHz) the far-field
criteria would result in unpractical measurement distances for OTA
testing. Further guidance on near-field testing can be found in annex F.

#### 6.3.5.3 Sampling grid selection

A dense full-sphere grid, i.e. using reference steps, will result in a
very large number of measurement points to extract TRP per frequency,
while a sparse grid requires a few measurements. The selection of grid
and corresponding sampling resolution determines the measurement
uncertainty error contribution related to sampling the radiating power
over the sphere. Determining proper sampling grids for emission,
assumptions of the spatial distribution of emission should be
considered. If it can be established that the emission is radiating in
all directions, the sample grid resolution can be significantly reduced.

The ability of direct emission in certain direction is set by the
physical size of BS, number of radiating sources and correlation
properties. For low frequencies, where D \<\< λ, it is reasonable to
believe that the radiated emission will be omni-directional, while for
the case where D \>\> λ, there is a potential risk that emission leaking
through the encapsulation or the antenna aperture can be directed in a
certain direction. Therefore, the process to determine the sampling grid
and corresponding resolution needs to include the frequency as one
parameter. Consequently, a concept with a fixed sampling grid over the
whole spurious frequency domain is not suitable to balance measurement
uncertainty with test time.

### 6.3.6 TRP summation error

In practice, discrete samples of EIRP or power density are measured at
different directions $(\theta,\phi)$ over the entire sphere, which are
used to numerically approximate the surface TRP~Reference~ integral. The
obtained value, TRP~Estimate~, is an approximation of TRP~Reference~ and
the difference between them is defined as the *TRP summation error* (SE)
which is

SE = \| TRP~Estimate~ -- TRP~reference~ \| (in dB)

The SE is the error caused by the numerical integration of measured
values on the grid to obtain TRP~Estimate~, given that the number of
test points correspond to the reference angular steps, which are in turn
dependent on antenna size and frequency, as described in clause 6.3.4. A
reasonable trade-off between accuracy and sampling time is achieved when
the SE = 0.75 dB.

6.4 Co-location measurements
----------------------------

### 6.4.1 General

Co-location measurements are required for the OTA co-location
requirements which are based on assuming the BS is co-located with
another BS of the same base station class. They ensure that both
co-located systems can operate with minimal degradation to each other.

Co-location requirements are specified as power levels into or out of
the conducted interface of the *co-location reference antenna*. For
conformance testing the requirements are translated to the input or
output of a *co-location test antenna* (CLTA).

CLTA is a practical passive antenna that is used for conformance testing
of the co-location requirements and is based on the definition of the
*co-location reference antenna*. Basic principle of the CLTA are
outlines in clause 6.4.2. For more details on the *co-location test
antenna* characteristics, refer to TS 37.145-2 \[4\] clause 4.15.2.2, or
TS 38.141-2 \[6\] clause 4.12.2.2. The CLTA is suitable for testing BS
implemented with a planar *antenna array*.

The alignment between the BS under test and the *co-location test
antenna* is depicted in figure 6.4.1-1. For more details on the
*co-location test antenna* alignment and test arrangement, refer to
TS 37.145-2 \[4\] clause 4.15.2.3, or TS 38.141-2 \[6\] clause 4.12.2.3.
The same physical alignment applies to in-band and out-of-band
co-location requirements.

Co-location requirements are not applicable to FR2.

![](media/image60.emf){width="6.6875in" height="4.5625in"}

Figure 6.4.1-1: Alignment of BS and CLTA

### 6.4.2 Co-location test antenna

The *co-location test antenna* is a practical passive antenna based on
the definition of the *co-location reference antenna,* and it is used
for conformance testing of the co-location requirements. Thus the CLTA
should be within a certain tolerance of the co-location reference
antenna definition, so that commonly available passive BS antennas can
be used to test the co-location requirements without having to use a
large number of test antennas and without having to design specialized
*co-location test antennas*.

For example, where the co-location reference antenna definition
specifies that the *co-location reference antenna*, should be a single
column passive antenna which has the same vertical radiating dimension
(h) as the composite antenna of BS, this would be very restrictive when
selecting a test antenna. Hence the CLTA should be within a certain
tolerance for the vertical radiating dimension (h) such that a suitable
practical BS antenna can be found for each BS.

The CLTA is hence defined as follows:

\- The CLTA is a single column passive antenna which has a vertical
radiating dimension (h) which is equal to the vertical radiating
dimension of the BS composite antenna ±30 %.

\- For in-band requirements, the CLTA supports the same frequency range
and polarizations as the BS composite antenna.

\- For out-of-band co-location requirements, the half power vertical
beamwidth of the CLTA equals the narrowest declared vertical beamwidth
±3 °.

\- The polarization should match the in-band CLTA polarization.

\- The CLTA has a horizontal half-power beamwidth of 65 ° ± 10 °.

\- The front faces of the BS and the CLTA need to be aligned in a common
plane perpendicular to the mechanical bore-sight direction.

\- The centre of the vertical radiating regions of the CLTA and the BS
composite antenna need to be aligned.

### 6.4.3 Standard test antenna

Co-location requirements may also be tested with a standardised test
antenna such as a dipole. This has a number of advantages:

\- Standard test antennas are easily available and easier to specify.

\- Repeatability between different conformance testing runs will be
greater.

\- Using standard test antennas, fewer antennas will be required for
conformance testing.

\- A standard test antenna can have higher gain in the direction of the
BS than a CLTA, so that signal levels can be higher relative to the
noise floor in emission measurements and lower test levels can be used
in interference measurements.

In order to test with a standard test antenna, the translation between
measured power levels in the standard test antenna and the *co-location
reference antenna* must be shown. The method for translating the power
levels in the *co-location reference antenna* to the standard test
antenna and vice versa is not covered by the present release of this
technical report.

Directional requirements are to be met over one of two defined
directions sets, with each direction set being declared:

\- The *OTA coverage range*: range of directions over which *directional
requirements* associated with BS-UE communication are intended such as
modulation quality, TAE and frequency error. It can be regarded as the
range of directions which define the cell coverage. There is only one
*OTA coverage range* per BS.

\- The *OTA peak directions set*: intended for *directional
requirements* which are intended for the centre of the beam for example
EIRP accuracy. The *OTA peak directions set* must always be within the
*OTA coverage range*. There may be more than one *OTA peak directions
set* declared, the declarations cover the range of directions which a
beam may be steered. As the BS may generate more than one type of beam
with different beam widths and different steering capabilities the
declaration allows for multiple *OTA peak direction sets* to be
declared. The minimum set of declarations covers the beams with the
narrowest and the widest beam widths.

7 OTA measurement systems
=========================

7.1 General
-----------

All the measurement systems are described for measurement in Normal test
conditions, unless otherwise stated.

7.2 Indoor Anechoic Chamber
---------------------------

### 7.2.1 Measurement system description, Normal test conditions

This method measures the EIRP in an anechoic chamber with the separation
between the manufacturer declared coordinate system reference point of
the BS and the phase centre of the receiving antenna of no less than
2D^2^/λ, where D is the largest dimension of the antenna of BS and λ is
the wavelength. The measurement system setup is as depicted in figure
7.2.1-1 for TX requirements, and in figure 7.2.1-2 for RX requirements.

### 7.2.2 Measurement system description, Extreme test conditions

This method places the BS under test inside a RF transparent
environmentally sealed enclosure so that the BS temperature can be
controlled whilst the result of the OTA chamber facility is at nominal
temperature.

The separation between the manufacturer declared coordinate system
reference point of the BS and the phase centre of the receiving antenna
of no less than 2D^2^/λ, where D is the largest dimension of the antenna
of BS and λ is the wavelength. The measurement system setup is as
depicted in figure 7.2.2-1.

test conditions

### 7.2.3 Test method limitations

The maximum size of the BS is a chamber restriction that would affect
the quality of the quiet zone. For larger BS sizes larger size chambers
should be considered such that the uncertainty of the quiet zone is
taken into account.

7.3 Compact Antenna Test Range
------------------------------

### 7.3.1 Measurement system description, Normal test conditions

In case of TX requirements measurement, the Compact Antenna Test Range
(CATR) uses the BS which radiates a wavefront to a range antenna
reflector which will then collimate the radiated spherical wavefront
into a feed antenna. The sufficient separation between the BS and the
receiver (feed antenna shown in figure 7.3.1-1) so that the emanating
spherical wave reaches nearly plane phase fronts from transmitter to
receiver. The BS transmits a wavefront that will illuminate the range
antenna reflector, which will then reflect the transmitted energy into
the feed antenna. The range feed antenna is connected to a vector
network analyzer or other equivalent test equipment.

Figure 7.3.1-1: CATR measurement system setup, TX requirements

In case of RX requirements, the CATR uses the feed antenna which
radiates a spherical wavefront to a range reflector antenna which will
then collimate the radiated spherical wavefront to the BS. There is
sufficient separation between the BS and the transmitter (feed antenna
shown in figure 7.3.1-2) so that the emanating spherical wave reaches
nearly plane phase fronts from transmitter to receiver. The feed antenna
transmits a wavefront that will illuminate the range antenna reflector,
which will then reflect the transmitted energy towards the BS.

### 7.3.2 Measurement system description, Extreme test conditions

This method places the BS under test inside a RF transparent
environmentally sealed enclosure so that the BS temperature can be
controlled whilst the result of the OTA chamber facility is at nominal
temperature.

The Compact Antenna Test Range (CATR) uses the BS which radiates a wave
front to a range antenna reflector which will then collimate the
radiated spherical wave front into a feed antenna. The sufficient
separation between the BS and the receiver (feed antenna shown in figure
7.3.2-1) so that the emanating spherical wave reaches nearly plane phase
fronts from transmitter to receiver. The BS transmits a wave front that
will illuminate the range antenna reflector, which will then reflect the
transmitted energy into the feed antenna. The range feed antenna is
connected to a vector network analyzer or other equivalent test
equipment.

For the environmental control of the BS required to produce the extreme
temperature environment the BS under test is placed inside a RF
transparent environmentally sealed enclosure so that the BS temperature
can be controlled whilst the result of the OTA chamber facility is at
nominal temperature.

Figure 7.3.2-1: CATR measurement system setup for EIRP accuracy in
Extreme test conditions

### 7.3.3 Test method limitations

The maximum size of the BS is a chamber restriction that would affect
the quality of the quiet zone. For larger BS sizes larger size chambers
should be considered such that the uncertainty of the quiet zone is
taken into account.

The CATR is not suitable for low frequency measurements.

7.4 One Dimensional Compact Range
---------------------------------

### 7.4.1 Measurement system description

The principle of the One Dimensional Compact Range measurement setup is
shown in figure 7.4.1-1. It closely resembles the standard compact range
chamber. But for the generation of the plane wave in the quiet zone the
proposed method uses a special one dimensional probe instead of the
standard set up comprising a concave mirror and a feed horn. The main
advantage is a reduced chamber size and a simplified probe system
replacing the standard mirror feed horn set up.

height="2.798611111111111in"}

Figure 7.4.1-2: One Dimensional Compact Range measurement\
system setup for OTA sensitivity

The probe antenna is set up of a one dimensional array of antenna
modules, connected by a special feed system. Optimized amplitude and
phase settings in the feed system result in a plane wave in vertical
direction. As no near field to far field transformation has to be
carried out, it is not required to measure a whole set of azimuth and
elevation angles.

### 7.4.2 Test method limitations

One Dimensional Compact Range test method is only suitable for BS whose
*antenna array* consists of a single column *antenna array*. For a BS
equipped with multi-column *antenna array*, this method would not be
suitable due to the high amplitude uncertainty of edge column elements.
High amplitude uncertainty makes testing of the declared steering angles
not possible to meet EIRP accuracy requirements.

7.5 Near Field Test Range
-------------------------

### 7.5.1 Measurement system description

The Near Field Test Range (NFTR) measurement techniques consist in
measuring amplitude and phase of the modulated signal at the BS under
test, on some specific surfaces such as planar, cylindrical, and
spherical. Each of the near field test methods can be implemented by one
or more mechanical rotations of the probe and/or BS under test as shown
in figure 7.5.1. One or more mechanical movement can be substitute by a
probe array. All the scanning methods will need an RF transmit and
receive system equipped with an automated scanning, a data collection
and control system, and computerized analysis ability.

![NF setup](media/image77.png){width="4.402777777777778in"
height="1.5069444444444444in"}

Figure 7.5.1: Probe/scanner near field systems: spherical, cylindrical
and planar

NOTE: Although there are three methods available for obtaining the near
field data, the spherical method is used as a working example.

In case the radiated field is sampled on a sphere surrounding completely
the BS under test, the 3D full sphere value of the measured parameter
can be measured in near field when the BS is:

\- transmitting (for TX requirements) a defined modulated signals in a
declared beam, or

\- receiving (for RX requirements) a defined modulated signals.

The near field measurement technique would imply the use of mathematical
artefact, NF to FF transform in order to have the measured parameter\'s
value the in far field. The near field to far field transform is based
on the well-known Huygens-Fresnel principle. The spherical modal wave
expansion is the implicit application of the Huygens principle. A direct
solution of the Helmholtz equations is found by applying boundary
conditions on the surface S at infinity. From the tangential fields over
the surface, the modal coefficients can be determined using the
orthogonality of the modal expansion. Based on this formulation, the
near field sampling criteria does play an important role.

### 7.5.2 Test method limitations

#### 7.5.2.1 OTA EVM measurement

For BS implementations that point a beam in the EVM conformance
direction during testing, the near field technique may report too high,
but will never report too low EVM. In case the BS does not point a beam
centre in the test direction, there is a risk of the near field
technique report too low EVM.

#### 7.5.2.2 OTA RX directional requirements

There are some limitations on the use of that the BS must not have any
BB beam forming. Considering that BS must have at least 8 TRX the
probability of it meeting the restrictive conditions is small. In
addition there are some issues surrounding the interference requirements
when testing in the near field as the wanted and interfering signal may
experience different beam forming.

#### 7.5.2.3 OTA sensitivity measurement

The near field test method is suitable for OTA sensitivity measurement
of BS implementations where the beam forming is done on in a fixed or
pre-set manner for the measured OSDD declaration, i.e. there is only one
interface to digital/baseband processing. The near field test method is
not suitable if for the measured OSDD declaration any combining is not
fixed or preset. Some examples of architectures for which near field
test method is possible and for which it is not possible are depicted on
figure 7.5.2.3-2. The BS under test should not have any other non-linear
behaviour that would cause the near field to far field transformation to
fail or cause increased OTA sensitivity measurement uncertainty (for
example, Automatic Gain Control if applicable must be disabled and the
receiver dynamic range must be sufficient to prevent any increased
measurement uncertainty due to the range of the near field values.

7.6 Plane Wave Synthesizer
--------------------------

### 7.6.1 Measurement system description

This method is an extension of a CATR measurement method as captured in
clause 7.3, where the reflector is replaced by an *antenna array*, or
Plane Wave Synthesizer (PWS), capable of approximating a plane wave
within a specified quiet zone in front of the antenna in a similar
manner as the reflector in a CATR system.

The principle of the Plane Wave Synthesizer is shown in figure 7.6.1-1:

![](media/image82.png){width="5.277777777777778in"
height="2.361111111111111in"}

Figure 7.6.1-1: PWS measurement setup, Tx requirements

Figure 7.6.1-2: PWS measurement setup, Rx requirements

Figure 7.6.1-3: PWS measurement setup, OTA dynamic range, ACS, blocking
and ICS

Figure 7.6.1-4: PWS measurement setup, Receiver intermodulation

The PWS typically consists of two main components: the *radiating
elements* arranged in the structure of an array and the feeding system.
The architecture of the later depends on the adopted technology, e.g. it
could be fed by a standard Beam Forming Network (BFN) or by an active
system.

Using similar technique of setting the phase and amplitude of the array
signals, a quiet zone containing planar waves as a linear superposition
of the *array elements*\' spherical radiation waves can be created
within the near field of the array.

The PWS can achieve far-field testing conditions in a Quiet Zone (QZ) as
in the case of CATRs it enables direct measurements of far-field BS
performance in a controlled indoor environment as an alternative to
CATR.

### 7.6.2 Test method limitations

The maximum rated Power Density (PD) per section of the PWS area (e.g.
dBm/cm^2^) might be restricted depending on the implementation. This
Power Density at a specific reference plane can be calculated for each
BS as a function of the *total radiated power*, the test distance and
the *radiation pattern* of the BS.

7.7 General Chamber
-------------------

### 7.7.0 General

The term general chamber has been used in 2 different ways during the
analysis of the MU budgets the meaning of the term general chamber
differs for the following requirement types:

\- Co-location requirements, as described in clause 7.7.1 and 7.7.2,

\- Out-of-band TRP requirements, as described in clause 7.7.3 and 7.7.4.

For co-location requirements, the MU calculation focuses on the
uncertainties between the test equipment, the CLTA and the DUT as such
the precise chamber type is not relevant as such when calculation the MU
it was referred to as a General Chamber meaning any of the available
chamber types which are capable of performing the appropriate OTA
measurement associated with the co-location requirements.

For out-of-band spurious emissions and out-of-band blocking requirements
the frequency range specified is very great (1 MHz to 12.75 GHz) as such
many of the constraints on the band-specific chambers cannot be met, it
is possible that multiple chambers may be required to cover the whole
frequency range for example, so in this case the term General Chamber
was used to imply a non-specific chamber that was capable of meeting the
MU values specified.

### 7.7.1 Measurement system description (co-location requirements)

This section provides description of the chambers for the purpose of the
co-location requirements measurements, i.e.

\- OTA transmitter OFF power,

\- OTA co-location spurious emissions,

\- OTA transmitter intermodulation, and

\- OTA co-location blocking.

For more details on the co-location measurements, refer to clause 6.4.

The General Chamber represents any suitable OTA chamber which shields
the BS and CLTA form external interference and prevents reflections
within the chamber from altering the coupling between the BS and the
CLTA, i.e. any of the OTA measurement systems described in clauses 7.2
to 7.6 may be considered as example of the General Chamber.

![](media/image86.emf){width="5.548611111111111in" height="3.8125in"}

Figure 7.7.1-1: General chamber test system set up diagram for
co-location TX OFF and co-location emissions

The OTA measurement receiver must be capable of conforming that the BS
is radiating the wanted signal at the required power level, however the
measurement is made at the output of the CLTA. The diagram shows a
switch/limiter or filter which is used to reduce the level of the wanted
signal before the requirement is measured in the measurement device.

![](media/image87.emf){width="5.548611111111111in"
height="3.7083333333333335in"}

Figure 7.7.1-2: General chamber test system set up diagram for
co-location TX IMD

The General Chamber represents any chamber capable of performing the OTA
transmitter spurious emissions requirements, the OTA operating band
unwanted emissions requirements and the OTA ACLR requirements to the
specified accuracy.

### 7.7.2 Test method limitations (co-location requirements)

This method may be limited by the availability of suitable CLTA antenna.

### 7.7.3 Measurement system description (out-of-band TRP requirements)

This section provides description of the chambers for the purpose of the
following Out-of-band TRP requirements:

\- Transmitter mandatory spurious emissions, see clause 12.2.2,

\- Receiver spurious emissions, see clause 12.3.2.

\- Out-of-band blocking, see clause 14.2.

The General Chamber represents any suitable OTA chamber capable of
performing the out-of-band TRP requirements. Any OTA measurement systems
may be considered as example of the General Chamber as long as the MU is
within the specified value (or the test requirement is offset
appropriately) and they are suitable for the frequencies being tested.

### 7.7.4 Test method limitations (out-of-band TRP requirements)

Test method limitations of the specific OTA chamber used apply, see
clause 7.2.3, 7.3.3, 7.4.2, 7.5.2, 7.6.2, where applicable.

7.8 Reverberation chamber
-------------------------

### 7.8.1 Measurement system description

A reverberation chamber (RC) is an electrically large shielded metal
enclosure that employs one or several \"stirring\" methods to randomize
the fields, such as moving paddles, turntables, etc. In this way, a
large number of uncorrelated samples is obtained. The volume in the room
where the field is well-stirred is the working volume. Here the E-field,
averaged over an entire stirring cycle, is independent of the location
in the room, i.e. the field is spatially uniform.

For a proper analysis of the measured data a sufficient number of
uncorrelated samples is required. The auto-correlation function is used
to calculate the offset between statistically uncorrelated samples using
the following expression as in IEC 61000-4-21 \[11\]:

where the modulus operator mod(x,y) is the remainder of x/y, here
performing a circular shift of the measurement samples over a distance
k. The symbols ⟨x⟩ and σ = \"std\" (x) denote the average value and
standard deviation. The threshold value for uncorrelated samples,
r~lim~, is defined as in IEC 61000-4-21 \[11\]:

$r_{\lim} \leq \ 0.37(1 - 7.22/N^{0.64})$

The distance $k_{\lim}\ $between uncorrelated samples is calculated as
the minimum k-value satisfying $r(k) \leq r_{\lim}$. The number of
uncorrelated samples is calculated as:

When properly designed, this facility can be used for non-directional
antenna measurements, such as TRP. In fact, a well-stirred RC is capable
of measuring TRP in a reliable way, regardless of the directivity
pattern of the emission or frequency range. When measuring TRP of
sources with a directive pattern, special care must be taken to
characterize the working volume of the chamber.

The purpose of the chamber characterization is to ensure that the effect
of a non-uniform field distribution in the chamber has a negligible
influence on the measurement result when the BS is placed in the working
volume. Lack of chamber uniformity is a major contributor to measurement
uncertainty in reverberation chambers and should be handled with care.

The uniformity test can be quite time consuming and the test can be
performed separate from the BS measurement. Due to the non-negligible
size of BS equipment the BS can have a significant influence on the
uniformity. To take this effect into account, either the BS itself must
be present in the room during characterization or an absorber with
dimensions equal or larger than the BS must be placed at the BS\'s
location in the room.

The characterization procedure consists of placing a reference
transmitter antenna (REF TX ant) at different locations and with
different orientations in the room and measuring the Power Transfer
Function (PTF) between the REF TX and chamber\'s RX antenna, see figure
7.8.1-1. The actual mode of RC operation shall be used, including
stirrer movement, BS movement, diversity antenna usage, etc. The
directivity of the REF TX ant will influence the spatial uniformity of
the room, a more directive REF TX ant is better at detecting parts of
the room that are less-well stirred. Therefore, the REF TX ant chosen
for the uniformity test should excite the chamber in a similar way as
the BS.

![](media/image90.png){width="5.0in" height="4.465277777777778in"}

Figure 7.8.1-1: Setup for characterization of a reverberation chamber

The working volume shall be at least half a wavelength from the chamber
walls and other electromagnetic reflective objects according to \[12\].
According to IEC 61000-4-21 \[11\] this distance may be restricted to
0.75 m below 100 MHz. The number of positions and orientations to use
depends on the chamber size and the directivity of the REF TX ant.
Measurements made at positions and orientations at the edges of the
working volume are used to characterize the chamber and derive certain
components of uncertainty.

The exact number of positions and orientations remain for further study,
but at least (3) uncorrelated locations should be used and (6)
uncorrelated orientations per position when directive spurs are to be
detected.

Different test equipment set ups can be used for the acquisition of the
PTF between REF TX and RX. Such as devices capable of directly
extracting the PTF, like a Vector Network Analyzer (VNA) or a set up
with separate transmitter and receiver test equipment, such as a Signal
Generator (SG) and Spectrum/signal Analyzer (SA) configuration. In the
latter case the operator should account for the losses in the set up
originating from cables, mismatch, etc.

When using a VNA, the REF TX ant and the measurement receive antenna
(RX) are connected to the test equipment. For each location/orientation
*n* of the REF TX ant, RC sample, and desired frequency *f*, the power
transfer function

$P_{n} = \left\langle \left| S_{21} \right|^{2} \right\rangle$

is measured. The explicit dependence on RC sample and frequency is not
written out here.

In case of using a SG and SA the PTF is calculated as follows:

$P_{n}\  = \ \frac{\left\langle \left| {U_{r}}^{2} \right| \right\rangle}{50\ P_{t}M_{t}L_{s}}$

with U~r~ the received voltage, 50 Ω being the reference impedance of
the SA, P~t~ the transmit power of the signal source, L~s~ the losses in
in the cables, Mt the mismatch efficiency at the TX antenna calculated
as $M_{t} = \ 1 - \left| S_{11} \right|^{2}$.

At least 250 uncorrelated samples shall be used per
position/orientation. Using a lower number is not compatible with the
underlying analysis on measurement uncertainty, see IEC
61000-4-21 \[11\] and publication in \[13\].

The following tests are performed and shall be verified for each
frequency:

a\) Uniformity of transfer function: For each location/orientation
evaluate *P~n~*. The standard deviation of these average values shall be
below the assumed measurement uncertainty level for A6-7 uncertainty
contributor, as described in annex A.6.

b\) Dynamic range: The dynamic range of each *P~n~* shall be at least 20
dB.

c\) Uncorrelated samples: At least 250 uncorrelated samples shall be
used.

It is important to note that spatial uniformity (and number of
uncorrelated samples) in an RC is harder to achieve for more directive
antenna patterns. As such, the measurement uncertainty of a
sub-optimally configured room will be higher and additional measures to
randomize the fields should be considered. Optimization of the BS
position in the chamber and positional stirring are good starting
points.

### 7.8.2 Test method limitations

The reverberation chamber test method is not suitable for testing
spurious emissions at very low frequencies. The MU evaluation is
applicable for the frequency above 380 MHz.

8 Measurement system calibration
================================

8.1 General
-----------

Calibration of the OTA measurement systems is assumed to be the same for
FR1 and FR2 frequencies, unless otherwise stated.

8.2 Indoor Anechoic Chamber calibration
---------------------------------------

Calibration shall be done to ensure that the SNR at the measurement
equipment input is appropriate and the reception signal level at the
measurement equipment is within the dynamic range of measurement
equipment.

1\) Calibration system configuration

For TX requirements: connect the reference antenna and the receiving
antenna to the measurement RF out port and RF in port of the network
analyzer, respectively, as shown in figure 8.2-1. The amplifier may be
installed between C and D if required.

Figure 8.2-1: Indoor Anechoic Chamber calibration system setup for TX
requirements

For RX requirements: Connect the reference antenna and the transmitting
antenna to RF in port and RF out port of the network analyzer,
respectively, as shown in figure 8.2-2.

height="5.166666666666667in"}

Figure 8.2-2: Indoor Anechoic Chamber calibration system setup for RX
requirements

2\) Install the reference antenna with its *beam peak direction* and the
height of its phase centre aligned with the receiving antenna, or
transmitting antenna (in case of transmitter or receiver requirement,
respectively).

3\) Set the centre frequency of the network analyzer to the carrier
centre frequency of the tested signal and measure LF~E→D~, which is
equivalent to 20log\|S21\| (dB) obtained by the network analyzer:

\- LF~E→D~: Pathloss between E and D in figure 8.2-1 (for Tx
requirements) and 8.2-2 (for Rx requirements).

4\) Measure the cable loss, LF~E→F~ between the reference antenna
connector and the network analyzer connector:

\- LF~E→F~: Cable loss between E and F in figure 15.1-1.

5\) Calculate the calibration value between A and D with the following
formulas:

\- L~cal,\ A→D~ = LF~E→D~ + G~REF\_ANT,\ F→A~ - LF~E→F~.

\- L~cal,\ A→D~: Calibration value between A and D in figure 8.2-1 (for
Tx requirements) and 8.2-2 (for Rx requirements).

\- G~REF\_ANT,\ A→F~: *Antenna gain* of the reference antenna.

8.3 Compact Antenna Test Range calibration
------------------------------------------

The calibration measurement is done by using a reference antenna (SGH
used in figure 8.3-1 or 8.3-2) with known efficiency or gain values. In
the calibration measurement the reference antenna is measured in the
same place as the BS, and the attenuation of the complete transmission
path (C↔A, as in figure 8.3-1 or 8.3-2) from the BS to the measurement
receiver is calibrated out. Figures 8.3-1 and 8.3-2 presents a setup of
a typical compact antenna test range for TX and RX requirements,
respectively.

Figure 8.3-1: CATR calibration system setup, TX requirements

Figure 8.3-2: CATR calibration system setup, RX requirements

1\) Path loss calibration C→A:

a\) Measure SGH (or other calibrated reference antenna) reflection
coefficient separately at the antenna\'s connector with a network
analyser (or equivalent measurement equipment) to obtain Γ~SGH~.

b\) Measure cable loss from point C to input of SGH, call this L~C↔SGH~
which is the equivalent of 20log\|S~21~\| from the use of a network
analyser.

c\) Calculate the combined total path loss from C→A by using the
following expression:

L~SGHcal~ = L~C,SGH~ + 10log(1 - \|Γ~SGH~\|^2^) - G~SGH~,

where$\Gamma$ 10log(1 - \|Γ~SGH~\|^2^) *is the compensation for SGH
connector return loss,* G~SGH~ *is the known gain of the reference SGH*.

2\) Connect SGH and C↔A cable.

3\) To remove polarization(s) mismatch between range antenna (labelled
as feeder antenna in diagram) and SGH use positions to position the SGH
in the boresight of range antenna.

4\) Measure path loss C→B with network analyzer L~C~→~B~ =
20log\|S~21~\|.

5\) Calculate the test path loss compensation factor. This is the total
path loss between A↔B using the results from step 1c and 4. L =
L~SGHcal~ *-* L~C~→~B~.

Where Γ~SGH~ is the reflection coefficient (or mismatch) seen at the SGH
connector (S~11~ with a network analyzer).

The CATR test setup and calibration for FR2 are expected to be similar
to those of FR1, although the test chamber dimensions and associated MU
values will scale due to the shorter wavelengths and larger relative
array apertures. However, it is noted that in order to achieve the test
instrument uncertainties that were assumed, calibration of the spectrum
analyzer may be needed.

8.4 One Dimensional Test Range calibration
------------------------------------------

8.5 Near Field Test Range calibration
-------------------------------------

Calibration accounts for the various factors affecting the measurements.
These factors include components such as range length path loss, cable
losses, gain of the receiving antenna, etc. Each measured data point for
both radiated power and radiated sensitivity is transformed from a
relative value in dB to an absolute value in dBm. For doing that the
total path loss from the BS to the measurement receiver, named L path
loss is calibrated out. The calibration measurement is usually done by
using a reference antenna with known gain. This approach is based on the
so called gain-comparison method as in IEEE Standard Test Procedures for
Antennas \[7\]. Figure 8.5-1 shows the typical configuration for
measuring path loss.

![Typical Path Loss Measurement configurationFigure
10](media/image95.png){width="6.291666666666667in"
height="3.1944444444444446in"}

Figure 8.5-1: Typical L~path~ loss measurement configuration

The L~path~ pathloss can be determined from the power into the reference
antenna by adding the gain of the reference antenna:

P~iso~ = P~ref~ + G~ref~

so that:

L~path~ = P~ref~ + G~ref~ - P~test~

In order to determine P~ref~, a cable reference measurement is performed
in order to calibrate out the A, and B paths. Assuming that the power at
the source is fixed, it can be showed that:

P~ref~ -- P~test~ = P~rec~\' - P~rec~

Where P~rec~ and P~rec~\' are the power measured at the receiver during
the calibration measurement with the reference antenna and the power
measured at the receiver during the cable reference measurement
respectively. L~path~ loss is then given by:

L~path~ = G~ref~ + P~rec~\' -- P~rec~

8.6 Plane Wave Synthesizer calibration
--------------------------------------

The calibration measurement is done by using a reference antenna with
known efficiency or gain values (e.g. SGH). In the calibration
measurement the reference antenna is measured in the same place as the
BS, and the attenuation of the complete transmission path (C↔A, see
figure 8.6-1) from the BS to the measurement receiver is calibrated out.

Figure 8.6-2: Path loss calibration in PWS, RX requirements

1\) Path loss calibration E→A:

a\) Measure SGH (or other calibrated reference antenna) reflection
coefficient separately at the antenna\'s connector with a network
analyzer (or equivalent measurement equipment) to obtain Γ~SGH~.

b\) Measure cable loss from point E to input of SGH, call this L~E↔SGH~
which is the equivalent of 20log\|S~21~\| from the use of a network
analyzer.

c\) Calculate the combined total path loss from E→A by using the
following expression:

L~SGHcal~ = L~E,SGH~ + 10log(1 - \|Γ~SGH~\|^2^) - G~SGH~, where$\Gamma$
10log(1 - \|Γ~SGH~\|^2^) is the compensation for SGH connector return
loss, G~SGH~ is the known gain of the reference SGH.

2\) Connect SGH and D↔E cable.

3\) Measure path loss C→E with network analyzer L~C~→~E~ =

4\) Calculate the test path loss compensation factor. This is the total
path loss between C↔A using the results from step 1c and 3. L =

The CLTA path is calibrated as follows:

1\) Cable and matching loss calibration for CLTA for each polarization
supported by the CLTA

a\) Measure CLTA reflection coefficient separately at the antenna\'s
connector with a network analyser (or equivalent measurement equipment)
to obtain Γ~ANT~.

b\) Measure cable loss from input of CLTA (A) to point B for TX OFF and
co-location spurious emissions and from point B to input of CLTA (A) for
TX IMD, call this L ~ANT↔F~ which is the equivalent of 20log\|S~21~\|
from the use of a network analyser.

c\) Calculate the combined total path loss from F to CLTA using the
following equation:

Lcal = L ~ANT↔F~ + 10log(1 - \|Γ~ANT~\|^2^)

8.7A General Chamber calibration (out-of-band TRP requirements)
---------------------------------------------------------------

The General Chamber here refers to the one described in clause 7.7.3.

The OTA path of the General Chamber is calibrated according to its
chamber type using the methodology in clause 8.2 to 8.6.

8.8 Reverberation chamber calibration
-------------------------------------

To correctly determine the TRP by the BS a calibration step to account
for losses in cables, antennas, etc. is required. A reference PTF is
determined at each frequency of interest by using a relevant reference
TX antenna (REF TX ant). The chamber should be set up identically to the
actual set up of the TRP measurement, which means the BS has to be in
the room, the same stirring procedure has to be used, etc.

A minimum N~ref~ = 1 reference measurement is required, but it is noted
that more measurements can be used to estimate the reference PTF and
that this will lead to a reduction of the uncertainty by a factor . The
radiation efficiency, η, of the reference antenna can be assumed to be
the value declared by the manufacturer or can be determined in a
separate antenna efficiency measurement.

Figure 8.8-1: The procedure for TRP measurements uses three consecutive
setups: (a) Reference measurement, (b) ambient noise measurement (b),
and (c) TRP measurement. The blue dots indicate the measurement planes

Calibration procedure:

1\) Place the BS and the REF TX ant in the working volume of the RC.
Turn off BS power and BS controls. See figure 8.8-1 (a). If more
positions are used to determine the reference PTF the REF TX ant should
be placed at uncorrelated positions within the test volume.

2\) Set the stirrers and turntables in the mode of operation used in the
chamber characterization.

3\) Set the sampling rate as in the chamber characterization.

4\) Connect the REF TX ant and the RX antenna with a calibrated Network
analyser (NA).

5\) Measure the scattering parameters or received power over a complete
stirring cycle for each frequency of interest and for each position and
orientation.

6\) Calculate the reference transfer function, P^(r)^$S$.

7\) Calculate the mis-match efficiency, M~1~^(r)^.

9 TX directional requirements
=============================

9.1 General
-----------

Most TX directional requirements require demodulation of the transmitted
signal using the \"global in-channel TX test\" as described e.g. in
annex L of TS 38.141-2 \[6\] for NR.

For simplicity since L~path~ requirements do not all use the same
RAT-specific test models, the OTA test procedures have been kept general
by using \"applicable test signal\" where the RAT-specific test models
can be found in AAS BS or NR BS test specifications TS 37.145-2 \[4\]
and TS 38.141-2 \[6\], respectively.

Some requirements are differential and hence many of the calibration and
OTA measurement uncertainties may cancel. These are investigated on a
case by case basis.

NOTE 1: All the calibration and test procedures are valid for FR1 as
well as FR2, unless otherwise stated.

NOTE 2: All the MU and TT values derivations are valid for Normal test
conditions, unless otherwise stated.

NOTE 3: The FR2 MU assessment was carried out using a CATR chamber only
however other chamber types are not precluded if suitable MU assessment
is done.

9.2 EIRP accuracy, Normal test conditions
-----------------------------------------

### 9.2.1 General

Clause 9.2 captures MU and TT values derivation for the EIRP accuracy
directional requirement in Normal test conditions.

For the MU and TT values derivation for the EIRP accuracy in Extreme
test conditions, refer to clause 9.3. Specification of Normal and
Extreme test conditions is captured in TS 38.141-2 \[6\] for NR BS (i.e.
*BS type 1-O* and *BS type 2-O*), and in TS 37.145‑2 \[4\] for OTA AAS
BS.

#### 9.2.2.1 Measurement system description

Measurement system description is captured in clause 7.2.1.

#### 9.2.2.2 Test procedure

##### 9.2.2.2.1 Stage 1: Calibration

Calibration procedure for the Indoor Anechoic Chamber is captured in
clause 8.2 with the calibration system setup for TX requirements
depicted in figure 8.2-1.

##### 9.2.2.2.2 Stage 2: BS measurement

The IAC testing procedure consists of the following steps:

1\) Uninstall the reference antenna and install the BS with the
manufacturer declared coordinate system reference point in the same
place as the phase centre of the reference antenna. The manufacturer
declared coordinate system orientation of the BS is set to be aligned
with the testing system.

2\) Set the BS to generate the tested beam with the *beam peak
direction* intended to be the same as the testing direction.

3\) Rotate the BS to make the testing direction aligned with the
direction of the receiving antenna.

4\) Set the BS to transmit the test signal at the maximum power
according to applicable test model.

5\) Measure the mean power for each carrier arriving at the measurement
equipment connector, denoted by P~R\_EIRP, D~, which is defined as
measured mean power for each carrier at the measurement equipment
connector at the reference point D in figure 7.2.1-1.

6\) Calculate the EIRP with the following formula:

EIRP = P~R\_EIRP,\ D~ + L~EIRP\_cal,\ A→D~

7\) Calculate total EIRP = EIRP~p1~ + EIRP~p2~ where the declared beam
is the measured signal for any two orthogonal polarizations (denoted p1
and p2).

8\) Repeat the above steps 2 - 7 per conformance test *beam direction
pair*.

### 9.2.3 Compact Antenna Test Range

#### 9.2.3.1 Measurement system description

Measurement system description is captured in clause 7.3.1.

#### 9.2.3.2 Test procedure

##### 9.2.3.2.1 Stage 1: Calibration

Calibration procedure for the Compact Antenna Test Range is captured in
clause 8.3 with the calibration system setup for TX requirements
depicted in figure 8.3-1.

##### 9.2.3.2.2 Stage 2: BS measurement

The CATR testing procedure consists of the following steps:

1\) Set up BS in place of SGH from calibration stage. Align BS with
*beam peak direction* of range antenna.

2\) Configure TX branch and carrier according to maximum power
requirement and test configuration.

3\) Set the BS to transmit the test signal according to applicable test
model.

4\) Measure mean power (P~meas~) of each carrier arriving at the
measurement equipment (such as a spectrum analyzer or power meter)
denoted in figure 8.3-1.

5\) Calculate EIRP, where EIRP = P~meas~ + L~A~→~B~.

6\) Calculate total EIRP = EIRP~p1~ + EIRP~p2~ where the declared beam
is the measured signal for any two orthogonal polarizations (denoted p1
and p2).

7\) Repeat steps 2 - 6 for all conformance test *beam direction pairs*.

#### 9.2.3.4 MU value derivation, FR2

The MU assessment was carried out using a CATR chamber only however
other chamber types are not precluded if suitable MU assessment is done.

A CATR MU budget was assessed in order to determine acceptable MU for
the EIRP accuracy measurement in FR2. The CATR test setup and
calibration and measurement procedures for FR2 are expected to be
similar to those of FR1, although the test chamber dimensions and
associated MU values will scale due to the shorter wavelengths and
larger relative array apertures.

Table 9.2.3.4-1 captures the uncertainty budget contributors and table
9.2.3.4-2 captures the derivation of the expanded measurement
uncertainty values for EIRP accuracy measurements in CATR (Normal test
conditions, FR2).

### 9.2.4 One Dimensional Compact Range

#### 9.2.4.1 Measurement system description

Measurement system description is captured in clause 7.4.1.

#### 9.2.4.2 Test procedure

##### 9.2.4.2.1 Stage 1: Calibration

Calibration procedure for the One Dimensional Compact Range is captured
in clause 8.4.

##### 9.2.4.2.2 Stage 2: BS measurement

The One Dimensional Compact Range testing procedure consists of the
following steps:

1\) Connect the receive network of the compact probe to the measurement
equipment.

2\) Calibrate the test range, using a reference antenna with standard
gain installed in the quiet zone of the probe and measure the path loss
between reference antenna and the measurement equipment.

3\) Install the BS in the quiet zone of the probe with its manufacturer
declared coordinate system reference point in the same place as the
phase centre of the reference antenna. The manufacturer declared
coordinate system orientation of the BS is set to be aligned with
testing system.

4\) Align with the required conformance steering directions.

5\) Set the BS to transmit at maximum EIRP appropriate to conformance
steering directions according to the manufacturer declaration.

6\) Measure the received power at the probe and thus the EIRP of the BS.

7\) Calculate total EIRP = EIRP~p1~ + EIRP~p2~ where the declared beam
is the measured signal for any two orthogonal polarizations (denoted p1
and p2).

8\) Repeat test steps 2 - 7 for all declared beams and corresponding
conformance steering directions.

with the BS transmitting a defined modulated signal, as defined in
appropriate conformance test specification.

2\) BS near field to far field transformation: the near field power
calibration is applied.

The near field to far field transformation is a mathematical computation
which is applied to the near field measured *radiation pattern* in order
to compute the far field *radiation pattern*. It is typically performed
expanding the measured near field over a set of orthogonal basis
functions. The near to far field transform is then performed in two
steps:

1\) Expansion (or projection) of the measured near field (i.e.
*E~meas~(r)*) over a set of orthogonal basis functions (i.e.
*F~basis~(r)*) in order to evaluate the transformed spectrum:

E~meas~(r) = Spectrum \* F~basis~(r)

2\) FF (i.e. E~FF~) computation using the previously calculated spectrum
and with the basis functions evaluated at r∞ (i.e. *F~basis~(r ∞)*):

E~FF~ = Spectrum \* F~basis~(r ∞)

When performing the near field to far field transformation, the gain
calibration is applied so that the near field pattern will be
transformed from relative power (i.e. dB) to absolute power (i.e. dBm).
In this specific case, the EIRP far field pattern is expressed in terms
of the absolute power radiated by the BS in the declared beam:

1\) BS radiated transmit power: once the full 3D far field EIRP pattern
has been computed, the radiated transmit power can be derived.

### 9.2.6 Plane Wave Synthesizer

#### 9.2.6.1 Measurement system description

Measurement system description is captured in clause 7.6.1.

#### 9.2.6.2 Test procedure

##### 9.2.6.2.1 Stage 1: Calibration

Calibration procedure for the Plane Wave Synthesizer is captured in
clause 8.6 with the calibration system setup for TX requirements
depicted in figure 8.6-1.

##### 9.2.6.2.2 Stage 2: BS measurement

The PWS testing procedure consists of the following steps:

1\) Install the BS with the manufacturer declared coordinate system
reference point in the same place as the phase center of the reference
antenna A as shown in figure 7.6.1-1. The manufacturer declared
coordinate system orientation of the BS is set to be aligned with the
testing system.

2\) Set the BS to generate the tested beam with the applicable test
model with the *beam peak direction* intended to be the same as the
testing direction.

3\) Measure mean power (P~meas~) at the measurement equipment (such as a
spectrum analyzer or power meter) denoted in figure 7.6.1-1.

4\) Calculate EIRP, where EIRP = P~meas~ + L~C~→~A~.

5\) Calculate total EIRP = EIRP~p1~ + EIRP~p2~ where the declared beam
is the measured signal for any two orthogonal polarizations (denoted p1
and p2).

6\) Repeat steps 2 - 5 for all conformance test *beam direction pairs*
and test conditions.

NOTE: In the legacy technical reports for BS testability (RAN4) or UE
testability (RAN5), the MU/TT derivation tables were using UID as
counting numbers across multiple test chambers and requirement\'s
clauses. In this TR a simplified approach was taken with the UID\'s
being the annex number of the measurement uncertainty source
description.

### 9.2.7 Maximum accepted test system uncertainty

Maximum test system uncertainties derivation methodology was described
in clause 5.1. The maximum accepted test system uncertainty values was
derived based on test system specific values.

According to the methodology referred above, the common maximum accepted
test system uncertainty values for the EIRP accuracy test can be derived
from values captured in table 9.2.7-1, separately for each of the
defined frequency ranges. The common maximum accepted test system
uncertainty values are applicable for all test methods addressing EIRP
accuracy test requirement in Normal test conditions. Based on input
values in table 9.2.7-1, the expanded uncertainty *u~e~* (1.96σ -
confidence interval of 95 %) values were derived for frequency ranges as
below:

\- For the frequency range up to 4.2 GHz (with the breakdown point at
3 GHz), the same MU values as for E‑UTRA in TS 37.145-2 \[4\] were
adopted also for NR operation below 4.2 GHz. It is expected that the
test chamber setup, calibration and measurement procedures for E-UTRA
and NR will be highly similar. All uncertainty factors were judged to be
the same. The MU value was thus agreed to be 1.1 dB for up to 3 GHz
bands.

\- For the frequency range 4.2 - 6 GHz, all MU factors including
instrumentation related MU were judged to be the same as for the 3 -
4.2 GHz range, and thus the total MU for 4.2 -- 6 GHz is the same as for
3 - 4.2 GHz. This assessment was made under the assumption of testing BS
designed for licensed spectrum; for unlicensed spectrum the MU may
differ. The MU value was thus agreed to be 1.3 dB for 3 -- 6 GHz bands.
The MU in 4.2 - 6 GHz is valid for BS designed to operate in licensed
spectrum.

\- Based on CATR inputs in clause 9.2.3.4, for the frequency range 24.25
\< f \< 29.5 GHz the MU was decided to be 1.7 dB.

\- Based on CATR inputs in clause 9.2.3.4, for the frequency range 37 \<
f \< 43.5 GHz the MU was decided to be 2.0 dB.

### 9.3.3 Compact Antenna Test Range

#### 9.3.3.1 Measurement system description

Measurement system description for the CATR measurement in the Extreme
test environment is captured in clause 7.3.2.

#### 9.3.3.2 Test procedure

##### 9.3.3.2.1 Stage 1: Calibration

The CATR calibration for FR2 are expected to be similar to those of FR1,
although the test chamber dimensions and associated MU values will scale
due to the shorter wavelengths and larger relative array apertures.

Calibration shall be done with the same procedure shown in
clause 9.2.3.2.1 (i.e. EIRP accuracy calibration procedure for Normal
test conditions) to ensure that the SNR at the measurement equipment
input is appropriate for the measurement of the requirement and the
reception signal level at the measurement equipment is within the
dynamic range of measurement equipment.

##### 9.3.3.2.2 Stage 2: BS measurement

The CATR test setup and measurement procedures for FR2 are expected to
be similar to those of FR1, although the test chamber dimensions and
associated MU values will scale due to the shorter wavelengths and
larger relative array apertures.

Reference procedure in clause 9.2.3.2.2 (i.e. EIRP accuracy measurement
procedure for Normal test conditions).

### 9.3.4 Maximum accepted test system uncertainty

For the frequency range up to 4.2 GHz, the same MU values as for E-UTRA
in TS 37.145-2 \[4\] were adopted. It is expected that the test chamber
setup, calibration and measurement procedures for E-UTRA and NR will be
highly similar. All uncertainty factors were judged to be the same.

For the frequency range 4.2 - 6 GHz, all MU factors, including
instrumentation related MU were judged to be the same as for the 3 -
4.2 GHz range, and thus the total MU for 4.2 -- 6 GHz is the same as for
3 - 4.2 GHz. This assessment was made under the assumption of testing BS
designed for licensed spectrum; for unlicensed spectrum the MU may
differ.

The MU value was thus agreed to be 2.5 dB for up to 3 GHz bands and 2.6
dB for 3 -- 6 GHz bands. The MU in 4.2 - 6 GHz is valid for BS designed
to operate in licensed spectrum.

For FR2, for the direct far field method the MU budget is very similar
to the existing MU budget for the EIRP accuracy requirement. However
there are a number of additional sources of uncertainty due to the
environmental enclosure that need to be added to the budget. For FR2
only the CATR MU budget has been assessed however other suitable camber
types are not precluded.

Based on the above evaluation, the MU was decided to be 3.1 dB for the
frequency range 24.25 \< f \< 29.5 GHz and 3.3 dB for the frequency
range 37 \< f \< 43.5 GHz.

### 9.3.5 Test Tolerance for EIRP accuracy, Extreme test conditions

Considering the methodology described in clause 5.1, Test Tolerance
values for EIRP were derived based on values captured in clause 9.3.4.

The TT was decided to be the same as the MU for EIRP accuracy in FR1.

The TT was decided to be the same as the MU for EIRP accuracy in FR2.

Frequency range specific Test Tolerance values for the EIRP accuracy
test are defined in table 9.3.5-1.

9.4 OTA E-UTRA DL RS power
--------------------------

### 9.4.1 General

Clause 9.4 captures MU and TT values derivation for the OTA E-UTRA DL RS
power directional requirement.

DL RS power is an E-UTRA specific measurement applicable to the OTA AAS
BS, and it is defined as:

\- The DL RS power is the resource element power of the Downlink
Reference Symbol at the RIB transmitting the DL RS for a cell.

\- The absolute DL RS power is indicated on the DL-SCH. The absolute
accuracy is defined as the maximum deviation between the DL RS power
indicated on the DL-SCH and the DL RS power of each E-UTRA carrier.

As such it is an absolute power (i.e. EIRP) measurement of a single RE.

It is assumed that the value broadcast on DL-SCH is a conducted or TRP
value, since the power is measured at the antenna connector. To
facilitate efficient testing, OTA DL RS power is tested by measuring
EIRP as a directional requirement, and compared with a declared DL RS
EIRP derived from the power broadcast on the DL-SCH and the BS
directivity in the direction to be tested. This is sufficient to
demonstrate the ability of the physical layer to deliver accurate RS
power.

As the requirement is based on absolute directional power the absolute
level will be subject to the same calibration and measurement errors as
the EIRP measurement (in Normal test conditions). However as the
measurement is for a single RE it is necessary to demodulate the
received signal and this is done at the same time as the OTA EVM test
using the \"global in-channel TX test\" as described in annex L of
TS 38.141-2 \[6\] for NR.

The demodulated power accuracy test is not as accurate as the power
measurement using a power meter for the EIRP accuracy test.

The MU is calculated by using the conducted MU in the MU uncertainty
budget in place of the RF measurement equipment.

### 9.4.2 Indoor Anechoic Chamber

#### 9.4.2.1 Measurement system description

Measurement system description is captured in clause 7.2.1.

#### 9.4.2.2 Test procedure

##### 9.4.2.2.1 Stage 1: Calibration

Calibration procedure for the Indoor Anechoic Chamber is captured in
clause 8.2 with the calibration system setup for TX requirements
depicted in figure 8.2-1.

##### 9.4.2.2.2 Stage 2: BS measurement

The IAC testing procedure consists of the following steps:

1\) Uninstall the reference antenna and install the BS with the
manufacturer declared coordinate system reference point in the same
place as the phase centre of the reference antenna. The manufacturer
declared coordinate system orientation of the BS is set to be aligned
with the testing system.

2\) Set the BS to generate the tested beam with the *beam peak
direction* intended to be the same as the testing direction.

3\) Rotate the BS to make the testing direction aligned with the
direction of the receiving antenna.

4\) Set the BS to transmit the test signal at the maximum power
according to applicable test model.

5\) Measure the P~DL\_RS~, which is the measured signal power of DL RS
EIRP (in the *beam peak direction*).

6\) Calculate the EIRP~DL\_RS~ with the following formula:

EIRP~DL\_RS~ = P~DL\_RS~ + L~TX\_cal,\ A→D~

and

EIRP~DL\_RS~ = EIRP~DL\_RS\_p1~ + EIRP~DL\_RS\_p2~

where the declared beam is the measured signal for any two orthogonal
polarizations (denoted p1 and p2).

7\) Repeat steps 2 - 6 for all conformance test *beam direction pairs*
and test conditions.

#### 9.4.2.3 MU value derivation, FR1

As the DL RS power is an absolute measurement most of the uncertainties
form the EIRP accuracy remain the same. Also it can be noted that the
measured signal is a wanted signal and hence will be beam formed in the
same way as the wanted signal, hence any errors which may be dependent
on the beam shape will be the same as for the EIRP accuracy measurement.

### 9.4.3 Compact Antenna Test Range

#### 9.4.3.1 Measurement system description

Measurement system description is captured in clause 7.3.1.

#### 9.4.3.2 Test procedure

##### 9.4.3.2.1 Stage 1: Calibration

Calibration procedure for the Compact Antenna Test Range is captured in
clause 8.3.

##### 9.4.3.2.2 Stage 2: BS measurement

The CATR testing procedure consists of the following steps:

1\) Set up BS in place of SGH from calibration stage. Align BS with
*beam peak direction* of range antenna.

2\) Configure TX branch and carrier according to maximum power
requirement and test configuration.

4\) Set the BS to transmit the applicable test signal.

5\) Measure the P~DL\_RS~ which is the measured signal power of DL RS
EIRP (in the *beam peak direction*).

6\) Calculate EIRP~DL\_RS~ using the following equation:

EIRP~DL\_RS\_p(x)~ = P~DL\_RS\_meas~ + L~A~→~B~.

And

EIRP~DL\_RS~ = EIRP~DL\_RS\_p1~ + EIRP~DL\_RS\_p2~ where the declared
beam is the measured signal for any two orthogonal polarizations
(denoted p1 and p2).

7\) Repeat steps 2-6 for all conformance test *beam direction pairs* and
test conditions.

#### 9.4.3.3 MU value derivation, FR1

As the DL RS power is an absolute measurement most of the uncertainties
form the EIRP accuracy remain the same. Also it can be noted that the
measured signal is a wanted signal and hence will be beam formed in the
same way as the wanted signal, hence any errors which may be dependent
on the beam shape will be the same as for the EIRP accuracy measurement.

### 9.4.4 Near Field Test Range

#### 9.4.4.1 Measurement system description

Measurement system description is captured in clause 7.5.1.

#### 9.4.4.2 Test procedure

##### 9.4.4.2.1 Stage 1: Calibration

Calibration procedure for the Near Field Test Range is captured in
clause 8.5.

##### 9.4.4.2.2 Stage 2: BS measurement

The NFTR testing procedure consists of the following steps:

1\) BS near field *radiation pattern* measurement: this is performed
with the BS transmitting a defined modulated signal, as defined in
applicable conformance test specification.

a\) DL RS is measured during near field *radiation pattern* measurement
and used as the basis for the NF to FF transformation.

2\) BS near field to far field transformation: the near field power
calibration is applied.

The near field to far field transformation is a mathematical computation
which is applied to the near field measured *radiation pattern* in order
to compute the far field *radiation pattern*. It is typically performed
expanding the measured near field over a set of orthogonal basis
functions. The near to far field transform is then performed in two
steps:

1\) Expansion (or projection) of the measured near field (i.e. Emeas(r))
over a set of orthogonal basis functions (i.e. Fbasis(r)) in order to
evaluate the transformed spectrum:

Emeas(r) = Spectrum \* Fbasis(r)

2\) FF (i.e. EFF) computation using the previuosly calculated spectrum
and with the basis functions evaluated at r∞ (i.e. Fbasis(r ∞)):

EFF = Spectrum \* Fbasis(r ∞)

When performing the near field to far field transformation, the gain
calibration is applied so that the near field pattern will be
transformed from relative power (i.e. dB) to absolute power (i.e. dBm).
In this specific case, the EIRP far field pattern is expressed in terms
of the absolute power radiated by the BS in the declared beam:

1\) DL RS power EIRP: once the full 3D far field EIRP pattern has been
computed, the DL RS power EIRP can be derived at the *beam peak
direction* according to the declared *beam direction pair*.

### 9.4.5 Plane Wave Synthesizer

#### 9.4.5.1 Measurement system description

Measurement system description is captured in clause 7.6.1.

#### 9.4.5.2 Test procedure

##### 9.4.5.2.1 Stage 1: Calibration

Calibration procedure for the Plane Wave Synthesizer is captured in
clause 8.6.

##### 9.4.5.2.2 Stage 2: BS measurement

The PWS testing procedure consists of the following steps:

1\) Set up BS in place of SGH from calibration stage. Align BS with
*beam peak direction* of range antenna.

2\) Configure TX branch and carrier according to maximum power
requirement and test configuration.

3\) Set the BS to transmit the applicable test signal.

4\) Measure the P~DL\_RS~ which is the measured signal power of DL RS
EIRP (in the *beam peak direction*).

5\) Calculate EIRP~DL\_RS~ using the following equation:

EIRP~DL\_RS\_p(x)~ = P~DL\_RS\_meas~ + L~A~→~C~.

And

EIRP~DL\_RS~ = EIRP~DL\_RS\_p1~ + EIRP~DL\_RS\_p2~ where the declared
beam is the measured signal for any two orthogonal polarizations
(denoted p1 and p2).

6\) Repeat steps 2-5 for all conformance test *beam direction pairs* and
test conditions.

#### 9.4.5.3 MU value derivation, FR1

As the DL RS power is an absolute measurement most of the uncertainties
form the EIRP accuracy remain the same. Also it can be noted that the
measured signal is a wanted signal and hence will be beam formed in the
same way as the wanted signal, hence any errors which may be dependent
on the beam shape will be the same as for the EIRP accuracy measurement.

### 9.4.6 Maximum accepted test system uncertainty

Maximum test system uncertainties derivation methodology was described
in clause 5.1. The maximum accepted test system uncertainty values was
derived based on test system specific values.

According to the methodology referred above, the common maximum accepted
test system uncertainty values for the OTA E-UTRA DL RS power test can
be derived from values captured in table 9.4.6-1, separately for each of
the defined frequency ranges. The common maximum values are applicable
for all test methods addressing OTA E-UTRA DL RS power test requirement.
Based on the input values, the expanded uncertainty *u~e~* (1.96σ -
confidence interval of 95 %) values were derived.

9.5 OTA output power dynamics
-----------------------------

### 9.5.1 General

Clause 9.5 captures MU and TT values derivation for the OTA output power
dynamics directional requirement.

There are a number of UTRA and E-UTRA dynamic power requirements, they
are all relative requirements which specify the dynamic range and step
size accuracy of UTRA code domain channels and E-UTRA RE\'s.

As the requirements are differential many of the measurement uncertainty
values may cancel out however, in some cases demodulated signal power
level (code domain power or RE power) are compared to maximum carrier
power. As such the differential measurements may use different test
equipment setting and hence not all test equipment uncertainties are
cancelled out.

In all cases the measured signal are wanted signals and will be subject
to the same beam forming as the main beam.

### 9.5.2 Indoor Anechoic Chamber

#### 9.5.2.1 Measurement system description

Measurement system description is captured in clause 7.2.1.

#### 9.5.2.2 Test procedure

##### 9.5.2.2.1 Stage 1: Calibration

Calibration procedure for the Indoor Anechoic Chamber is captured in
clause 8.2.

##### 9.5.2.2.2 Stage 2: BS measurement

Reference IAC testing procedure in clause 9.2.2.2.2 (i.e. EIRP accuracy
measurement procedure for Normal test conditions) where the appropriate
measurement is:

The appropriate test parameter in steps 5 - 7 for the output power
dynamics vary depending on the specific measurement as described for the
conducted measurement in TS 37.145-1 \[21\] in each case however the
EIRP measurement is made on both polarisations and added as follows:

EIRP~meas\_p(x)~ = P~meas\_p(x)~ + L~A~→~B~

and

EIRP~meas~ = EIRP~meas\_p1~ + EIRP~meas\_p2~

where the declared beam is the measured signal for any two orthogonal
polarizations (denoted p1 and p2).

Furthermore, the measurement is performed twice; once with the BS
transmitting at P~rated,c,EIRP~ on all PRBs and then a second time with
the BS transmitting on a single PRB. Both measurements are made in the
same conformance direction in the same calibrated test setup. The ratio
of these two EIRP levels is used to assess compliance for the OTA total
power dynamic range.

#### 9.5.2.3 MU value derivation, FR1

As the output power dynamics are relative measurements most of the
uncertainties form the EIRP accuracy cancel out as the same error will
be applied to both of the measured OTA signals.

This includes all calibration errors, misalignment errors, impedance
mismatch and mutual coupling.

As the both the measured OTA signal will have the same beam pattern
quiet zone errors, phase curvature errors also can be expected to be the
same for both signals.

The uncertainty budget descriptions are the same as those in
clause 9.2.2.3 with the addition descriptions in table 9.5.2.3-1.

The MU uncertainty assessment is shown in table 9.5.2.3-1, zero values
have been omitted in the table for the sake of space, but still be
considered as part of the budget.

##### 9.5.3.2.2 Stage 2: BS measurement

Reference CATR measurement procedure in clause 9.2.3.2.2 where in step 6
the appropriate measurement is:

The appropriate test parameter in step 6 for the output power dynamics
vary depending on the specific measurement as described for the
conducted measurement in each case however the EIRP measurement is made
on both polarisations and added as follows:

EIRP~meas\_p(x)~ = P~meas\_p(x)~ + L~A~→~B~.

and

EIRP~meas~ = EIRP~meas\_p1~ + EIRP~meas\_p2~

where the declared beam is the measured signal for any two orthogonal
polarizations (denoted p1 and p2).

Furthermore, the measurement is performed twice; once with the BS
transmitting at P~rated,c,EIRP~ on all PRBs (in case of NR) and then a
second time with the BS transmitting on a single PRB. Both measurements
are made in the same conformance direction in the same calibrated test
setup. The ratio of these two EIRP levels is used to assess compliance
for the OTA total power dynamic range.

#### 9.5.3.3 MU value derivation, FR1

As the output power dynamics are relative measurements most of the
uncertainties form the EIRP accuracy cancel out as the same error will
be applied to both of the measured OTA signals.

This includes all calibration errors, misalignment errors, impedance
mismatch and mutual coupling.

As the both the measured OTA signal will have the same beam pattern
quiet zone errors, phase curvature errors also can be expected to be the
same for both signals.

The uncertainty budget descriptions are the same as those in
clause 9.2.3.2.2 with the addition descriptions in table 9.5.3.3-1.

The MU uncertainty assessment is shown in table 9.5.3.3-1, zero values

considered as part of the budget.

### 9.5.6 Maximum accepted test system uncertainty

Maximum test system uncertainties derivation methodology was described
in clause 5.1. The maximum accepted test system uncertainty values was
derived based on test system specific values.

According to the methodology referred above, the common maximum accepted
test system uncertainty values for the OTA output power dynamics tests
can be derived from values captured in tables 9.5.6-1 to 9.5.6-5,
separately for each of the defined frequency ranges. The common maximum
values are applicable for all test methods addressing certain OTA output
power dynamics test requirement. Based on the input values, the expanded
uncertainty *u~e~* (1.96σ - confidence interval of 95 %) values were
derived.

The output power dynamic range MU for FR1 for up to 4.2 GHz was agreed
to be the same as for eAAS WI. It is expected that the measurement
chamber setup, calibration and measurement procedures and the MU budget
will be identical for E-UTRA and NR.

Furthermore, for the frequency range 4.2 -- 6 GHz, the chamber and
instrument uncertainties are the same as those for the frequency range 3
-- 4.2 GHz, assuming testing of a BS designed for operation in licensed
spectrum. The MU value was agreed to be ± 0.4 dB for all bands up to
6 GHz.

For FR2: Similarly to FR1, since the OTA output power dynamic range
requirement is a relative measurement, only the test equipment
uncertainty is of importance. Based on expected test equipment
uncertainty, the output power dynamic range MU for FR2 was decided to be
± 0.4 dB (same as for FR1).

### 9.5.7 Test Tolerance for OTA output power dynamics

9.6 OTA transmitted signal quality: Frequency error
---------------------------------------------------

### 9.6.1 General

Clause 9.6 captures MU and TT values derivation for the OTA frequency
error directional requirement.

Frequency error is the measure of the difference between the actual BS
transmit frequency and the assigned frequency. The same source shall be
used for RF frequency and data clock generation.

Frequency error is not affected by any time or frequency varying
amplitude errors. It is possible that some aspects of the OTA
environment may impact the signal fidelity; for example, ripple in a
quiet zone relates to reflections in the chamber and may create a
frequency specific ripple. It is not expected that such effects would
have any significant impact on the frequency error As long as the signal
is large enough the only measurement uncertainty will be associated with
the measurement equipment. It is important that considering the chamber
path loss and gain of the measurement antenna and equipment, the test
equipment is provided with a sufficient RX power level. As a guide,
measurement equipment vendors quote EVM accuracy down to approx. -20 dBm
input power for E-UTRA signals.

Few typical BS output power levels and antenna arrangements for
different BS classes are captured in table 9.6.1-1:

Table 9.6.1-1: Typical BS output power levels

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  BS class   Pout (dBm)   G\_AAS (dBi)   L\_ant\   d\_FF\   FSPL\   G\_RX (dBi)   P\_RX (dBm)
                                         (m)       (m)      (dB)                  
  ---------- ------------ -------------- --------- -------- ------- ------------- -------------
  WA BS      43           17             1         13.33    60.96   9             8.04

  MR BS      38           9              0.5       6.67     54.94   9             1.06

  LA BS      24           5              0.2       2.67     46.98   9             -8.98
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It can be seen that there is considerable margin over -20 dBm for the
received power level, so it seems unlikely that this will cause any
measurement problems.

As the OTA test system is not expected to substantially affect the
measurement accuracy for frequency error the existing conducted MU can
be used.

In this case, however testing should be carried out in the OTA
conformance reference direction, not the *beam peak direction* of the
*OTA peak directions set* reference direction.

#### 9.6.2.3 MU value derivation

The uncertainty in the power accuracy of the OTA test chamber will not
affect the frequency error uncertainty.

Possible phase variation in the chamber due to variation in the signal

##### 9.6.3.2.2 Stage 2: BS measurement

As the frequency error is tested together with EVM, the CATR measurement
procedure is same with EVM as in clause 9.7.3. The CATR testing
procedure consists of the following steps:

1\) Align BS with boresight of range antenna.

2\) Configure TX branch and carrier according to required test
configuration.

3\) Measure frequency error of each carrier arriving at the measurement
equipment (such as a spectrum analyzer or equivalent instrument).

4\) Repeat steps 2 - 3 for all conformance test direction as declared by

pre-condition of reference clock synchronized between measurement system
with RF frequency signal.

#### 9.6.3.3 MU value derivation

##### 9.6.5.2.1 Stage 1: Calibration

Calibration procedure for the Plane Wave Synthesizer is captured in
clause 8.6.

##### 9.6.5.2.2 Stage 2: BS measurement

As the frequency error is tested together with EVM, the PWS measurement
procedure is same with EVM as in clause 9.7.5. The PWS testing procedure
consists of the following steps:

1\) Align BS with boresight of range antenna.

2\) Configure TX branch and carrier according to required test
configuration.

3\) Measure frequency error of each carrier arriving at the measurement
equipment (such as a spectrum analyzer or equivalent instrument).

4\) Repeat steps 2 - 3 for all conformance test direction as declared by
the manufacturer in TS 37.145-2 \[4\] or TS 38.141-2 \[6\].

5\) Repeat steps 2 - 4 for all applicable conformance test models.

NOTE: All the discussions above are based on the measurement
pre-condition of reference clock synchronized between measurement system
with RF frequency signal.

#### 9.6.5.3 MU value derivation

The uncertainty in the power accuracy of the OTA test chamber will not
affect the frequency error uncertainty.

Possible phase variation in the chamber due to variation in the signal
BW is not significant to affect the frequency error measurement
uncertainty.

The conducted MU value is adopted for the OTA MU.

### 9.6.6 Maximum accepted test system uncertainty

The uncertainty in the power accuracy of the OTA test chamber will not
affect the frequency error uncertainty.

Possible phase variation in the chamber due to variation in the signal
BW is not significant to affect the frequency error measurement
uncertainty. The frequency error MU is ±12 Hz.

The MU for FR1 for frequency error for up to 4.2 GHz was agreed to be
the same as for eAAS WI. It is expected that the measurement chamber
setup, calibration and measurement procedures and the MU budget will be
identical for E-UTRA and NR.

Furthermore, for the frequency range 4.2 -- 6 GHz, the chamber and
instrument uncertainties are the same as those for the frequency range 3
-- 4.2 GHz, assuming testing of a BS designed for operation in licensed
spectrum.

For FR2, similarly to FR1, as long as the link budget is sufficient to
provide a signal at the test equipment that is within its operating
range, then the signal quality requirements MU depends only on the test
equipment MU. In the beam center, for a CATR, there is sufficient link
budget and thus the MU was decided based on expected test equipment
performance.

The MU values are ± 12 Hz for frequency error.

Considering the methodology described in clause 5.1, Test Tolerance
values for frequency error were derived based on values captured in

The TT values were agreed to be the same as the MU values.

Frequency range specific Test Tolerance values for the frequency error
test are defined in table 9.6.7-1.

9.7 OTA transmitted signal quality: EVM
---------------------------------------

### 9.7.1 General

Clause 9.7 captures MU and TT values derivation for the OTA EVM
directional requirement.

The Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) is defined as measure of the difference
between the ideal symbols and the measured symbols after the
equalization. This difference is called the error vector. The equaliser
parameters are defined in appropriate annex of TS 37.145-2 \[4\], or
TS 38.141-2 \[6\]. The EVM result is defined as the square root of the
ratio of the mean error vector power to the mean reference power
expressed in percent.

Although EVM is represented as a % it can also be thought of as a
relative power ratio in dBc, when looked at as a power ratio the effect
of potential amplitude errors in the OTA chamber can be seen.

height="2.7916666666666665in"}

Figure 6.7.1-1: Example of EVM as a power ratio in dB

In the example the co-channel noise is 45 dBc which equates to an EVM of
0.56 %, if the measurement system were to alter the ratio between the
wanted signal and the co-channel signal then this would affect the EVM
result in %.

##### 9.7.2.2.1 Stage 1: Calibration

Calibration procedure for the Indoor Anechoic Chamber is captured in
clause 8.2.

##### 9.7.2.2.2 Stage 2: BS measurement

Reference IAC measurement procedure in clause 9.2.2.2.2 (i.e. EIRP
accuracy measurement procedure for Normal test conditions) where in
steps 5 - 7 measure the EVM for the applicable test case and the
specific test models. In this case, however testing should be carried
out in the OTA conformance reference direction, not the *beam peak
direction* of the *OTA peak directions* *set* reference direction.

#### 9.7.2.3 MU value derivation, FR1

As both the wanted signal and the noise signal are at the same frequency
they will be measured at the same time the requirement is effectively
differential and most of the OTA chamber errors will cancel out.

The wanted signal will be beam formed and hence the errors used for the
EIRP accuracy will be valid, however the co-channel noise may not be
beam formed and hence could suffer different errors due to the chamber
quite zone, and phase profile. These items are included in both the
calibration error and the measurement error, as the requirement is
differential if there is a difference between the wanted and the
unwanted it will only be due to the measurement phase. The calibration
errors will cancel as calibration is only done one so they will be the
same for both wanted and unwanted signals.

Potentially, the EVM may vary in space due to different patterns of
wanted signal and distortion. Thus for narrow beams, it may be possible
that beam pointing and alignment errors could impact EVM results.

As EVM is also dependent on the phase of the calibrated path it is
possible that phase ripple in the quite zone or elsewhere, which arises
due to multipath reflections, may lead to frequency ripple and cause
additional EVM errors which do not appear in a power accuracy analysis
as done for EIRP accuracy.

The potential impacts of both beam pointing misalignment and scattering
within the chamber on the received waveform and measurement accuracy
were investigated. The potential deviation in the measured EVM arising
from beam pointing errors was examined considering a worst case
scenario, in which variation in space of EVM is maximal due to the ideal
signal being correlated and the distortion uncorrelated; hence the
impact of misalignment error would be the difference between array gain
and element gain. Even in this circumstance, alignment errors of several
degrees would not lead to a significant error in the measured EVM.
Considering all likely chamber sizes, for E-UTRA any scattering would
fall within the cyclic prefix of the OFDM symbol and hence not cause
ISI. Furthermore, the likely delay spread of any scattering would relate
to coherence bandwidths much larger than any UTRA/E-UTRA channel
bandwidth. Even if the scattered energy would cause interference, the
interference level would anyhow not lead to a significant EVM increase.
Thus it was concluded that the impact scattering within the measurement
chamber would be negligible.

indicated in table 9.7.2.3-1:

The indoor anechoic chamber budget is carried out without consideration
of the measurement equipment as this MU is given in %, converting to dB
gives, for example:

2% is equivalent to 20\*log~10~(2/100) = -33.98 dB

If the unwanted signal is 0.25 dB higher than the wanted due to the test
system then this will be degraded to -33.73 dB, and

-33.73 dB is equivalent to: 10^(-33.73/20)^ \*100 = 2.06 %

Additional error due to potential phase error has not been considered
however the potential increase due to then OTA test equipment is well
within the contribution allowable with a 1 % linear MU.

NOTE: Analysis of the phase uncertainties indicates that the
contributions are not significant to affect the final MU value, however
if future work indicates that phase or any other errors not related to
amplitude calibration may affect the EVM measurement uncertainty the MU
analysis may be re-examined.

##### 9.7.4.2.2 Stage 2: BS measurement

The NFTR testing procedure consists of the following steps:

1\. Align the BS with (Theta, Phi) angles corresponding to the declared
conformance direction to be measured.

2\. Configure TX beamforming and carrier according to the
manufacturer\'s declared rated output power.

3\. Set the BS to transmit the test signal according to the applicable

4\. Measure OTA EVM of each carrier arriving at the measurement

6\. Repeat steps 3 - 5 for other applicable test models.

For conformance tests, EVM shall be measured at maximum and minimum
power settings while frequency error, and occupied BW at only maximum
power setting.

#### 9.7.4.3 MU value derivation, FR1

EVM is a relative measurement given that the wanted signal and noise
signal are at the same frequency and measured at the same time therefore
most of the OTA anechoic chamber errors will cancel out.

Nearly all of uncertainty terms for the EVM measurement and EVM
calibration are the same and hence EVM is a differential or relative
measurement.

Potentially, the EVM may vary in space due to different patterns of
wanted signal and distortion. Thus for narrow beams, it may be possible
that beam pointing and alignment errors could impact EVM results. The
importance and impact of such effects is likely to be even smaller than
for far field based measurements.

As EVM is also dependent on the phase of the calibrated path it is
possible that phase ripple in the quiet zone or elsewhere, which arises
due to multipath reflections, may lead to frequency ripple and cause
additional EVM errors which do not appear in a power accuracy analysis
as done for EIRP accuracy. Analysis of the effect of such effects is
that the effects will be even smaller than for far field based
measurements.

The Near Field budget is carried out without consideration of the
measurement equipment therefore the MU is given in % and can be
converted to dB, for example:

2% is equivalent to 20\*log~10~(2/100) = -33.98 dB

If the unwanted signal is 0.35 dB higher than the wanted due to the test
system then this will be degraded to -33.63 dB, and

-33.63 dB is equivalent to: 10^(-33.63/20)^ \*100 = 2.08%

Additional error due to potential phase error has not been considered
however the potential increase due to then OTA test equipment is well
within the contribution allowable with a 1% linear MU.

For Near Field Test Range a new measurement uncertainty term shall be
added to the MU. This term will take into account the fact that in Near
Field the phase pattern will sum up so that the signal level is
increasing while the noise level is the same. This MU term will only
cause an error in the direction of increasing the reported EVM value and
not decreasing it, and will depend on the implementation of the BS.

NOTE: Analysis of the phase uncertainties indicates that the
contributions are not significant enough to affect the final MU value,
however if future work indicates that phase or any other errors not
related to amplitude calibration may affect the EVM measurement
uncertainty, the MU analysis may need to be re-examined.

the appropriate measurement parameter is the EVM for the applicable test
case and the specific test models. In this case, however testing should
be carried out in the *OTA coverage range* reference direction and *OTA
coverage range* maximum directions.

#### 9.7.5.3 MU value derivation, FR1

As both the wanted signal and the noise signal are at the same frequency
they will be measured at the same time the requirement is effectively
differential and most of the OTA chamber errors will cancel out.

The wanted signal will be beam formed and hence the errors used for the
EIRP accuracy will be valid, however the co-channel noise may not be
beam formed and hence could suffer different errors due to the chamber
quite zone, and phase profile. These items are included in both the
calibration error and the measurement error, as the requirement is
differential if there is a difference between the wanted and the
unwanted it will only be due to the measurement phase. The calibration
errors will cancel as calibration is only done one so they will be the
same for both wanted and unwanted signals.

Potentially, the EVM may vary in space due to different patterns of
wanted signal and distortion. Thus for narrow beams, it may be possible
that beam pointing and alignment errors could impact EVM results.

As EVM is also dependent on the phase of the calibrated path it is
possible that phase ripple in the quite zone or elsewhere, which arises
due to multipath reflections, may lead to frequency ripple and cause
additional EVM errors which do not appear in a power accuracy analysis
as done for EIRP accuracy.

The potential impacts of both beam pointing misalignment and scattering
within the chamber on the received waveform and measurement accuracy
were investigated. The potential deviation in the measured EVM arising
from beam pointing errors was examined considering a worst case
scenario, in which variation in space of EVM is maximal due to the ideal
signal being correlated and the distortion uncorrelated; hence the
impact of misalignment error would be the difference between array gain
and element gain. Even in this circumstance, alignment errors of several
degrees would not lead to a significant error in the measured EVM.
Considering all likely chamber sizes, for E-UTRA any scattering would
fall within the cyclic prefix of the OFDM symbol and hence not cause
ISI. Furthermore, the likely delay spread of any scattering would relate
to coherence bandwidths much larger than any UTRA/E-UTRA channel
bandwidth. Even if the scattered energy would cause interference, the
interference level would anyhow not lead to a significant EVM increase.
Thus it was concluded that the impact scattering within the measurement
chamber would be negligible.

indicated in table 9.7.5.3-1:

The PWS budget is carried out without consideration of the measurement
equipment as this MU is given in %, converting to dB gives, for example:

2% is equivalent to 20\*log~10~(2/100) = -33.98 dB

If the unwanted signal is 0.5 dB higher than the wanted due to the test
system then this will be degraded to -33.48 dB, and

-33.48 dB is equivalent to: 10^(-33.48/20)^ \*100 = 2.12%

Additional error due to potential phase error has not been considered
however the potential increase due to then OTA test equipment is well
within the contribution allowable with a 1% linear MU.

NOTE: Analysis of the phase uncertainties indicates that the
contributions are not significant to affect the final MU value, however
if future work indicates that phase or any other errors not related to
amplitude calibration may affect the EVM measurement uncertainty the MU
analysis may be re-examined.

### 9.7.6 Maximum accepted test system uncertainty

Without consideration of any phase uncertainty, the amplitude error
analysis shows the conducted MU of 1% can be maintained for the OTA MU
(subject to the clarification noted in the limitations clause that the
reported EVM may be greater than the real EVM due to the difference
between near field and far field EVM values. The extent of such a
difference is dependent on the architecture of the BS).

NOTE: Analysis of the phase uncertainties indicates that the
contributions are not significant to affect the final MU value, however
if future work indicates that phase or any other errors not related to
amplitude calibration may affect the EVM measurement uncertainty the MU
analysis may be re-examined.

The MU for FR1 for EVM below 4.2 GHz was agreed to be the same as for
eAAS WI. It is expected that the measurement chamber setup, calibration
and measurement procedures and the MU budget will be identical for
E-UTRA and NR.

Furthermore, for the frequency range 4.2 -- 6 GHz, the chamber and
instrument uncertainties are the same as those for the frequency range 3
-- 4.2 GHz, assuming testing of a BS designed for operation in licensed
spectrum.

For FR2, similarly to FR1, as long as the link budget is sufficient to
provide a signal at the test equipment that is within its operating
range, then the signal quality requirements MU depends only on the test
equipment MU. In the beam center, for a CATR, there is sufficient link
budget and thus the MU was decided based on expected test equipment
performance.

The MU values are 1% for EVM.

An overview of the MU values for all the requirements is captured in
clause 17.

### 9.7.7 Test Tolerance for EVM

Considering the methodology described in clause 5.1, Test Tolerance
values for EVM were derived based on values captured in clause 9.7.6.

The TT values were agreed to be the same as the MU values.

Frequency range specific Test Tolerance values for the EVM test are
defined in table 9.7.7-1.

9.8 OTA transmitted signal quality: TAE
---------------------------------------

### 9.8.1 General

Clause 9.8 captures MU and TT values derivation for the OTA TAE
directional requirement.

TAE is the timing difference between 2 modulated signals, either TX
diversity, MIMO or CA carriers. Conducted TAE is measured as follows:

![](media/image105.emf){width="5.284722222222222in"
height="1.7013888888888888in"}

Figure 9.8.1-1: Conducted TAE measurement set up

As the conducted signals are combined before being input to the test
equipment the OTA test is simple to implement.

![](media/image106.emf){width="5.284722222222222in"
height="1.1041666666666667in"}

Figure 9.8.1-2: OTA TAE measurement set up

The OTA signals are both transmitted from the BS and added at the test
receive antenna. As the test paths for the 2 signals are identical there
are no additional timing errors added to the test system compared to the
conducted test system.

As the TAE requirement is a measure of timing difference it is not
affected by the accuracy of the test system amplitude calibration and
measurement uncertainties.

As long as the signals fed into the measurement equipment are of a
sufficient amplitude then the only measurement uncertainty will be that
of the measurement equipment itself.

The measurement equipment requires a level of \> -20 dBm to accurately
carry out the TAE.

As the requirement is done for the wanted beam at full power, even for
low power BS it is not anticipated the received test signal will be
lower than -10 dBm.

There may be a tiny impact to signal fidelity due to scattering in the
chamber, however this will be insignificant and is not expected to
impact TAE.

As the OTA test system does not affect the measurement accuracy for TAE
the existing conducted MU can be used.

#### 9.8.4A.3 MU value derivation

The uncertainty in the power accuracy of the OTA test chamber will not
affect the TAE measurement uncertainty.

Possible phase variation in the chamber due to variation in the signal
BW is not significant to affect the TAE measurement uncertainty.

The conducted MU value is adopted for the OTA MU.

### 9.8.5 Maximum accepted test system uncertainty

The uncertainty in the power accuracy of the OTA test chamber will not
affect the TAE measurement uncertainty.

Possible phase variation in the chamber due to variation in the signal
BW is not significant to affect the TAE measurement uncertainty.

The conducted MU value is adopted for the OTA MU, and is ±25 ns.

The MU for FR1 for TAE up to 4.2 GHz was agreed to be the same as for
eAAS WI. It is expected that the measurement chamber setup, calibration
and measurement procedures and the MU budget will be identical for
E-UTRA and NR.

Furthermore, for the frequency range 4.2 -- 6 GHz, the chamber and
instrument uncertainties are the same as those for the frequency range 3
-- 4.2 GHz, assuming testing of a BS designed for operation in licensed
spectrum.

For FR2, similarly to FR1, as long as the link budget is sufficient to
provide a signal at the test equipment that is within its operating
range, then the signal quality requirements MU depends only on the test
equipment MU. In the beam center, for a CATR, there is sufficient link
budget and thus the MU was decided based on expected test equipment
performance.

The MU values are 25 ns for time alignment error.

9.9 OTA occupied bandwidth
--------------------------

### 9.9.1 General

Clause 9.9 captures MU and TT values derivation for the OTA occupied
bandwidth directional requirement.

It is defined as the occupied bandwidth is the width of a frequency band
such that, below the lower and above the upper frequency limits, the
mean powers emitted are each equal to a specified percentage β/2 of the
total mean transmitted power.

Occupied BW is specified in Hz.

It is measured by taking a number of narrow band power measurements
across the modulated BW and finding the half power level and hence the
frequency points which correspond to the half power level. The
measurement is effectively a differential measurement as total power and
hence half power is found from the measured data.

The only effect the measurement chamber would have on the accuracy of
the measurement were if the frequency response of the chamber were not
flat, however a 40 MHz BW is unlikely to introduce any significant
frequency ripple in a RF chamber (40 MHz is 4% of 1 GHz) so this effect
can be ignored.

The largest error it is due to the number of measurement points taken,
looking at the gap between points compared to the conducted MU:

The MU is 3 to 4 time larger than the distance between the measurement
points. Which allows the estimation of the 3dB point to be 1.5 to 2
steps out on each side of the modulated band width.

As the OTA system will not introduce any additional frequency error and
it will not introduce any additional differential amplitude error, the
MU for the OTA measurement should be the same as for the conducted
requirement.

It should be noted that the signal power level at the bandwidth edge
required for meeting the OBW requirement is in general at least 20dB
higher than the level that is required to meet unwanted emissions
requirements. Thus there is very substantial room to accommodate
measurement uncertainty for the OBW requirement.

### 9.9.6 Maximum accepted test system uncertainty

For E-UTRA, the OTA occupied BW MU is the same as the conducted MU and
is as follows:

\- 1.4 MHz, 3 MHz Channel BW: 30 kHz

\- 5 MHz, 10 MHz Channel BW: 100 kHz

\- 15 MHz, ≥20 MHz: Channel BW: 300 kHz

For NR in FR1, the MU for the OTA occupied bandwidth depends on the
roll-off of the transmitted signal and the instrument MU, not on the OTA
chamber related MU. In principle, the occupied bandwidth MU was agreed
to be the same as for E-UTRA. However NR covers larger BS channel
bandwidths than E-UTRA, and thus additional MU relating to larger
channel bandwidths were estimated. The MU was decided based on the
density of power measurements within the channel bandwidth and the
expected test instrument performance.

For NR in FR1, the MU was agreed to be:

± 100 kHz for BS channel bandwidths up to 10 MHz,

± 300 kHz for 10 MHz \< BS channel bandwidth ≤ 50 MHz, and

± 300 kHz for 50 MHz \< BS channel bandwidths ≤ 100 MHz.

For NR in FR2, based on expected test equipment performance, the MU for
occupied bandwidth was decided to be:

± 600 kHz (same as for FR1 for channel bandwidths greater than 50 MHz).

For NR in FR2, similarly to FR1, as long as the link budget is
sufficient to provide a signal at the test equipment that is within its
operating range, then the occupied bandwidth MU depends only on the test
equipment MU. In the beam center, for a CATR, there is sufficient link
budget and thus the MU was decided based on expected test equipment
performance, considering the agreed density of power measurements in the
frequency domain.

An overview of the MU values for all the requirements is captured in
clause 17.

### 9.9.7 Test Tolerance for OTA occupied bandwidth

Considering the methodology described in clause 5.1, Test Tolerance
values for OTA occupied bandwidth were derived based on values captured
in clause 9.9.6.

Frequency range specific Test Tolerance values for the OTA occupied
bandwidth test are defined in tables 9.9.7-1 and 9.9.7-2.

power and transmitter transient period directional requirements in FR2.

TS 38.141-2, clause 6.5.2.4.2.1 with FR2 specific procedure steps in
TS 38.141-2, clause 6.5.2.4.2.3.

#### 9.10.2.3 MU value derivation, FR2

The MU assessment was carried out using a CATR chamber only. However
other chamber types are not precluded if suitable MU assessment is done.

The CATR test setup and calibration and measurement procedures for FR2
are expected to be similar to those of FR1, although the test chamber
dimensions and associated MU values will scale due to the shorter
wavelengths and larger relative array apertures. However, it is noted
that in order to achieve the test instrument uncertainties that were
assumed, calibration of the spectrum analyzer may be needed.

### 9.10.3 Maximum accepted test system uncertainty

The MU assessment was carried out using a CATR chamber only. However
other chamber types are not precluded if suitable MU assessment is done.

Table 9.10.3-1: Maximum accepted test system uncertainty values for the
EIRP accuracy, FR2

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    24.25 \< f \< 29.5 GHz   37 \< f \< 43.5 GHz   43.5 \< f \< 48.2 GHz

  NOTE: MU estimation for 43.5 \< f \< 48.2 GHz was derived based on the linear approximation (based on MU values for lower frequency ranges). MU extrapolation approach was used instead of the typical derivation of the Expanded MU based on the MU budget calculations, as in case of lower frequency ranges.                                                  

### 9.10.4 Test Tolerance for OTA TX OFF power and transmitter transient period

Considering the methodology described in clause 5.1, Test Tolerance
values for OTA TX OFF power and transmitter transient period were
derived based on values captured in clause 9.10.3.

The TT value was agreed to be the same as the MU.

Frequency range specific Test Tolerance values for the OTA TX OFF power
and transmitter transient period test are defined in table 9.10.4-1.

Table 9.10.4-1: Test Tolerance values for the EIRP accuracy, FR2

                        24.25 \< f \< 29.5 GHz   37 \< f \< 43.5 GHz   43.5 \< f \< 48.2 GHz

An overview of the TT values for all the requirements is captured in
clause 18.

10 RX directional requirements
==============================

10.1 General
------------

RX in-band directional requirements all use a wanted signal at a
specified EIS power level and throughput/BER quality metric.
Requirements which also include an in-band interferer have the wanted
signal and the interferer coming from the same direction within the
specified RoAoA.

For simplicity since OTA requirements do not all use the same
RAT-specific test models nor the same reference measurement channels,
the OTA test procedures have been kept general by using \"applicable
test signal\" and \"applicable reference measurement channel\" where the
RAT-specific test model and reference measurement channels can be found
in AAS BS or NR BS test specifications TS 37.145-2 \[4\] and
TS 38.141-2 \[6\].

NOTE 1: All the calibration and test procedures are valid for FR1 as
well as FR2, unless otherwise stated.

NOTE 2: All the MU and TT values derivations are valid for Normal test
conditions, unless otherwise stated.

For wanted signal frequency above 4.2 GHz in FR1 (4.2 GHz \< f ≤ 6 GHz),
it has been agreed that MU are obtained as:

$\text{MU}_{\text{EIS}4.2 - 6\text{GHz}} = \sqrt{\text{MU}_{\text{EIS}3 - 4.2\text{GHz}}^{2} - \text{MU}_{\text{TestEquipment}3 - 4.2\text{GHz}}^{2} + \text{MU}_{\text{TestEquipment}4.2 - 6\text{GHz}}^{2} - \text{MU}_{\text{Matching}3 - 4.2\text{GHz}}^{2} + \text{MU}_{\text{Matching}4.2 - 6\text{GHz}}^{2}}$

$\text{MU}_{\text{conductedwanted}4.2 - 6\text{GHz}} = \sqrt{\text{MU}_{\text{conductedwanted}3 - 4.2\text{GHz}}^{2} - \text{MU}_{\text{TestEquipment}3 - 4.2\text{GHz}}^{2} + \text{MU}_{\text{TestEquipment}4.2 - 6\text{GHz}}^{2} - \text{MU}_{\text{Matching}3 - 4.2\text{GHz}}^{2} + \text{MU}_{\text{Matching}4.2 - 6\text{GHz}}^{2}}$

$\text{MU}_{\text{conductedint}4.2 - 6\text{GHz}} = \sqrt{\text{MU}_{\text{conductedint}3 - 4.2\text{GHz}}^{2} - \text{MU}_{\text{TestEquipment}3 - 4.2\text{GHz}}^{2} + \text{MU}_{\text{TestEquipment}4.2 - 6\text{GHz}}^{2} - \text{MU}_{\text{Matching}3 - 4.2\text{GHz}}^{2} + \text{MU}_{\text{Matching}4.2 - 6\text{GHz}}^{2}}$

With

$\text{MU}_{\text{TestEquipment}4.2 - 6\text{GHz}}(1.96\sigma) =$ 1.96
$\times \ $0.58

And

$\text{MU}_{\text{Matching}4.2 - 6\text{GHz}}(1.96\sigma) =$ 1.96
$\times \ $0.28

10.2 OTA sensitivity

### 10.2.1 General

Clause 10.2 captures MU and TT values derivation for the OTA sensitivity
directional requirement.

### 10.2.2 Indoor Anechoic Chamber

#### 10.2.2.1 Measurement system description

Measurement system description is captured in clause 7.2.1.

#### 10.2.2.2 Test procedure

##### 10.2.2.2.1 Stage 1: Calibration

Calibration procedure for the Indoor Anechoic Chamber is captured in
clause 8.2 with the calibration system setup for RX requirements
depicted in figure 8.2-2.

##### 10.2.2.2.2 Stage 2: BS measurement

The IAC testing procedure consists of the following steps:

1\) Uninstall the reference antenna and install the BS with its
manufacturer declared coordinate system reference point in the same
place as the phase centre of the reference antenna. The manufacturer
declared coordinate system orientation of the BS is set to be aligned
with testing system.

2\) Set the BS to be satisfied with the *sensitivity RoAoA* covering
conformance testing receiving direction.

3\) Rotate the BS to make the conformance testing receiving direction
aligned with the *beam peak direction* of the reference antenna at the
calibration stage.

4\) For FDD, start BS transmission using applicable test model at
manufacturer\'s declared rated output power.

5\) Set the test signal mean power at the RF signal source generator as
the declared minimum EIS level plus L~cal,\ A→D~ (as defined in
clause 8.2) and applicable reference measurement channel .

6\) Measure the throughput.

7\) Repeat the above steps 2 \~ 6 per conformance testing direction.

##### 10.2.3.2.2 Stage 2: BS measurement

The CATR testing procedure consists of the following steps:

1\) Set up BS in place of SGH from calibration stage. Align BS with
*beam peak direction* of range antenna.

2\) Configure signal generator, one port (polarization) and one carrier
at a time according to maximum power requirement.

3\) Start with signal level at sensitivity level using applicable test
model.

4\) Calculate EIS per port (polarization) at this point with EIS = PBER
- L~A→B~.

5\) Repeat steps 2 - 4 for all conformance test *beam direction pairs*.

#### 10.2.4.1 Measurement system description

Measurement system description is captured in clause 7.4.1.

#### 10.2.4.2 Test procedure

##### 10.2.4.2.1 Stage 1: Calibration

Calibration procedure for the One Dimensional Compact Range is captured
in clause 8.4.

##### 10.2.4.2.2 Stage 2: BS measurement

The 1D CATR testing procedure consists of the following steps:

1\) Connect the feed system of the compact probe to the signal
generator.

2\) Calibrate the test range, using a reference antenna with standard
gain installed in the quiet zone of the probe and measure the path loss
between signal generator and reference antenna.

3\) Position the BS in the quiet zone of the probe with its manufacturer
declared coordinate system reference point in the same place as the
phase centre of the reference antenna. The manufacturer declared
coordinate system orientation of the BS is set to be aligned with
testing system.

4\) Connect the BS to the measurement equipment.

5\) Align with the conformance test direction.

6\) Set the signal generator to the manufacturer declared sensitivity
(EIS) level plus the measured path loss.

7\) Measure the throughput and BER of the BS.

8\) Repeat test steps 2 - 7 for all declared beams and corresponding
conformance steering directions.

##### 10.2.5.2.1 Stage 1: Calibration

Calibration procedure for the Near Field Test Range is captured in
clause 8.5.

##### 10.2.5.2.2 Stage 2: BS measurement

The NFTR testing procedure consists in the following steps:

1\) BS near field *radiation pattern* measurement: this is performed
when the BS will be receiving a defined modulated signal, as defined in
applicable conformance test specification.

NOTE: if the Near Field pattern is derived, for example by transmitting
through the *antenna array*, then uncertainty contributors need to be
considered in the measurement uncertainty budget (including differences
in matching losses between transmit and receive chains).

2\) BS near field OTA sensitivity measurement: this is performed by
measuring the sensitivity in near field when a modulated signal is
received by the BS under test,

3\) BS near field to far field EIS transformation: sensitivity
measurement is applied.

The near field to far field transformation is a mathematical computation
which is applied to the near field measured *radiation pattern* in order
to compute the far field *radiation pattern*. It is typically performed
expanding the measured near field over a set of orthogonal basis
functions. The near to far field transform is then performed in two
steps:

3.1) Expansion (or projection) of the measured near field (i.e.
*E~meas~I*) over a set of orthogonal basis functions (i.e. *F~baI~(r)*)
in order to evaluate the transformed spectrum:

*I~eas~(r) = Spectrum \* F~basis~(r)*

3.2) FF (i.e. E~FF~) computation using the previously calculated
spectrum and with the basis functions evaluated at r∞ (i.e. *F~basis~(r
∞)*):

*E~FF~ = Spectrum \* F~basis~(r ∞)*

When performing the near field to far field transformation, the
sensitivity measurement is applied so that the near field pattern will
be transformed from relative power (i.e. dB) to absolute power (i.e.
dBm). In this specific case, the EIS far field pattern is expressed in
terms of the absolute power received by the BS.

4\) BS OTA sensitivity: once the full 3D far field EIS pattern has been
computed in step 3 from measurements in step 2, the OTA sensitivity can
be derived.

##### 10.2.6.2.2 Stage 2: BS measurement

The PWS testing procedure consists of the following steps:

1\) Install BS as BS with the manufacturer declared coordinate system
reference point in the same place as the phase center of the reference
antenna A as shown in figure 7.6.1-2. The manufacturer declared
coordinate system orientation of the BS is set to be aligned with the
testing system.

2\) Configure signal generator, one port and one carrier at a time
according to maximum power requirement.

3\) Calculate EIS at this point with EIS = PBER - L~C→A~.

4\) Repeat steps 2 - 3 for all conformance test *beam direction pairs*
and test conditions.

10.3 OTA reference sensitivity
------------------------------

The OTA REFSENS requirement is intended to ensure the OTA reference
sensitivity level for a declared *OTA REFSENS RoAoA*.

The OTA reference sensitivity power level EIS~REFSENS~ is the mean power
received at the radiated interface at which a reference performance
requirement shall be met for a specified reference measurement channel.

The measurement methods, along with the corresponding calibration,
procedure and MU assessment, are the same as those for the OTA
sensitivity requirement in clause 10.2, except that the required level
is EIS~REFSENS~ in the measurement procedure.

10.4 OTA dynamic range
----------------------

### 10.4.1 General

Clause 10.4 captures MU and TT values derivation for the OTA dynamic
range directional requirement.

The OTA dynamic range is a measure of the capability of the receiver
unit to receive a wanted signal in the presence of an interfering signal
inside the received *channel bandwidth* or the capability of receiving
high level of wanted signal.

The requirement applies at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave of
a received signal and the interfering signal are from the same direction
and are within the *OTA REFSENS RoAoA.*

The wanted and interfering signals apply to all supported polarizations,
under the assumption of *polarization match*.

signal.

coordinate system orientation of the BS is set to be aligned with the
testing system.

5\) Repeat steps 2 - 4 for all conformance test bands and directions.

#### 10.4.3A.3 MU value derivation, FR1

The MU for OTA dynamic range requirement is not impacted by OTA chamber
related uncertainties, so the MU is the same as for the conducted
dynamic range requirement. This is further discussed and concluded in
clause 10.4.4.

### 10.4.4 Maximum accepted test system uncertainty

The OTA dynamic range requirement provides both a wanted signal and an
in-channel AWGN interferer to the BS input. Both the wanted signal and
interferer power levels are well above the receiver noise floor, to the
extent that the SNR in the receiver is dependent only on the transmitter
signal to AWGN level and is independent of the receiver noise level.

Small variations of the receiver power level due to uncertainty factors
in the OTA environment will impact both the wanted signal and AWGN
equally, and hence do not impact the SNR experienced by the receiver or
change the measurement result. Thus, the receiver dynamic range
requirement is not impacted by OTA chamber related uncertainties.

In TS 36.141 \[3\], the MU for the conducted RX dynamic range is taken
as the uncertainty in achieving the correct SNR at the test equipment
transmitter. Considering the above argumentation that OTA chamber
aspects will not impact MU for receiver dynamic range, the same MU of
0.3 dB as for the conducted case can be assumed.

### 10.4.5 Test Tolerance for OTA dynamic range

Considering the methodology described in clause 5.1, Test Tolerance
values for OTA dynamic range were derived based on values in
clause 10.4.4.

It has been agreed that the TT for the regulatory receiver directional
requirements should be zero, while the TT for other receiver directional
requirements should be equal to the MU.

An overview of the TT values for all the requirements is captured in
clause 18.

D in figure 7.2.1-4.

L~Unanted\_cal,\ A→E~: Calibration value for unwanted signal between A
and E in figure 7.2.1-4.

##### 10.5.2.2.2 Stage 2: BS measurement

manufacturer declared coordinate system reference point in the same
place as the phase centre of the reference antenna. The manufacturer
declared coordinate system orientation of the BS is set to be aligned
with testing system.

2\) Set the BS to be satisfied with the *RoAoA* desired by the
requirement covering conformance testing receiving direction.

3\) Rotate the BS to make the conformance testing receiving direction
aligned with the boresight of the reference antenna at the calibration
stage.

4\) For FDD BS start transmission at the required condition.

5\) Set the test signal mean power at the RF signal source generator for
wanted signal as the required level plus L~Wanted\_cal,\ A→D~ and the
reference measurement channel.

6\) Set the test signal mean power at the RF signal source generator for
unwanted signal as the required level plus L~Unwanted\_cal,\ A→E~ and
the interference signal channel.

7\) Measure the throughput.

8\) Repeat the above steps 1 - 6 per conformance testing direction.

#### 10.5.2.3 MU value derivation, FR1

The MU is estimated based on conducted MU value (e.g. as in

#### 10.5.3.3 MU value derivation, FR1

The MU is estimated based on conducted MU value (e.g. as in

uncertainty for matching of test equipment and BS or test antenna.

The 2 sigma matching uncertainty is 0.294 dB up to 4.2 GHz.

Where

$\text{MU}_{\text{wanted}} = \sqrt{\text{MU}_{\text{wanted}\_\text{conducted}}^{2} - \text{MU}_{\text{matching}\_\text{conducted}}^{2}}$

$\text{MU}_{\text{interfer}} = \sqrt{\text{MU}_{\text{interfer}\_\text{conducted}}^{2} - \text{MU}_{\text{matching}\_\text{conducted}}^{2}}$

$\text{MU}_{\text{chamber}\_\text{OTA}} = \sqrt{\text{MU}_{\text{EIS}\_\text{OTA}}^{2} - \text{MU}_{\text{TestEquipment}\_\text{OTA}}^{2} - \text{MU}_{\text{matching}\_\text{OTA}}^{2}}$

And we assume

#### 10.5.3A.1 Measurement system description

Measurement system description is captured in clause 7.6.1, with the PWS
measurement system setup for ACS, general blocking and narrowband
blocking depicted on figure 7.6.1-3.

#### 10.5.3A.2 Test procedure

##### 10.5.3.2A.1 Stage 1: Calibration

Calibration procedure for the PWS shall be done with the procedure shown
in clause 8.6, for the frequencies of wanted and interfering signals
with power combiner/coupler. Calculate the calibration value for wanted
and interfering signal from A to C as well as from A to D:

L~Wanted\_cal,\ A→C~: Calibration value for wanted signal between A and
C in figure 7.6.1-3.

L~interferer\_cal,\ A→D~: Calibration value for interfering signal
between A and D in figure 7.6.1-3.

##### 10.5.3A.2.2 Stage 2: BS measurement

The PWS testing procedure consists of the following steps:

1\) Install the BS with the manufacturer declared coordinate system
reference point in the same place as the phase center of the reference
antenna A as shown in figure 7.6.1-3. The manufacturer declared
coordinate system orientation of the BS is set to be aligned with the
testing system.

2\) Configure RF signal generator for wanted signal to set the signal at
the required level plus L~A→C~ and at reference measurement channel.

3\) Configure RF signal generator for interferer to set the signal at
the required level plus L~A→D~ and at reference measurement channel. The
interferer\'s centre frequency offset should be swept as required.

4\) Measure the throughput of the wanted signal.

5\) Repeat steps 2 - 4 for all conformance test directions.

6\) Repeat steps above per involved band for multi-band RIB(s).

#### 10.5.3A.3 MU value derivation, FR1

The MU is estimated based on conducted MU value (e.g. as in
TS 36.141 \[3\]), the MU for EIS in clause 10.2 and an estimated
uncertainty for matching of test equipment and BS or test antenna.

The 2 sigma matching uncertainty is 0.3 dB up to 4.2 GHz.

Test system uncertainty is obtained by following equations:

$\text{MU}_{\text{ACS}\_\text{OTA}} = \sqrt{\text{MU}_{\text{wanted}}^{2} + \text{MU}_{\text{interfer}}^{2} + \text{MU}_{\text{chamber}\_\text{OTA}}^{2} + \text{MU}_{\text{matching}\_\text{OTA}}^{2}} + \text{ACLR}_{\text{effect}}$

Where

$\text{MU}_{\text{wanted}} = \sqrt{\text{MU}_{\text{wanted}\_\text{conducted}}^{2} - \text{MU}_{\text{matching}\_\text{conducted}}^{2}}$

$\text{MU}_{\text{interfer}} = \sqrt{\text{MU}_{\text{interfer}\_\text{conducted}}^{2} - \text{MU}_{\text{matching}\_\text{conducted}}^{2}}$

$\text{MU}_{\text{chamber}\_\text{OTA}} = \sqrt{\text{MU}_{\text{EIS}\_\text{OTA}}^{2} - \text{MU}_{\text{TestEquipment}\_\text{OTA}}^{2} - \text{MU}_{\text{matching}\_\text{OTA}}^{2}}$

And we assume
$\text{MU}_{\text{matching}\_\text{conducted}} = \ \text{MU}_{\text{matching}\_\text{OTA}}$

Test system uncertainty for ACS, narrow band blocking, and general band
blocking is shown in table 10.5.3A.3-1. Note that all uncertainties in

Maximum test system uncertainties derivation methodology was described
in clause 5.1. The maximum accepted test system uncertainty values was
derived based on test system specific values.

According to the methodology referred above, the common maximum accepted
test system uncertainty values for OTA ACS, general blocking and
narrowband blocking test can be derived from values captured in table
10.5.4-1, derived based on the expanded uncertainty *u~e~* (1.96σ -
confidence interval of 95 %) values. The common maximum accepted test
system uncertainty values are applicable for all test methods addressing
OTA ACS, general blocking and narrowband blocking test requirements.

### 10.5.5 Test Tolerance for OTA ACS, general blocking and narrowband blocking

Considering the methodology described in clause 5.1, Test Tolerance
values for OTA ACS, general blocking and narrowband blocking were
derived based on values in clause 10.5.4.

It has been agreed that the TT for the regulatory receiver directional
requirements should be zero, while the TT for other receiver directional
requirements should be equal to the MU.

An overview of the TT values for all the requirements is captured in
clause 18.

10.6 OTA receiver intermodulation
---------------------------------

### 10.6.1 General

Clause 10.2 captures MU and TT values derivation for the OTA receiver
intermodulation directional requirement.

### 10.6.2 Indoor Anechoic Chamber

#### 10.6.2.1 Measurement system description

Measurement system description is captured in clause 7.2.1, with the
Indoor Anechoic Chamber measurement system setup for OTA RX IMD depicted
on figure 7.2.1-5.

#### 10.6.2.2 Test procedure

##### 10.6.2.2.1 Stage 1: Calibration

Calibration procedure for the Indoor Anechoic Chamber shall be done with
the procedure shown in clause 8.2, for frequencies of wanted and
unwanted signals with power combiner/coupler. Calculate the calibration
value for wanted and unwanted signal from A to D, from A to E, and from
A to F:

L~Wanted\_cal,\ A→D~: Calibration value for wanted signal between A and
D in figure 7.2.1-5.

L~Unanted\_cal,\ A→E~: Calibration value for unwanted signal between A
and E in figure 7.2.1-5.

L~Unanted\_cal,\ A→F~: Calibration value for unwanted signal between A
and F in figure 7.2.1-5.

##### 10.6.2.2.2 Stage 2: BS measurement

The IAC testing procedure consists of the following steps:

1\) Uninstall the reference antenna and install the BS with its
manufacturer declared coordinate system reference point in the same
place as the phase centre of the reference antenna. The manufacturer
declared coordinate system orientation of the BS is set to be aligned
with testing system.

2\) Set the BS to be satisfied with the *RoAoA* desired by the
requirement covering conformance testing receiving direction.

3\) Rotate the BS to make the conformance testing receiving direction
aligned with the boresight of the reference antenna at the calibration
stage.

4\) For FDD BS start transmission at the required condition.

5\) Set the test signal mean power at the RF signal source generator for
wanted signal as the required level plus L~Wanted\_cal,\ A→D~ and the
reference measurement channel.

6\) Set the test signal mean power at the RF signal source generators
for unwanted signal as the required level plus L~Unwanted\_cal,\ A→E~ or
plus L~Unwanted\_cal,\ A→F~ and the interference signal channel.

7\) Measure the throughput.

8\) Repeat the above steps 2 - 6 per conformance testing direction.

#### 10.6.2.3 MU value derivation, FR1

The MU is estimated based on conducted MU value (e.g. as in
TS 36.141 \[3\]), the MU for EIS in clause 10.2 and an estimated
uncertainty for matching of test equipment and BS or test antenna.

$\ \text{MU}_{RX\ IM\_ OTA} = \sqrt{\begin{matrix}
\text{MU}_{\text{wanted}}^{2} + {{(2 \times MU}_{\text{CWinterfer}})}^{2} + \text{MU}_{\text{MODinterfer}}^{2} + \text{MU}_{\text{chambe}r_{\text{OTA}}}^{2} \\
 + \text{MU}_{matching\_ OTA}^{2} \\
\end{matrix}} + \text{ACLR}_{\text{effect}}$

Where

$\text{MU}_{\text{wanted}}^{} = \sqrt{\text{MU}_{wanted\_ conducted}^{2} - \text{MU}_{matching\_ conducted}^{2}}$

$\text{MU}_{\text{interfer}}^{} = \sqrt{\text{MU}_{interfer\_ conducted}^{2} - \text{MU}_{matching\_ conducted}^{2}}$

$\text{MU}_{\text{CWinterfer}}^{} = \sqrt{\text{MU}_{CWinterfer\_ conducted}^{2} - \text{MU}_{matching\_ conducted}^{2}}$

$\text{MU}_{chamber\_ OTA}^{} = \sqrt{\text{MU}_{EIS\_ OTA}^{2} - \text{MU}_{TestEquipment\_ OTA}^{2} - \text{MU}_{matching\_ OTA}^{2}}$

The uncertainty budget behind the EIS MU is captured in clause 10.2. The
2 sigma matching uncertainty is 0.196 dB for f ≤ 3 GHz and 0.314 dB for
3 GHz \< f ≤ 4.2 GHz.

The ACLR effect from the interference signal is assumed to be 0.4 dB, as
in TS 36.141 \[3\]. This is under the assumption that no additional PA
is needed for the test signal in the OTA test setup.

The MU for RX IM is calculated as follows. Note that all uncertainties
in the table are 1.96σ values**.**

#### 10.6.3.1 Measurement system description

Measurement system description is captured in clause 7.3.1, with the
CATR measurement system setup for OTA RX IMD depicted on figure 7.3.1-4.

#### 10.6.3.2 Test procedure

##### 10.6.3.2.1 Stage 1: Calibration

Calibration procedure for the CATR shall be done with the procedure
shown in clause 8.3, for the frequencies of wanted and 2 interfering
signals with power combiners/couplers. Calculate the calibration value
for wanted and interfering signals from A to B as well as from A to E
and A to H:

L~Wanted\_cal,\ A→B~: Calibration value for wanted signal between A and
B in figure 7.3.1-4.

L~interferer1\_cal,\ A→E~: Calibration value for interfering signal
between A and E in figure 7.3.1-4.

L~interferer2\_cal,\ A→H~: Calibration value for interfering signal
between A and H in figure 7.3.1-4.

##### 10.6.3.2.2 Stage 2: BS measurement

The CATR testing procedure consists of the following steps:

1\) Set up BS in place of SGH from calibration stage. Align BS with
boresight of transmitting antenna.

2\) Configure RF signal generator for wanted signal to set the signal at
the required level plus L~A→B~ and at reference measurement channel.

3\) Configure RF signal generator for interferer1 to set a modulated
signal at the required level plus L~A→E~ and at reference measurement
channel. The interferer\'s centre frequency offset should also fulfil
the requirement.

4\) Configure RF signal generator for interferer2 to set a CW signal at
the required level plus L~A→H~ and at reference measurement channel. The
interferer\'s centre frequency offset should also fulfil the
requirement.

5\) Measure the BER or throughput of the wanted signal.

6\) Repeat steps all above per involved band for multi-band RIB(s).

#### 10.6.3.3 MU value derivation, FR1

The MU is estimated based on conducted MU value (e.g. as in
TS 36.141 \[3\]), the MU for EIS in clause 10.2 and an estimated
uncertainty for matching of test equipment and BS or test antenna.

Test system uncertainty is obtained by follwing equations:

$\ \text{MU}_{RX\ IM\_ OTA} = \sqrt{\begin{matrix}
\text{MU}_{\text{wanted}}^{2} + {{(2 \times MU}_{\text{CWinterfer}})}^{2} + \text{MU}_{\text{MODinterfer}}^{2} + \text{MU}_{\text{chambe}r_{\text{OTA}}}^{2} \\
 + \text{MU}_{matching\_ OTA}^{2} \\
\end{matrix}} + \text{ACLR}_{\text{effect}}$

Where

$\text{MU}_{\text{wanted}} = \sqrt{\text{MU}_{\text{wanted}\_\text{conducted}}^{2} - \text{MU}_{\text{matching}\_\text{conducted}}^{2}}$

$\text{MU}_{\text{MODinterfer}} = \sqrt{\text{MU}_{\text{MODinterfer}\_\text{conducted}}^{2} - \text{MU}_{\text{matching}\_\text{conducted}}^{2}}$

$\text{MU}_{\text{CWinterfer}} = \sqrt{\text{MU}_{\text{CWinterfer}\_\text{conducted}}^{2} - \text{MU}_{\text{matching}\_\text{conducted}}^{2}}$

$\text{MU}_{\text{chambe}r_{\_\text{OTA}}} = \sqrt{\text{MU}_{\text{EIS}\_\text{OTA}}^{2} - \text{MU}_{\text{TestEquipment}\_\text{OTA}}^{2} - \text{MU}_{\text{matching}\_\text{OTA}}^{2}}$

And we assume
$\text{MU}_{\text{matching}\_\text{conducted}} = \ \text{MU}_{\text{matching}\_\text{OTA}}$

The IAC testing procedure consists of the following steps:

1\) Uninstall the reference antenna and install the BS with the
manufacturer declared coordinate system reference point in the same
place as the phase centre of the reference antenna. The manufacturer
declared coordinate system orientation of the BS is set to be aligned
with the testing system.

2\) Rotate the BS to make the testing direction aligned with the
direction of the receiving antenna.

3\) Set the BS to transmit the test signal at the maximum power
according to the applicable test model.

4\) Measure the applicable test parameter.

5\) Repeat the above steps 3 - 4 at a number of discrete directions
around the sphere according to the chosen measurement grid, see
clause 6.3.3.

6\) Calculate TRPs from EIRP, as shown in clause 6.3.

The appropriate test parameter in step 4 is the measured mean power
P~R\_desired,\ D~ within the desired signal channel bandwidth for each
carrier arriving at the measurement equipment connector at reference
point D (figure 7.2.1-1). Calculation of EIRP~d~ is done using the
following equitation:

EIRP~d~ = P~R\_desired,\ D~ + L~TX\_cal,\ A→D~

NOTE: If the test facility only supports single polarization, then
measure EIRP with the test facility\'s test antenna/probe *polarization
matched* to the BS, then measure and sum the EIRP on both polarizations.
If the test facility supports dual polarization then measure total EIRP
for two orthogonal polarizations and calculate total radiated transmit
power as the sum over both polarizations.

### 11.2.3 Compact Antenna Test Range

#### 11.2.3.1 Measurement system description

Measurement system description is captured in clause 7.3.1, with the
Compact Antenna Test Range measurement system setup depicted on figure
8.3-1.

#### 11.2.3.2 Test procedure

##### 11.2.3.2.1 Stage 1: Calibration

Calibration procedure for the Compact Antenna Test Range is captured in
clause 8.3.

NOTE: This stage may be omitted provided calibration stage has been
performed already during output power measurement.

##### 11.2.3.2.2 Stage 2: BS measurement

The CATR testing procedure consists of the following steps:

1\) Set up BS in place of SGH from calibration stage. Align the
coordinates system of the BS with that of the test system.

2\) Set the BS to transmit the test signal at the maximum power
according to the applicable test model.

3\) Rotate the BS to make the testing direction aligned with the
direction of the receiving antenna.

4\) Measure the applicable test parameter.

5\) Repeat the above steps 2 - 4 at a number of discrete directions
around the sphere according to the chosen measurement grid, see
clause 6.3.3.

6\) Calculate TRPs from power density, as shown in clause 6.3.3.

The appropriate test parameter in step 5 is measured mean power
P~R\_desired,\ B~ within the desired signal channel bandwidth for each
carrier arriving at the measurement equipment connector B in figure
8.3-1. Calculation of power~d~ is done using the following equitation:

power~d~ = P~R\_desired,\ B~ + L~TX\_cal,\ A→B~

NOTE: If the test facility only supports single polarization, then
measure power with the test facility\'s test antenna/probe *polarization
matched* to the BS, then measure and sum the power on both
polarizations. If the test facility supports dual polarization then
measure total power for two orthogonal polarizations and calculate total
radiated transmit power as the sum over both polarizations.

uncertainty values for OTA BS output power measurements in CATR (Normal
test conditions, FR1).

#### 11.2.3.4 MU value derivation, FR2

A CATR MU budget was assessed in order to determine acceptable MU for
the EIRP accuracy measurement in FR2. The CATR test setup and
calibration and measurement procedures for FR2 are expected to be
similar to those of FR1, although the test chamber dimensions and
associated MU values will scale due to the shorter wavelengths and
larger relative array apertures.

Table 11.2.3.4-1 captures derivation of the expanded measurement
uncertainty values for OTA BS output power measurements in CATR (Normal
test conditions, FR2).

### 11.2.4 Near Field Test Range

#### 11.2.4.1 Measurement system description

Measurement system description is captured in clause 7.5.1.

In case of OTA BS output power measurements, NF to FF transform is not
needed since TRP is computed based on power density measured in Near
Field by sampling properly the declared beam.

#### 11.2.4.2 Test procedure

##### 11.2.4.2.1 Stage 1: Calibration

Calibration procedure for the Near Field Test Range is captured in
clause 8.5.

##### 11.2.4.2.2 Stage 2: BS measurement

The NFTR testing procedure consists of the following steps:

1\) Configure the beam of the BS according to the required conditions
for the TRP test.

2\) Set the BS to transmit the test signal at the maximum power
according to the applicable test model.

3\) Measure the power density at a number of points (Theta; Phi) in the
beam according to the chosen measurement grid. Refer to clause 6.3 for
details about measurement grids for TRP measurements.

4\) Calculate TRP from the measured power density as in clause 6.3.

#### 11.2.4.3 MU value derivation, FR1

Table 11.2.4.3-1 captures derivation of the expanded measurement
uncertainty values for OTA BS output power measurements in NFTR (Normal
test conditions, FR1).

### 11.2.5 Reverberation Chamber

#### 11.2.5.1 Measurement system description

Measurement system description is captured in clause 7.7.1.

#### 11.2.5.2 Test procedure

##### 11.2.5.2.1 Stage 1: Calibration

Calibration procedure for the Reverberation chamber is captured in
clause 8.7.

##### 11.2.5.2.2 Stage 2: BS measurement

TRP calculation in an RC does not rely on a coordinate system and as
such no reference coordinate system is defined for the RC method, and no
alignment between BS and test system is required. The BS should be
placed/mounted in the working volume of the RC. It is advised (but not
mandatory) to orient the BS is such a way that its antenna boresight is
pointing towards a well-stirred part of the chamber (such as towards the
stirrer).

The RC testing procedure consists of the following steps:

1\. Calculate Ambient Power Level:

1\) Connect the RX antenna to a calibrated receiver test equipment using
the same cables as in the calibration step. Turn on the BS control. Keep
the BS RF power off. Terminate the REF TX ant in a 50 Ω load. See figure
8.7-1 (b).

2\) Measure the voltage data *U~amb~* and calculate the ambient power
level as $\text{Uamb}$

3\) Calculate the ambient TRP level as

2\. Calculate BS TRP:

1\) Turn on the BS RF power and measure the received voltage *U~BS~*,
see figure 8.7-1 (c).

2\) Calculate the BS power as:
$\text{UEUT}$$P_{\text{BS}} = \frac{\left\langle \left| U_{\text{BS}} \right|^{2} \right\rangle}{50}$

3\) Calculate the TRP from the BS as:
$\text{TRP}_{\text{BS}} = \frac{\eta M_{1}^{(r)}}{P^{(r)}}P_{\text{BS}}$

4\) The following tests shall be performed on the measurement data:

\- The dynamic range $\text{TRP}$*TRP~BS~ / TRP~amb~* must be at least
20 dB.

\- The number of uncorrelated samples, calculated via the
auto-correlation function, see \[35\], shall be at least 250.

There is no need for additional directional measurements to the stirring
cycle. In a well-stirred chamber, all directional components will be
contained in the samples collected during the measurement cycle and
accounted for correctly in the final TRP calculation.

NOTE: A reverberation chamber does not represent a real-life deployment
for the BS and can be considered as a hostile environment due to the
potentially high field strengths. Therefore, it is important to make
sure that the BS is operating properly throughout the entire

### 11.2.6 Plane Wave Synthesizer

#### 11.2.6.1 Measurement system description

Measurement system description is captured in clause 7.6.1.

#### 11.2.6.2 Test procedure

##### 11.2.6.2.1 Stage 1: Calibration

Calibration procedure for the Plane Wave Synthesizer is captured in
clause 8.6.

##### 11.2.6.2.2 Stage 2: BS measurement

The PWS testing procedure consists of the following steps:

1\) Install the BS as BS with the manufacturer declared coordinate
system reference point in the same place as the phase center of the
reference antenna A as shown in figure 7.6.1-1. The manufacturer
declared coordinate system orientation of the BS is set to be aligned
with the testing system.

2\) Set the BS to generate the tested beam with the applicable test
model with the *beam peak direction* intended to be the same as the
testing direction.

3\) Measure the appropriate test parameter at the measurement equipment
(such as a spectrum analyzer or power meter) denoted in figure 7.6.1-1.

4\) Repeat the above steps 2 - 3 at a number of discrete directions
around the sphere according to the chosen measurement grid, see
clause 6.3.3.

5\) Calculate TRPs from power density, as shown in clause 6.3.3.

The appropriate test parameter in step 4 is mean power
P~R\_desired,\ C~, within the desired signal channel bandwidth for each
carrier arriving at the measurement equipment connector C in figure
7.6.1-1. Calculation of power~c~ is done using the following equitation:

power~c~ = P~R\_desired,\ C~ + L

NOTE: If the test facility only supports single polarization, then
measure power with the test facility\'s test antenna/probe *polarization
matched* to the BS, then measure and sum the power on both
polarizations. If the test facility supports dual polarization then
measure total power for two orthogonal polarizations and calculate total
radiated transmit power as the sum over both polarizations.

uncertainty values for OTA BS output power measurements in PWS.

### 11.2.7 Maximum accepted test system uncertainty

For the frequency range up to 4.2 GHz, the same MU values as for E-UTRA
in TS 37.145-2 \[4\] were adopted. It is expected that the test chamber
setup, calibration and measurement procedures for E-UTRA and NR will be
highly similar. All uncertainty factors were judged to be the same.

For the frequency range 4.2 - 6 GHz, all MU factors, including
instrumentation related MU were judged to be the same as for the 3 -
4.2 GHz range, and thus the total MU for 4.2 -- 6 GHz is the same as for
3 - 4.2 GHz. This assessment was made under the assumption of testing BS
designed for licensed spectrum; for unlicensed spectrum the MU may
differ.

For CATR the expanded MU is established as a root sum square combining
of the dB values for the MU and the SE (see clause 12.10), the MU was
decided to be 2.1 dB for the frequency range 24.25 \< f \< 29.5 GHz and
2.4 dB for the frequency range 37 \< f \< 43.5 GHz.

Maximum test system uncertainties derivation methodology was described
in clause 5.1. The maximum accepted test system uncertainty values was
derived based on test system specific values.

According to the methodology referred above, the common maximum accepted
test system uncertainty values for OTA BS output power test can be
derived from values captured in table 11.2.7-1 for FR1 and in table
11.2.7-2 for FR2, derived based on the expanded uncertainty *u~e~*
(1.96σ - confidence interval of 95 %) values. The common maximum
accepted test system uncertainty values are applicable for all test
methods addressing OTA BS output power test requirement.

An overview of the MU values for all the requirements is captured in
clause 17.

### 11.2.8 Test Tolerance for OTA BS output power

Considering the methodology described in clause 5.1, Test Tolerance
values for OTA BS output power were derived based on values captured in
clause 11.2.7.

The TT value was agreed to be the same as the MU value, both for FR1 and
FR2.

Frequency range specific Test Tolerance values for the OTA BS output
power test are defined in table 11.2.8-1 for FR1 and in table 11.2.8-2
for FR2.

11.3 OTA ACLR
-------------

### 11.3.1 General

Clause 11.3 captures MU and TT values derivation for the OTA ACLR *TRP
requirement* in Normal test conditions.

### 11.3.2 Indoor Anechoic Chamber

#### 11.3.2.1 Measurement system description

Measurement system description is captured in clause 7.2.1, with the
Indoor Anechoic Chamber measurement system setup depicted on figure
7.2.1-1.

NOTE: Whilst the TRP estimation does not require far-field conditions
explicitly the MU budget below is based on errors under far-field
conditions. If far-field conditions are not met an in-door anechoic
chamber may be used but a separate MU analysis is necessary.

#### 11.3.2.2 Test procedure

##### 11.3.2.2.1 Stage 1: Calibration

Calibration procedure for the Indoor Anechoic Chamber is captured in
clause 8.2 with the calibration system setup for TX requirements
depicted in figure 8.2-1.

Calibration shall be performed individually for both the wanted signal
and adjacent channel frequencies.

##### 11.3.2.2.2 Stage 2: BS measurement

Reference IAC procedure in clause 11.2.2.2.2 (i.e. the same procedure as
for OTA BS output power measurement in IAC). The appropriate parameters
in step 4 are:

P~R\_desired,\ D~: Measured mean power within the desired signal channel
bandwidth for each carrier at the measurement equipment connector at D
in figure 7.2.1-1.

P~R\_emission,\ D~: Measured mean emission power in the neighbouring
channel bandwidth for each carrier at the measurement equipment
connector at D in figure 7.2.1-1.

Calculation of power~d~ and power~e~ is done using following formulas:

power~d~ = P~R\_desired,\ D~ + L~TX\_cal,\ A→D~

power~e~ = P~R\_emission,\ D~ + L~TX\_cal,\ A→D~

After calculation of TRP from power as shown in clause 6.3 calculate the
OTA ACLR.

### 11.3.3 Compact Antenna Test Range

#### 11.3.3.1 Measurement system description

Measurement system description is captured in clause 7.3.1, with the
Compact Antenna Test Range measurement system setup depicted on figure
8.3-1.

#### 11.3.3.2 Test procedure

##### 11.3.3.2.1 Stage 1: Calibration

Calibration procedure for the Compact Antenna Test Range is captured in
clause 8.3.

NOTE: This stage may be omitted provided calibration stage has been
performed already during output power measurement.

##### 11.3.3.2.2 Stage 2: BS measurement

The CATR testing procedure consists of the following steps:

1\) Align BS with boresight of the range antenna.

2\) Configure carrier at a power level according to the manufacturer\'s
declared rated output power and test configuration.

3\) Measure wanted and adjacent channel power for the frequency offsets
both side of carrier frequency considering both polarizations of the
range antenna. In multiple carrier case only offset frequencies below
the lowest and above the offsets highest carrier frequency used shall be
measured for ACLR; offsets in between carriers may be subject to CACLR.

4\) Repeat step 3 for additional points for all necessary points needed
for full TRP for the wanted signal and adjacent channel emissions.

5\) Calculate ACLR or CACLR from the wanted signal TRP and the adjacent
channel emissions TRP.

The appropriate parameters in step 3 are:

P~R\_desired,\ D~: Measured mean power within the desired signal channel
bandwidth for each carrier at the measurement equipment connector at D
in figure 7.3.1-1.

P~R\_emission,\ D~: Measured mean emission power in the neighbouring
channel bandwidth for each carrier at the measurement equipment
connector at D in figure 7.3.1-1.

Calculation of Power~d~ and Power~e~ is done using following formulas:

Power~d~ = P~R\_desired,\ D~ + L~TX\_cal,\ A→D~

Power~e~ = P~R\_emission,\ D~ + L~TX\_cal,\ A→D~

After calculation of TRP from power as shown in clause 6.3, calculate
the OTA ACLR.

#### 11.3.3.4 MU value derivation, FR2

A CATR MU budget was assessed in order to determine acceptable MU for
the EIRP accuracy measurement in FR2. The CATR test setup and
calibration and measurement procedures for FR2 are expected to be
similar to those of FR1, although the test chamber dimensions and
associated MU values will scale due to the shorter wavelengths and
larger relative array apertures. However, it is noted that in order to
achieve the test instrument uncertainties that were assumed, calibration
of the spectrum analyzer may be needed.

Table 11.3.3.4-1 captures derivation of the expanded measurement
uncertainty values for absolute OTA ACLR measurements in in Compact
Antenna Test Range (Normal test conditions, FR2).

Table 11.3.3.4-2 captures derivation of the expanded measurement
uncertainty values for relative OTA ACLR measurements in in Compact
Antenna Test Range (Normal test conditions, FR2).

### 11.3.4 Near Field Test Range

#### 11.3.4.1 Measurement system description

Measurement system description is captured in clause 7.5.1.

In case of OTA ACLR measurement, the NF to FF transform is not needed
since ACLR is based on TRP.

#### 11.3.4.2 Test procedure

##### 11.3.4.2.1 Stage 1: Calibration

Calibration procedure for the Near Field Test Range is captured in
clause 8.5.

##### 11.3.4.2.2 Stage 2: BS measurement

The NFTR procedure for absolute ACLR OTA measurement consists of the
following steps:

1\. Configure TX branch and carrier according to the required test
configuration

2\. Measure in Near Field ACLR and CALCR for the frequency offsets both
side of carrier frequency for both polarizations. In multiple carrier
case only offset frequencies below the lowest and above the offsets
highest carrier frequency used shall be measured.

a\. Power is measured Near Field -- no NF to FF transform is applied.

b\. Full sphere power is measured with using a defined sampling grid
(refer to clause 6.3 for proper measurement grids).

3\. Calculate TRP.

Table 11.3.4.3-1 captures derivation of the expanded measurement
uncertainty values for OTA ACLR measurements in NFTR (Normal test
conditions, FR1).

### 11.3.6 Plane Wave Synthesizer

#### 11.3.6.1 Measurement system description

Measurement system description is captured in clause 7.6.1.

#### 11.3.6.2 Test procedure

##### 11.3.6.2.1 Stage 1: Calibration

Calibration procedure for the Plane Wave Synthesizer is captured in
clause 8.6.

NOTE: This stage may be omitted provided calibration stage has been
performed already during output power measurement.

##### 11.3.6.2.2 Stage 2: BS measurement

The PWS testing procedure consists of the following steps:

1\) Align BS with boresight of the range antenna.

2\) Configure carrier at a power level according to the manufacturer\'s
declared rated output power and test configuration.

3\) Measure wanted and adjacent channel power for the frequency offsets
both side of carrier frequency considering both polarizations of the
range antenna. In multiple carrier case only offset frequencies below
the lowest and above the offsets highest carrier frequency used shall be
measured for ACLR; offsets in between carriers may be subject to CACLR.

4\) Repeat step 3 for additional points for all necessary points needed
for full TRP for the wanted signal and adjacent channel emissions.

5\) Calculate ACLR or CACLR from the wanted signal TRP and the adjacent
channel emissions TRP.

The appropriate parameters in step 3 are:

P~R\_desired,\ C~: Measured mean power within the desired signal channel
bandwidth for each carrier at the measurement equipment connector at C
in figure 7.6.1-1.

P~R\_emission,\ C~: Measured mean emission power in the neighbouring
channel bandwidth for each carrier at the measurement equipment
connector at C in figure 7.6.1-1.

Calculation of Power~d~ and Power~e~ is done using following formulas:

Power~c~ = P~R\_desired,\ C~ + L

Power~e~ = P~R\_emission,\ C~ + L

After calculation of TRP from power as shown in clause 6.3, calculate
the OTA ACLR.

#### 11.3.6.3 MU value derivation, FR1

The MU value derivation for absolute ACLR measurements is the same as in
clause 11.2.6.3 (i.e. OTA BS output power).

Table 11.3.6.3-1 captures derivation of the expanded measurement
uncertainty values for relative ACLR measurements in PWS.

Table 11.3.6.3-2 captures derivation of the expanded measurement
uncertainty values for absolute ACLR measurements in PWS.

### 11.3.7 Maximum accepted test system uncertainty

For the frequency range up to 4.2 GHz, the same MU values as for E-UTRA
were adopted. It is expected that the test chamber setup, calibration
and measurement procedures for E-UTRA and NR will be highly similar. All
uncertainty factors were judged to be the same.

For the frequency range 4.2 - 6 GHz, all MU factors, including
instrumentation related MU were judged to be the same as for the 3 -
4.2 GHz range, and thus the total MU for 4.2 -- 6 GHz is the same as for
3 - 4.2 GHz. This assessment was made under the assumption of testing BS
designed for licensed spectrum; for unlicensed spectrum the MU may
differ.

For CATR the expanded MU is established as a root sum square combining
of the dB values for the MU and the SE (see clause 6.3.6), the MU for
absolute ACLR was decided to be 2.7 dB for the frequency range 24.25 \<
f \< 29.5 GHz and 2.7 dB for the frequency range 37 \< f \< 43.5 GHz.
The MU for relative ACLR was decided to be 2.3 dB for the frequency
range 24.25 \< f \< 29.5 GHz and 2.6 dB for the frequency range 37 \< f
\< 43.5 GHz.

Maximum test system uncertainties derivation methodology was described
in clause 5.1. The maximum accepted test system uncertainty values was
derived based on test system specific values.

According to the methodology referred above, the common maximum accepted
test system uncertainty values for absolute and relative OTA ACLR tests
can be derived from values captured in tables 11.3.7-1 to 11.3.7-4,
derived based on the expanded uncertainty *u~e~* (1.96σ - confidence
interval of 95 %) values. The common maximum accepted test system
uncertainty values are applicable for all test methods addressing OTA
ACLR test requirement.

  NOTE: MU estimation for 43.5 \< f \< 48.2 GHz was derived based on the linear approximation (based on MU values for lower frequency ranges). MU extrapolation approach was used instead of the typical derivation of the Expanded MU based on the MU budget calculations, as in case of lower frequency ranges.                                                            

For relative ACLR, the MU value was agreed to be 1.0 dB for 0 -- 3 GHz
bands and 1.2 dB for 3 -- 6 GHz bands. The MU in 4.2 - 6 GHz is valid
for BS designed to operate in licensed spectrum.

For absolute ACLR, the MU value was agreed to be 2.2 dB for 0 -- 3 GHz
bands and 2.7 dB for 3 -- 6 GHz bands. The MU in 4.2 - 6 GHz is valid
for BS designed to operate in licensed spectrum.

An overview of the MU values for all the requirements is captured in
clause 17.

### 11.3.8 Test Tolerance for OTA ACLR

Considering the methodology described in clause 5.1, Test Tolerance
values for OTA ACLR were derived based on values captured in
clause 11.3.7.

For FR1:

\- For relative ACLR, the TT was agreed to be the same as the MU.

\- For absolute ACLR, the TT was agreed to be 0 dB.

For FR2: The TT was agreed to be the same as the MU.

Frequency range specific Test Tolerance values for the OTA ACLR test are
defined in tables 11.3.8-1 to 11.3.8-4.

clause 18.

11.4 OTA SEM and OTA OBUE
-------------------------

### 11.4.1 General

Clause 11.4 captures MU and TT values derivation for the OTA operating
band unwanted emission (OBUE) *TRP requirement*, as well as the OTA
spectrum emission mask (SEM) in Normal test conditions.

### 11.4.2 Indoor Anechoic Chamber

#### 11.4.2.1 Measurement system description

Measurement system description is captured in clause 7.2.1, with the
Indoor Anechoic Chamber measurement system setup depicted on figure
7.2.1-1.

NOTE: Whilst the TRP estimation does not require far-field conditions
explicitly the MU budget below is based on errors under far-field
conditions. If far-field conditions are not met an in-door anechoic
chamber may be used but a separate MU analysis is necessary.

#### 11.4.2.2 Test procedure

##### 11.4.2.2.1 Stage 1: Calibration

Calibration procedure for the Indoor Anechoic Chamber is captured in
clause 8.2 with the calibration system setup for TX requirements
depicted in figure 8.2-1.

Calibration shall be performed individually for each frequency at which
unwanted emissions are measured. This may involve calibration
measurement or interpolation between calibration points.

##### 11.4.2.2.2 Stage 2: BS measurement

Reference IAC procedure in clause 11.2.2.2.2 (i.e. the same procedure as
for OTA BS output power measurement in IAC).

The appropriate parameters in step 4 is the mean power for OBUE or SEM
test for each carrier arriving at the measurement equipment connector D
(figure 7.2.1-1), denoted by P~R\_OBUE,\ D~ or P~R\_SEM,\ D~, and
calculation of EIRP~e~ using following formulas:

EIRP~e~ = P~R\_OBUE\_D~ + L~TX\_cal,\ A→D~

EIRP~e~ = P~R\_SEM\_D~ + L~TX\_cal,\ A→D~

#### 11.4.2.3 MU value derivation, FR1

Table 11.4.2.3-1 captures derivation of the expanded measurement
uncertainty values for OTA OBUE or OTA SEM measurements in Indoor
Anechoic Chamber (Normal test conditions, FR1).

### 11.4.3 Compact Antenna Test Range

#### 11.4.3.1 Measurement system description

Measurement system description is captured in clause 7.3.1, with the
Compact Antenna Test Range measurement system setup depicted on figure
8.3-1.

#### 11.4.3.2 Test procedure

##### 11.4.3.2.1 Stage 1: Calibration

Calibration should be carried out using the same procedure as in 8.3.

Calibration shall be performed individually for each frequency at which
unwanted emissions are measured. This may involve calibration
measurement or interpolation between calibration points.

NOTE: This stage may be omitted provided calibration stage has been
performed already during BS output power measurement.

##### 11.4.3.2.2 Stage 2: BS measurement

Reference CATR procedure in clause 11.2.3.2.2 (i.e. the same procedure
as for OTA BS output power).

The appropriate parameters in step 4 is the mean power for OBUE or SEM
test for each carrier arriving at the measurement equipment connector B
(figure 7.3.1-1), denoted by P~R\_OBUE\_B~ or P~R\_SEM\_B~, and
calculation of power~e~ is done using following formulas:

power~e~ = P~R\_OBUE\_B~ + L~TX\_cal,\ A→B~

power~e~ = P~R\_SEM\_B~ + L~TX\_cal,\ A→B~

Table 11.4.3.3-1 captures derivation of the expanded measurement
uncertainty values for OTA OBUE or OTA SEM measurements in CATR (Normal
test conditions, FR1).

#### 11.4.3.4 MU value derivation, FR2

A CATR MU budget was assessed in order to determine acceptable MU for
the EIRP accuracy measurement in FR2. The CATR test setup and
calibration and measurement procedures for FR2 are expected to be
similar to those of FR1, although the test chamber dimensions and
associated MU values will scale due to the shorter wavelengths and
larger relative array apertures. However, it is noted that in order to
achieve the test instrument uncertainties that were assumed, calibration
of the spectrum analyzer may be needed.

Table 11.4.3.4-1 captures derivation of the expanded measurement
uncertainty values for OTA OBUE measurements in CATR (Normal test
conditions, FR2).

#### 11.4.4.1 Measurement system description

Measurement system description is captured in clause 7.5.1.

In case of OTA OBUE measurement, NF to FF transform is not needed since
TRP is computed based on power density measured in Near Field by
sampling properly the power density for OBUE or SEM.

#### 11.4.4.2 Test procedure

##### 11.4.4.2.1 Stage 1: Calibration

Calibration procedure for the Near Field Test Range is captured in
clause 8.5.

##### 11.4.4.2.2 Stage 2: BS measurement

Refer to clause 11.2.4.2.2 (i.e. same procedure as for OTA BS output
power in the NFTR). The measured power in step 3 is the power density
for OBUE or SEM test for each carrier arriving at the measurement
equipment connector.

### 11.4.6 Plane Wave Synthesizer

#### 11.4.6.1 Measurement system description

Measurement system description is captured in clause 7.6.1.

#### 11.4.6.2 Test procedure

##### 11.4.6.2.1 Stage 1: Calibration

Calibration procedure for the Plane Wave Synthesizer is captured in
clause 8.6.

NOTE: This stage may be omitted provided calibration stage has been
performed already during OTA BS output power measurement.

Calibration shall be performed individually for each frequency at which
unwanted emissions are measured. This may involve calibration
measurement or interpolation between calibration points.

##### 11.4.6.2.2 Stage 2: BS measurement

Reference PWS procedure in clause 11.2.6.2.2 (i.e. the same procedure as
for OTA BS output power in PWS).

The appropriate parameters in step 3 is the mean power for OBUE or SEM
test for each carrier arriving at the measurement equipment connector C
(figure 7.6.1-1), denoted by P~R\_OBUE,\ C~ or P~R\_SEM,\ C~, and
calculation of EIRP~e~ is done using following formulas:

EIRP~e~ = P~R\_OBUE\_C~ + L

EIRP~e~ = P~R\_SEM\_C~ + L

#### 11.4.6.3 MU value derivation, FR1

The MU value for OTA OBUE or OTA SEM in PWS is the same as in
clause 11.2.6.3 (i.e. OTA BS output power MU in PWS).

### 11.4.7 Maximum accepted test system uncertainty

For the frequency range up to 4.2 GHz, the same MU values as for E-UTRA
were adopted. It is expected that the test chamber setup, calibration
and measurement procedures for E-UTRA and NR will be highly similar. All
uncertainty factors were judged to be the same.

For the frequency range 4.2 - 6 GHz, all MU factors, including
instrumentation related MU were judged to be the same as for the 3 -
4.2 GHz range, and thus the total MU for 4.2 -- 6 GHz is the same as for
3 - 4.2 GHz. This assessment was made under the assumption of testing BS
designed for licensed spectrum; for unlicensed spectrum the MU may
differ.

Maximum test system uncertainties derivation methodology was described
in clause 5.1. The maximum accepted test system uncertainty values was
derived based on test system specific values.

According to the methodology referred above, the common maximum accepted
test system uncertainty values for OTA OBUE or OTA SEM test can be
derived from values captured in tables 11.4.7-1 and 11.4.7-2, derived
based on the expanded uncertainty *u~e~* (1.96σ - confidence interval of
95 %) values. The common maximum accepted test system uncertainty values
are applicable for all test methods addressing OTA OBUE or OTA SEM test
requirement.

SEM measurement, FR1

The MU value was agreed to be 1.4 dB for up to 3 GHz bands and 1.5 dB
for 3 -- 6 GHz bands. The MU in 4.2-6 GHz is valid for BS designed to
operate in licensed spectrum.

For CATR the expanded MU is established as a root sum square combining
of the dB values for the MU and the SE (see clause 6.3.6), the MU was
decided to be 2.7 dB for the frequency range 24.25 \< f \< 29.5 GHz and
2.7 dB for the frequency range 37 \< f \< 43.5 GHz.

An overview of the MU values for all the requirements is captured in
clause 17.

### 11.4.8 Test Tolerance for OTA OBUE and OTA SEM

Considering the methodology described in clause 5.1, Test Tolerance
values for OTA OBUE and OTA SEM were derived based on values captured in
clause 11.4.7.

NOTE: For OTA SEM, TT values up to 4.2 GHz apply.

FR1: The TT value was agreed to be the same as the MU value for 0 -
10 MHz from the carrier and 0 dB for \>10 MHz from the carrier.

FR2: The TT value was agreed to be the same as the MU (i.e. 2.7 dB) for
0 - 10% of the BS channel bandwidth away from the carrier, and 0 dB for
\>10% of BS channel bandwidth from the carrier.

Frequency range specific Test Tolerance values for the OTA OBUE and OTA
SEM test in FR1 are defined in table 11.4.8-1.

Frequency range specific Test Tolerance values for the OTA OBUE test in
FR2 are defined in table 11.4.8-2.

12 Out-of-band TRP requirements
===============================

12.1 General
------------

The TRP MU consists of a MU per-point and a *TRP summation error* (SE)
which allows for errors in the calculation of the TRP from multiple
directional power measurements and allows for a sparse grid to be used
to reduce measurement time. The total MU is calculated as follows:

Refer to clause 6.3.6 for the SE value derivation.

12.2 Transmitter mandatory spurious emissions
---------------------------------------------

### 12.2.1 General

Clause 12.2 captures MU and TT values derivation for the TX mandatory
spurious emissions *TRP requirement* in Normal test conditions.

The conducted spurious emission requirement MU is split up into a number
of frequency ranges as in table 12.2.1-1.

Table 12.2.1 -1: MU values for conducted spurious emission requirement

  Transmitter spurious emissions, mandatory requirements   MU (dB)
  -------------------------------------------------------- ---------
  30 MHz ≤ f ≤ 4 GHz                                       2.0
  4 GHz \< f ≤ 19 GHz                                      4.0

The conducted analysis based on UTRA/E-UTRA frequencies which were all
below 4.2 GHz (at the time), the break point in the MU is hence somewhat
related to the in-band and out-of-band MU analysis. As in-band MU
analysis is now being done up to 6 GHz (for the LAA and NR bands) it is
sensible to change the frequency break point to 6 GHz.

The spurious emission requirements cover a large frequency range from
30 MHz to 26 GHz, many of the chambers chosen for analysis cannot cover
this entire range. The MU analysis is therefore based on a General
Chamber analysis (see 7.7.3) rather than any specific OTA chamber. Other
chambers may of course be used as long as the MU is within the specified
value (or the test requirement is offset appropriately) and they are
suitable for the frequencies being tested.

The spurious emissions requirements of the *BS type 2-O* are between
30 MHz to the 2^nd^ harmonic of the DL operating band. Currently the
upper frequency limit calculated MU is 60 GHz.

This range can be split into a number of regions:

**30 MHz \< f ≤ 6 GHz**

This region also exists in FR1, the same MU is assumed for FR2 and for
FR1.

**6 GHz \< f ≤ 18 GHz**

This is also an FR1 region however the MU values assumed in FR1 is
larger than the in-band MU for FR2 which is at a higher frequency. An
FR2 BS will likely be smaller than an FR1 BS and hence the chamber can
be smaller and the requirements on the quiet zone can be relaxed. In
addition, the test equipment is suitable for much higher frequencies
(FR2 in band is above the frequency range) implying a low uncertainty.
The MU in the region therefore is assumed to be the same as the FR2
in-band MU.

**18 GHz \< f ≤ 43.5 GHz**

This frequency range covers the FR2 in-band region. The in-band MU
budget is found in clause 11.2.5.4.

**43.5 GHz \< f ≤ 60 GHz**

This frequency range is above the in-band region, the measured
frequencies are above the measurement frequency of the test equipment
and hence a mixer is used to down convert the measured frequency to
within the range of the test equipment.

It is not necessary to measure TRP in the far field as a large enough
range may be impractical for the frequency range being considered.

### 12.2.2 General Chamber

#### 12.2.2.1 Measurement system description

As the BS antenna radiating dimensions are fixed then the far field
distance increases (FF ≈ 2d^2^/λ). At 12.75 GHz the far field distance
for a 1.5 m BS *antenna array* is almost 200 m, this is clearly
impractical in an indoor chamber (and the path loss would also make
measurement difficult), so spurious emission testing will not always be
in the far field. This is acceptable as the requirement is TRP and hence
it is not necessary to measure in the far field however it needs to be
considered when looking at MU.

Considerations of the large frequency range must also be considered,
including the chamber performance (quiet zone), the calibration
effectiveness and the available reference and test antennas over the
frequency range.

Measurement system description is captured in clause 7.7.3.

#### 12.2.2.2 Test procedure

##### 12.2.2.2.1 Stage 1: Calibration

Calibration procedure for the General Chamber is captured in
clause 8.7A.

NOTE: The calibration for the out-of-band measurements should be
repeated for each frequency being tested and each test antenna.

##### 12.2.2.2.2 Stage 2: BS measurement

The General Chamber testing procedure consists of the following steps:

1\) Place the BS at the positioner.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of the
BS with the test system.

3\) Measurements shall use appropriate measurement bandwidth.

4\) The measurement device characteristics shall be: Detection mode:
True RMS.

5\) Set the BS to transmit according to the applicable test
configuration

6\) Align the BS and the test antenna such that measurements to
determine TRP can be performed (see clause 6.3.3 for the TRP measurement
procedures).

7\) Measure the emission at the specified frequencies with specified
measurement bandwidth.

8\) Repeat step 6 - 7 for all directions in the appropriated TRP
measurement grid needed for full TRP estimation (see clause 6.3.3 for
the TRP measurement procedures) and for frequency points to be tested.

NOTE 1: The TRP measurement grid may not be the same for all measurement
frequencies.

NOTE 2: The frequency sweep or the TRP measurement grid sweep may be
done in any order.

9\) Calculate TRP at each specified frequency using the directional
measurements.

#### 12.2.2.3 MU value derivation, FR1

For FR1 a General Chamber and Reverberation Chamber were analysed for
the MU derivation. Table 12.2.2.3-1 captures derivation of the expanded
measurement uncertainty values for OTA TX spurious emissions
measurements in General Chamber (Normal test conditions, FR1).

#### 12.2.2.4 MU value derivation, FR2

As opposed to FR1, for FR2 the IAC, CATR and Reverberation Chamber were
analysed separately for the MU value derivation. Table 12.2.2.4-1
captures derivation of the expanded measurement uncertainty values for
OTA TX spurious emissions measurements in IAC (Normal test conditions,
FR2).

Up to 43.5 GHz the OBUE MU values are assumed.

### 12.2.5 Maximum accepted test system uncertainty

Considering the methodology described in clause 5.1, maximum accepted
test system uncertainty values for OTA transmitter spurious emissions
were derived based on values captured in clauses 12.2.1 to 12.2.4.

Frequency range specific Test Tolerance values for the OTA TX spurious
emissions test are defined in tables 12.2.5-1 and 12.2.5-2.

Hence, we have the following MU values for the whole spurious emissions
range (for FR1 and FR2 cases):

For FR2 only the frequency range 43.5 GHz \< f ≤ 60 GHz has been
considered in this clause, the other frequency ranges are common with
existing FR1 and FR2 in-band TRP emissions measurements:

\- 30 MHz \< f ≤ 6 GHz: the MU values are the same as for FR1,

\- 6 GHz \< f ≤ 43.5 GHz: the MU values are the same as the in-band TRP
emission measurements in clause 11.2.

### 12.2.6 Test Tolerance for OTA TX spurious emissions

The conduced test tolerance for the mandatory spurious emissions
requirements is zero. As the requirements are set by regulatory limits
the same test tolerance is used for OTA.

TT = 0.

12.3 Receiver spurious emissions
--------------------------------

### 12.3.1 General

Clause 12.3 captures MU and TT values derivation for the RX spurious
emissions *TRP requirement* in Normal test conditions.

The conducted receiver spurious emission requirement MU is the same as
for the TX spurious emissions, the measurement technique is the same and
the power level is \> -60 dBm (where there is a break point for
conducted power measurement accuracy), so this is reasonable.

For the OTA receiver emissions requirements however the lower power
level of the requirement reduces the dynamic range of the TRP
measurement and reduces measurement accuracy.

Considering that the loss in the chamber is based on the wanted signal
being in the far field the per point noise floor is assumed to be
approx. -100 dBm and the receiver emissions level translated to the test
equipment is approx. -90 dBm. Hence the TRP calculation has only a 10 dB
dynamic range.

An uncertainty of 1 dB is added to the TRP uncertainty budget to account
for this additional uncertainty.

### 12.3.2 General Chamber

#### 12.3.2.1 Measurement system description

As the BS antenna radiating dimensions are fixed then the far field
distance increases (FF ≈ 2d^2^/λ). At 12.75 GHz the far field distance
for a 1.5 m BS *antenna array* is almost 200 m, this is clearly
impractical in an indoor chamber (and the path loss would also make
measurement difficult), so spurious emission testing will not always be
in the far field. This is acceptable as the requirement is TRP and hence
it is not necessary to measure in the far field however it needs to be
considered when looking at MU.

Considerations of the large frequency range must also be considered,
including the chamber performance (quiet zone), the calibration
effectiveness and the available reference and test antennas over the
frequency range.

Measurement system description is captured in clause 7.7.3.

#### 12.3.2.2 Test procedure

##### 12.3.2.2.1 Stage 1: Calibration

Calibration procedure for the General Chamber is captured in
clause 8.7A.

NOTE: The calibration for the out-of-band measurements should be
repeated for each frequency being tested and each test antenna.

##### 12.3.2.2.2 Stage 2: BS measurement

The General Chamber measurement procedure is the same as described in
clause 12.2.2.2.2 (i.e. OTA TX spurious emissions in General Chamber).

#### 12.3.2.3 MU value derivation, FR1

Table 12.3.2.3-1 captures derivation of the expanded measurement
uncertainty values for OTA RX spurious emissions measurements in General
Chamber (Normal test conditions, FR1).

### 12.3.3 Maximum accepted test system uncertainty

The TRP MU is very similar to that for the transmitter mandatory
spurious emissions. However, the receiver requirements are at a much
lower power level so TRP calculation may be affected by the noise floor
of the measurement system.

For FR2 the following MU are calculated.

For FR2 the out of band frequency range is much larger, the range can be
split into a number of regions:

**30 MHz \< f ≤ 6 GHz**

The same value is assumed for receiver spurious emissions as for
transmitter spurious emissions. This is the same as the in band FR2 MU
value.

**6 GHz \< f ≤ 18 GHz**

The same value is assumed for receiver spurious emissions as for
transmitter spurious emissions. This is the same as the in band FR2 MU
value.

**18 GHz \< f ≤ 43.5 GHz**

The same value is assumed for receiver spurious emissions as for
transmitter spurious emissions. This is calculated in clause 12.2.5.

**43.5 GHz \< f ≤ 60 GHz**

The same value is assumed for receiver spurious emissions as for
transmitter spurious emissions. This is calculated in clause 12.2.5.

### 12.3.4 Test Tolerance for OTA RX spurious emissions

The conduced test tolerance for the receiver spurious emissions
requirements is zero. However for OTA BS the receiver spurious emissions
requirements only apply to TTD in OFF mode. As such the limit is set by
RAN4 to be considerably lower than the equivalent regulatory
requirement.

In addition due to the difficulty in measuring low levels of TRP close
to the measurement system noise floor the risk of false failures is
high. As the risk is due to the noise floor of the measurement system it
cannot be mitigated by BS design.

Hence it has been agreed that for receiver spurious emissions the TT =
MU.

From December 2019, the regulation around receiver spurious emissions
has been clarified in ERC recommendation 74-01 \[25\] and the
requirement has been updated. Since then OTA RX spurious emissions is a
regulatory requirement with TT = 0.

12.4 Additional (co-existence) spurious emissions
-------------------------------------------------

### 12.4.1 General

Clause 12.4 captures MU and TT values derivation for the additional
(co-existence) spurious emission *TRP requirement* in Normal test
conditions.

The additional spurious emissions requirements consist of the
co-existence emissions requirements, and some additional regional
requirements such as the protection of PHS and 700 and 800 public
safety.

The conducted MU are consistent with the mandatory spurious emissions
MU.

The test set up for the OTA additional emissions requirements is the
same as that for the mandatory spurious emissions in clause 12.2.1.
However, the additional spurious emissions are at a much lower level
than the mandatory requirements so the additional effect of the test
system dynamic range must be considered in the same way as the receiver
emissions requirements.

Unlike the other spurious emissions requirements the additional
(co-existence) requirements are specified for other 3GPP bands and as
such can be measured in the same chambers as the in-band measurements.

As the CATR MU budget results is the largest MU and is used for setting
the in-band MU values only the CATR MU is analysed below. However any
suitable IAC or NFTR chamber can be used.

### 12.4.2 Compact Antenna Test Range

#### 12.4.2.1 Measurement system description

The CATR method only is described as it provides the worst MU budget for
the additional requirements MU analysis.

Measurement system description is captured in clause 7.3.1, with the
Compact Antenna Test Range measurement system setup depicted on figure
8.3-1.

#### 12.4.2.2 Test procedure

##### 12.4.2.2.1 Stage 1: Calibration

Calibration procedure for the Compact Antenna Test Range is captured in
clause 8.3.

NOTE: The calibration for the out-of-band measurements should be
repeated for each frequency being tested and each test antenna.

##### 12.4.2.2.2 Stage 2: BS measurement

Reference CATR procedure in clause 11.2.3.2.2 (i.e. OTA BS output power
in CATR).

The appropriate parameters in step 4 is the mean power of additional
spurious emissions test over the measurement BW described in the test
requirement.

#### 12.4.2.3 MU value derivation, FR1

Table 12.4.2.3-1 captures derivation of the expanded measurement
uncertainty values for additional (co-existence) OTA TX spurious
emissions measurements in CATR (Normal test conditions, FR1).

### 12.4.3 Maximum accepted test system uncertainty

The additional spurious emission requirements including the co-existence
with other BS in the same geographical area are based on existing
co-existence with other 3GPP bands so the frequency ranges for the
uncertainty assessment are different from the mandatory spurious
emissions. In this case the uncertainty budgets for the in-band chambers
are considered in the MU analysis. As the TRP level is at a low power
level the measurement system dynamic range uncertainty is also
considered as with the receiver spurious emissions.

(co-existence) spurious emissions measurement

NOTE: There are currently no additional spurious emissions requirements
or co-existence requirements for FR2.

### 12.4.4 Test Tolerance for additional spurious emissions requirements

The conduced test tolerance for the additional spurious emissions
requirements is zero.

However for OTA BS, the difficulty in measuring TRP of the additional
spurious emissions requirements at low levels close to the measurement
system noise floor means the high risk of false failures. As the risk is
due to the noise floor of the measurement system it cannot be mitigated
by BS design.

As the 3GPP to 3GPP co-existence requirements are not regulatory but set
by RAN4 to assist with co-existence of 3GPP systems in the same
geographical area it is acceptable for RAN4 to set the TT value to be
non-zero.

Hence it has been agreed that for 3GPP to 3GPP co-existence spurious
emissions the TT = MU.

For PHS, and public safety additional requirements the TT = 0 dB.

Some additional requirements such as the protection of PHS and the 700
and 800 MHz public safety bands, are regulatory so it is not possible to
have a non-zero TT, hence for these requirements the TT is zero.

13 Co-location requirements
===========================

13.1 General
------------

This clause collects information on the co-location requirement
procedures in General Chamber, as described in clause 7.7.1.

13.2 OTA transmitter OFF power
------------------------------

### 13.2.1 General

This clause captures MU and TT values derivation for the OTA transmitter
OFF power co-location requirement in Normal test conditions.

OTA transmitter ON/OFF power requirements apply only to TDD operation.

The OTA transmit ON/OFF power requirements are co-location requirements
and specified as the power sum of the supported polarization(s) at the
CLTA conducted output(s).

The FR1 transmitter OFF power and transmitter transient period is a
co-location requirement while the FR2 transmitter OFF power requirement
is a directional requirement.

It is not possible to separate OTA emissions from separate *transceiver
units* therefore OTA emissions requirements are specified as the sum of
the emissions from all *transceiver units* in the BS. For spurious
emissions this has been the case for both conducted and OTA emissions.
The sum of the total emissions from the BS is intended to be no greater
than that of a non-AAS system with equivalent number of MIMO branches
and hence emission are capped at a level consistent with the maximum
MIMO capability of the appropriate RAT (i.e. 8 for E-UTRA and NR, 4 for
UTRA), however conducted TX OFF level is specified per *TAB connector*
and as such is not subject to the same cap. However as the conducted
requirement is primarily concerned with protection of your own receiver
and OTA is concerned with co-location the parameters have somewhat
changed.

As a co-located TDD receiver should be offered the same protection as
any other co-located receiver it is reasonable to apply the same cap on
the TX OFF level as is applied to other unwanted emissions.

The FR1 transmitter OFF power is measured as the conducted output of the
CLTA, no accurate measurements are required in the chamber itself. The
MU analysis of the TX OFF measurement is therefore agnostic to the
chamber used. The chambers main purpose is to shield the BS and the CLTA
form external interference which may influence the result and to avoid
RF reflections which may alter the coupling between the BS and the CLTA.

Hence the MU analysis for FR1 TX OFF is done using a \"General chamber\"
under the assumption that any of the chambers discussed (with the
exception of the Reverb chamber) will be suitable.

### 13.2.2 General Chamber

#### 13.2.2.1 Measurement system description

The General Chamber description for co-location requirements is intended
to cover any suitable chamber type which screens the measurement system
for outside interference and does not affect the coupling between the BS
and the CLTA.

Measurement system description is captured in clause 7.7.1.

#### 13.2.2.2 Test procedure

##### 13.2.2.2.1 Stage 1: Calibration

Calibration for wanted signal power level is the same as in clause 9.2.

Calibration for the CLTA path is described in clause 8.8.

##### 13.2.2.2.2 Stage 2: measurement

The testing procedure consists of the following steps:

1\) Place BS and CLTA as specified for the co-location requirement in
TS 37.145-2 \[4\] clause 4.15 for AAS BS, and in TS 38.141-2 \[6\]
clause 4.12 for NR BS.

2\) Place range antenna in boresight direction (reference direction) at
far-field distance, aligned in both polarizations with the BS.

3\) The Range antenna shall be dual (or single) polarized with the same
frequency range as the BS for transmitter OFF power test case.

4\) Connect range antenna and CLTA to the measurement equipment.

5\) OTA transmitter OFF power is measured at the CLTA conducted
output(s).

6\) The measurement device (signal analyser) characteristics shall be:
Detection mode: True RMS.

7\) Set the BS to transmit:

*-* For BS declared to be capable of single carrier operation only, set
the BS to transmit full beam power (rated beam EIRP), both
polarizations, in boresight direction (reference direction), at
manufacturer\'s declared rated output power, P~rated,t,TRP~.

\- For BS declared to be capable of multi-carrier and/or CA operation,
set the BS to transmit full beam power (rated beam EIRP), both
polarizations, in boresight direction (reference direction) on all
carriers configured using the applicable test configuration and
corresponding power setting.

\- Check that specified beam power (EIRP) is obtained at range antenna
RF output(s) (conducted side) for each polarization. Re-align if the
specified beam power is not achieved.

8\) Measure the mean power spectral density from all CLTA conducted
output(s) over 70 μs filtered with a square filter of bandwidth equal to
the RF bandwidth of the RIB centred on the central frequency of the RF
bandwidth. 70 μs average window centre is set from 35 μs after end of
one *transmitter ON period* + 17 μs to 35 μs before start of next
*transmitter ON period* - 6.25 μs.

Additional factor to be considered in the measurement is that the test
requirement is very close to thermal noise floor, and the measurement
setup needs to be able to tolerate both very high and low signal levels.
This will impact measurement uncertainty.

### 13.2.3 Maximum accepted test system uncertainty

Maximum test system uncertainties derivation methodology was described
in clause 5.1. The maximum accepted test system uncertainty values was
derived based on test system specific values in clause 13.2.2.

Table 13.2.3-1: **Common maximum accepted test system uncertainty**

Fulfilling the criteria for CLTA selection and placement in is deemed
sufficient for the test purposes. When these criteria are met, the
measurement uncertainty related to the selection of the CLTA and its
alignment as shall be used for evaluating the test system uncertainty.

### 13.2.4 Test Tolerance for OTA TX OFF power

Considering the methodology described in clause 5.1, Test Tolerance
values for TX OFF were derived based on values captured in
clause 13.2.3.

The TT was decided to be the same as the MU for TX OFF in FR1.

Table 13.2.4-1: Test Tolerance values for the TX OFF in Normal test
conditions

                        f ≤ 3 GHz   3 \< f ≤ 4.2 GHz   4.2 \< f ≤ 6 GHz

  Test Tolerance (dB)   3.4         3.6                3.6

An overview of the TT values for all the requirements is captured in
clause 18.

13.3 OTA co-location spurious emissions
---------------------------------------

### 13.3.1 General

This clause captures MU and TT values derivation for the OTA co-location
spurious emissions requirement in Normal test conditions.

The FR1 OTA co-location emissions are measured as the conducted output
of the CLTA, no accurate measurements are required in the chamber
itself. The MU analysis of the co-location emissions measurement is
therefore agnostic to the chamber used. The chambers main purpose is to
shield the BS and the CLTA form external interference which may
influence the result and to avoid RF reflections which may alter the
coupling between the BS and the CLTA.

Hence the MU analysis for FR1 co-location emissions is done using a
General Chamber under the assumption that any of the chambers discussed
(with the exception of the Reverberation Chamber) will be suitable.

### 13.3.2 General Chamber

#### 13.3.2.1 Measurement system description

The General Chamber description for co-location requirements is intended
to cover any suitable chamber type which screens the measurement system
for outside interference and does not affect the coupling between the BS
and the CLTA.

Measurement system description is captured in clause 7.7.1.

#### 13.3.2.2 Test procedure

##### 13.3.2.2.1 Stage 1: Calibration

Calibration for wanted signal power level is the same as in clause 9.2.

Calibration for the CLTA path is described in clause 8.8.

##### 13.3.2.2.2 Stage 2: BS measurement

The testing procedure consists of the following steps:

1\) Place BS and CLTA as specified in clause 4.15, TS 37.145-2 \[4\].

2\) Place range antenna in boresight direction (reference direction) at
far-field distance, aligned in both polarizations with the BS.

3\) Connect range antenna and CLTA to the measurement equipment.

4\) OTA co-location spurious emissions are measured at the CLTA
conducted output(s).

5\) The measurement device (signal analyser) characteristics shall be:
Detection mode: True RMS.

6\) Set the BS to transmit:

*-* For BS declared to be capable of single carrier operation only, set
the BS to transmit full beam power (rated beam EIRP), both
polarizations, either simultaneously or sequentially, in boresight
direction (reference direction), at manufacturer\'s declared rated
output power, P~rated,t,TRP~.

\- For BS declared to be capable of multi-carrier and/or CA operation,
set the BS to transmit full beam power (rated beam EIRP), both
polarizations, in boresight direction (reference direction) on all
carriers configured using the applicable test configuration and
corresponding power setting.

\- Check that specified beam power (EIRP) is obtained at Range antenna
RF output(s) (conducted side) for each polarization. Re-align if the
specified beam power is not achieved.

7\) Measure the mean power spectral density from all CLTA conducted
output(s) with each wanted signal polarization under test.

Additional factor to be considered in the measurement is that the test
requirement is very close to thermal noise floor, and the measurement
setup needs to be able to tolerate both very high and low signal levels.
This will impact measurement uncertainty.

### 13.3.3 Maximum accepted test system uncertainty

Maximum test system uncertainties derivation methodology was described
in clause 5.1. The maximum accepted test system uncertainty values was
derived based on test system specific values in clause 13.3.2.

Table 13.3.3-1: **Common maximum accepted test system uncertainty**
value derivation for co-location emissions level measurement

                                                    Expanded uncertainty (dB)

Fulfilling the criteria for CLTA selection and placement in is deemed
sufficient for the test purposes. When these criteria are met, the
measurement uncertainty related to the selection of the CLTA and its
alignment as shall be used for evaluating the test system uncertainty.

### 13.3.4 Test Tolerance co-location spurious emissions

Considering the methodology described in clause 5.1, Test Tolerance
values for co-location emissions were derived based on values captured
in clause 13.3.3.

The TT was decided to be the same as the MU for TX OFF in FR1.

Table 13.3.4-1: Test Tolerance values for the co-location emissions in
Normal test conditions

                        f ≤ 3 GHz   3 \< f ≤ 4.2 GHz   4.2 \< f ≤ 6 GHz

  Test Tolerance (dB)   3.1         3.3                3.4

An overview of the TT values for all the requirements is captured in
clause 18.

13.4 OTA transmitter intermodulation
------------------------------------

### 13.4.1 General

This clause captures MU and TT values derivation for the OTA transmitter
intermodulation co-location requirement in Normal test conditions.

The transmitter intermodulation requirement is that the spurious
emissions requirements (OTA transmitter spurious emissions, OTA
operating band unwanted emissions/SEM and OTA ACLR) are met whilst an
interferer is injected into the antenna from a co-located bases station.

The measurement method and uncertainty for those measurements is the
same as described in clauses 12.2, 11.3 and 11.4.

There is an additional uncertainty however associated with the accuracy
of the interfering signal injected from the CLTA. It is that uncertainty
which is investigated in this clause.

The interferer is injected into the CLTA and the accuracy of this is not
dependent on the chamber type used. The measurement uncertainty
calculation is therefore done using a General Chamber type.

### 13.4.2 General Chamber

#### 13.4.2.1 Measurement system description

This method measures the OTA TX IMD in a General Chamber.

Measurement system description is captured in clause 7.7.1.

#### 13.4.2.2 Test procedure

##### 13.4.2.2.1 Stage 1: Calibration

Calibration for the emissions measurement is the same as in clause 11.3,
11.5 and 12.2.

Calibration for the CLTA path is described in clause 8.8.

##### 13.4.2.2.2 Stage 2: BS measurement

The General Chamber testing procedure consists of the following steps:

1\) Uninstall the reference antenna and install the BS with the
manufacturer declared coordinate system reference point in the same
place as the phase centre of the reference antenna. The manufacturer
declared coordinate system orientation of the BS is set to be aligned
with the testing system.

2\) Set the CLTA as specified in in TS 37.145-2 \[4\] clause 4.15 for
AAS BS, and in TS 38.141-2 \[6\] clause 4.12 for NR BS, at the declared
worst case side.

3\) Set the signal generator to generate the interfering signal to
achieve the required level at the input port of CLTA.

4\) Perform required ACLR, OBUE (for E-UTRA/NR), SEM (for UTRA),
occupied bandwidth, spurious emission tests according to the
corresponding testing procedures.

Table 13.4.2.3-1 captures derivation of the expanded measurement
uncertainty values for OTA transmitter intermodulation measurements in
General Chamber (Normal test conditions, FR1).

sufficient for the test purposes. When these criteria are met, the
measurement uncertainty related to the selection of the CLTA and its

### 13.4.4 Test Tolerance co-location spurious emissions

The test tolerance for the emissions measurements (OTA transmitter
spurious emissions, OTA operating band unwanted emissions/SEM and OTA
ACLR) is as specified for each specific requirement.

The test tolerance for the interferer level is zero.

13.5 OTA co-location blocking
-----------------------------

### 13.5.1 General

This clause 13.5 captures MU and TT values derivation for the OTA
co-location blocking requirement in Normal test conditions.

The OTA co-location blocking measurement uncertainty is calculated as a
combination of the wanted signal MU and the interferer signal MU in the
same way as the normal out of band blocking requirement, where:

$$\text{MU}_{\text{colocation\ blocking}} = \sqrt{\text{MU}_{\text{wanted\ signal}}^{2} + \text{MU}_{\text{interferer}}^{2}} + \text{Noise}_{\text{effect}}$$

The Noise~effect~ from the signal generator is 0.1 dB and the
MU~wantedsignal~ value is MU~EIS~ from clause 10.2.

The measurement uncertainty associated with the interferer is based on
the accuracy of the interfering signal injected from the CLTA. It is
that uncertainty which is investigated in this clause.

The interferer is injected into the CLTA and the accuracy of this is not
dependent on the chamber type used. The measurement uncertainty
calculation is therefore done using a General Chamber type.

Any chamber capable of performing the EIS measurement to the required
accuracy is suitable for the test however.

### 13.5.2 General Chamber

#### 13.5.2.1 Measurement system description

This method measures the OTA co-location blocking characteristics in a
General Chamber.

Measurement system description is captured in clause 7.1.

#### 13.5.2.2 Test procedure

##### 13.5.2.2.1 Stage 1: Calibration

Calibration for wanted signal power level is the same as in clause 10.2.

Calibration for the CLTA path is described in clause 8.8.

##### 13.5.2.2.2 Stage 2: BS measurement

The General Chamber testing procedure consists of the following steps:

1\) Place NR BS and CLTA as specified in TS 37.145-2 \[4\] clause 4.15
for AAS BS, and in TS 38.141-2 \[6\] clause 4.12 for NR BS, at the
declared worst case side. Several CLTA are required to cover the whole
co-location blocking frequency ranges. The CLTA shall be selected
according to clause 6.4.

2\) Align the NR BS and test antenna(s) according to the directions to
be tested.

3\) Connect test antenna and CLTA to the measurement equipment as
depicted in clause 7.7.

5\) The NR BS receives the wanted signal in all supported polarizations,
in the *receiver target reference direction* from the test antenna.

6\) The OTA co-location blocking interferer is injected via the CLTA.
The CLTA is fed with the specified co-location blocking interferer power
per supported polarization.

7\) Generate the wanted signal in *receiver target reference direction*,
all supported polarizations, from the test antenna, according to the
applicable test configuration using applicable reference measurement
channel to the RIB.

8\) Configure the *beam peak direction* for the transmitter units
associated with the RIB under test according to the declared reference
*beam direction pair* for the appropriate beam identifier with the
carrier set-up and power allocation according to the applicable test
configuration(s). The transmitter may be turned OFF for the out-of-band
blocker tests when the frequency of the blocker is such that no IM2 or
IM3 products fall inside the bandwidth of the wanted signal.

9\) Adjust the signal generators to the type of interfering signals,
levels and the frequency offsets as specified for general test
requirements and, when applicable, for co-location test requirements.

10\) The CW interfering signal shall be swept with a step size of 1 MHz
within the frequency range corresponding to downlink operating bands
related to co-located systems.

11\) Measure the performance of the wanted signal at the receiver unit
associated with the RIB.

### 13.5.4 Test Tolerance for OTA co-location blocking

The test tolerance for co-location out of band blocking is zero.

14 Out-of-band blocking requirements
====================================

14.1 General
------------

Clause 14 captures MU and TT values derivation for the OTA out-of-band
blocking requirement in Normal test conditions.

The OTA out-of-band blocking requirement requires both a wanted in-band
signal and an interferer out-of-band signal to be transmitted with the
chamber. The wanted signal is defined in the far field, the interferer
is defined as a field strength, due to the large range for frequencies
it will not always be in the far field.

Hence any acceptable measurement chamber for the OTA sensitivity
requirement measurements (as described in clauses 7.2 to 7.6) is also
suitable for the OTA out-of-band blocking requirement, it may be
necessary that the interfering signal is transmitted from a separate
antenna due to the large frequency range of the interferer.

Figure 14.1-1: General blocking test set-up using a different antenna

In the worst case the wanted and interfering signal are transmitted from
separate test antennas, hence they each may have a different uncertainty
associated with the OTA chamber. This differs from the in-band
interference measurements where the wanted signal and the interferer are
added together outside the chamber and applied to the same test antenna
and hence have a common OTA chamber uncertainty.

The uncertainty of the interferer is analysed in this clause using a
General Chamber assumption (see 7.7.3). The requirement may be tested in
any suitable chamber (e.g. IAC, CATR) that is capable of measuring EIS
accurately and also applying the out-of-band interferer. For interferer
frequencies where it can be applied from a common antenna (like the
in-band requirements) this is acceptable but it is expected the MU will
be lower so will not influence the final MU value. The chosen chamber
must of course be specified to handle the frequency of both the
interferer and the wanted signal. The complete out-of-band blocking test
may be completed using multiple chambers for different frequency ranges
if necessary.

The distance between the test object and test antenna injecting the
interferer signal is adjusted when necessary to ensure specified
interferer signal level to be received.

14.2 General Chamber
--------------------

### 14.2.1 Measurement system description

Measurement system description is captured in clause 7.7.1.

A General Chamber is analysed for the interferer MU value, this is
considered worst case for setting the MU value.

### 14.2.2 Test procedure

#### 14.2.2.1 Stage 1: Calibration

For the wanted signal the calibration procedure and MU for the OTA
sensitivity in clause 10.2 can be assumed for each chamber type and FR.

The interferer path is calibrated using the same method with appropriate
antennas.

#### 14.2.2.2 Stage 2: BS measurement

The General Chamber testing procedure consists of the following steps:

1\) Place test antenna(s) in at appropriate test directions, at
appropriate distance, aligned in all supported polarizations (single or
dual) with the BS.

2\) Connect test antenna(s) to the measurement equipment.

3\) The test antenna(s) shall be dual (or single) polarized covering the
same frequency ranges as the BS and the blocking frequencies. If the
test antenna does not cover both the wanted and interfering signal
frequencies, separate test antennas for the wanted and interfering
signal are required.

4\) The OTA blocking interferer is injected into the test antenna, with
the blocking interferer producing specified interferer field strength
level for each supported polarization. The interferer shall be
*polarization matched* to the BS in band and the position maintained for
OOB measurements.

5\) The BS receives the wanted signal and the interferer signal for all
supported polarizations (single or dual), in the reference direction
from the test antenna(s).

### 14.2.3 MU value derivation, FR1

The MU value for OTA out-of-band blocking consists of the MU value for
the wanted signal and the MU value for the interfering signal.

The unwanted signal is defined as a field strength so can be applied in
the near field with the assumption that the test antenna fully
illuminated the BS under test. For the purposes of calculating a MU
value of the interfering signal the same general out-of-band OTA chamber
used for the TX spurious emissions requirement in clause 12.2 is
assumed.

The out-of-band blocking is analysed using the same methodology as the
other receiver interference requirements where:

The MU~wantedsignal~ of the wanted signal is the same as that for the
OTA sensitivity requirement.

The Noise~effect~ MU from the signal generator for the broad band noise
effect is the same as the conducted requirement (i.e. 0.1 dB).

The MU assessment for the General Chamber is as follows:

Table 14.2.3-1: MU assessment for out-of-band blocking interferer

The OTA chamber is one part of the total interferer MU value. The rest
of the MU is from the conducted signal accuracy, for this the conducted
accuracy is used as a guide. In addition care is taken to ensure the
mismatch is not added twice (from the chamber and the conducted value)
and also it is considered if a PA is needed to achieve sufficient test
signal power level.

The interferer is specified as a field strength of 0.36 V/m, the
required conducted power level depends one chamber size (the FSPL) the
test *antenna gain* and the conducted signal path, and example is given
in table 14.2.3-2.

Table 14.2.3-2: Example of required conducted interferer level

  OOB blocking interferer level               
  ------------------------------- ----------- -----
  Field strength                  0.36        V/m
  d                               4           m
  EIRP                            18.40       dBm
  Antenna                         5           dBi
  Cables, filers, etc.            10          dB
  Signal generator                **23.40**   dBm

Some signal generators can provide 23.4 dBm but it is at the top end so
it is sensible to consider a PA in the test set up.

The MU~interferer~ value is hence given by:

For each of the frequency ranges this gives the value in table 14.2.3-3.

The final MU for the OTA out-of-band blocking requirement is calculated
as follows:

The Noise~effect~ from the signal generator is 0.1 dB and the
MU~wantedsignal~ value is MU~EIS~ from clause 10.2.

The final values are given in table 14.2.3-4:

### 14.2.4 MU value derivation, FR2

It has been agreed that the MU for the out-of-band blocking requirement
can be calculated as follows:

$MU_{\text{OOBB}} = \sqrt[\ ]{MU_{\text{EIS}}^{2} + MU_{\text{OOBint}}^{2} + MU_{\text{PA}}^{2_{\ }^{\ }}}$

15 Demodulation performance requirements
========================================

15.1 General
------------

This clause describes the OTA aspects of the test procedure for
assessing demodulation requirements, based on the analysis of the UTRA
FDD and E-UTRA demodulation requirements which were found feasible OTA,
as captured in clause 15.2. The same principles are to be used for the
analysis of the OTA demodulation performance requirements for NR.

The OTA part of the test procedure is the same for each requirement.

15.2 BS demodulation requirements feasible OTA
----------------------------------------------

The feasibility analysis of the OTA test cases modelling concluded that
the conducted test case with one TX (UE side) and one or two RX chains
(BS side) were identified as candidates for feasible OTA demodulation
cases.

For 2RX case the cross-polarisation is assumed to be used in order to
achieve separation of streams at the RX side of OTA test setup. Most of
the conducted test cases in 1TX-1RX, or 1TX-2RX configuration, can be
implemented in OTA test setups as illustrated in figures 15.3-1 and
15.3-2 for the multipath fading propagation conditions, and in figures
15.3-3 and 15.3-4 for the static propagation conditions.

Based on the analysis of the conducted BS demodulation requirements for
UTRA FDD and E-UTRA, the single RAT requirements considered as feasible
in OTA test setup were listed in tables 15.2-1 and 15.2-2 for UTRA and
E-UTRA. The same principles (i.e. based on cross-polarisation) are to be
used for the analysis of the OTA demodulation performance requirements
for NR.

It is noted, that the possibility of OTA testing is considered also for
those BS demodulation requirements, which were declared as optional.

The OTA related parts of the conformance testing test procedures for the
demodulation requirements are based upon the OTA RX dynamic range
requirement procedure, as described in clause 10.4. The setup and
operation of the signal generator and measurement instruments are the
same as for the corresponding conducted requirements.

The demodulation requirements are in essence very similar to the RX
dynamic range requirement; in both cases a wanted signal and AWGN is
transmitted from the test equipment and should be reassured to be
received at the absolute level well above the noise floor. The test
equipment setup for demodulation requirements may include multiple
wanted and interference signals and a fading channel emulators, as
described in clause 15.3.

15.3 OTA test setup for BS demodulation requirements
----------------------------------------------------

As the BS demodulation requirements rely on the link level performance
between the UE and BS, in case of the requirements definition for the
BS, it is required to establish radio link in uplink based on the test
equipment (i.e. BS Tester test and reference antenna(s)) located within
the RoAoA corresponding to the frequency band used for the BS
demodulation testing.

For PUSCH testing purposes in OTA setup, the HARQ feedback can be
delivered to the BS Tester via conducted interface.

Figure 15.3-1 shows BS measurement test setup for multipath fading
propagation conditions, which is equivalent to the conducted 1TX -- 1RX
test setup.

The OTA BS is comprised in an anechoic chamber and is configured to
receive with single RX configuration. Test signal source is connected to
the single TX test antenna. The radio propagation channel is emulated by
connecting a fading channel emulator between the test signal generator
and the TX antenna.

NOTE: OTA demodulation requirements can be tested in IAC, as well as in
CATR, as outlined in clause 15.4 and 15.5. All the examples of the OTA
test setups for the BS demodulation requirements are based on the IAC
test setup.

AWGN noise floor levels required in the conformance test setup are to be
derived from conducted BS demodulation test setup procedures. Wanted
signal generators are configured so that the SNR levels defined by the
demodulation requirements are achievable at the BS. For SNR derivation,
the noise injection at the BS tester side is considered as the baseline
approach.

signal source is connected to the 2TX tests antenna in cross-polarised
configuration. The two orthogonal radio propagation channels are
emulated by passing the same test signal trough one fading channel
emulator for each of TX antennas.

### 15.4.1 Measurement system description

The general IAC test setup for demodulation requirements is the same as
that for OTA dynamic range, i.e. the same as described in clause 7.2.1.
For more detailed test setup with the consideration of the channel
simulators, AWGN noise generators as well as the polarization separation
for 2RX setup, refer to the figures in clause 15.3.

### 15.4.2 Test procedure

#### 15.4.2.1 Stage 1: Calibration

The calibration procedure for demodulation requirements is the same as
that for OTA dynamic range, i.e. the same as described in clause 7.2.1
and depicted in figure 7.2.1-3. Calibration of the wanted signal and
AWGN levels shall be performed.

#### 15.4.2.2 Stage 2: BS measurement

The IAC measurement procedure is the same as those for the OTA
sensitivity requirement in clause 10.2.2.2.2, except that step 5 is
modified to measure applicable performance metric for the BS
demodulation requirements (i.e. BER, or throughput, depending on the RAT
and requirement).

The transmit signal power level may be set in the same manner as for OTA
dynamic range; i.e. by considering the AWGN absolute levels referenced
from appropriate conducted RAT-specific testing specifications, together
with an adjustment Δ~OTAREFSENS~ to take into account BS *antenna gain*
(path loss is taken account of by the calibration procedure). Examples
of the AWGN power levels for the E-UTRA PUSCH requirements are listed in
table 15.4.2.2-1 (AWGN levels for other requirements can be found in the
conducted single RAT specifications).

Table 15.4.2.2-1: examples of the AWGN power level at the BS input for
E-UTRA demodulation requirements

  ------------------------- --------------------------------------
  Channel bandwidth (MHz)   AWGN power level
  1.4                       -92.7 - Δ~OTAREFSENS~ dBm / 1.08 MHz
  3                         -88.7 - Δ~OTAREFSENS~ dBm / 2.7 MHz
  5                         -86.5 - Δ~OTAREFSENS~ dBm / 4.5 MHz
  10                        -83.5 - Δ~OTAREFSENS~ dBm / 9 MHz
  15                        -81.7 - Δ~OTAREFSENS~ dBm / 13.5 MHz
  20                        -80.4 - Δ~OTAREFSENS~ dBm / 18 MHz
  ------------------------- --------------------------------------

### 15.4.3 MU value derivation, FR1

The BS demodulation requirements consist of a wanted signal and AWGN
(potentially with fading modelling and additional interfering signals).
In the conducted test setup, the received AWGN level is well above the
noise floor, and so the SNR experienced at the BS receiver is dependent
on the transmitter SNR/SINR (in case of E-UTRA) or E~b~/N~0~ (in case of
UTRA).

Small variations in the received power level due to additional
uncertainties in the OTA measurement chamber will not impact the
receiver SNR, and hence uncertainties due to OTA will not impact the
demodulation requirement MU. The MU can be considered to depend on the
TX SNR/SINR (in case of E-UTRA) or on the TX ~b~/N~0~ (in case of UTRA)
and, where applicable the fading channel generation uncertainty, in the
same manner as for the conducted requirements.

Thus, the MU for OTA demodulation requirements is the same as the MU for
conducted demodulation requirements, as derived in RAT-specific
conducted testing specifications:

\- TS 25.141 \[2\] for UTRA FDD

\- TS 36.141 \[3\] for E-UTRA

\- TS 38.141-1 \[5\] for NR

The resulting test requirements for OTA BS can be reused from the above
conducted test specifications, as long as the SNR/SINR (in case of
E-UTRA and NR) or the TX ~b~/N~0~ (in case of UTRA) at the BS receiver
is not impacted by the noise floor due to the OTA test chamber path
loss.

15.5 Compact Antenna Test Range
-------------------------------

### 15.5.1 Measurement system description

The general CATR test setup for demodulation requirements is the same as
that for OTA dynamic range, i.e. the same as described in clause 7.3.1
and the measurement system setup for OTA dynamic range depicted on
figure 7.3.1-3. For more detailed test setup with the consideration of
the channel simulators, AWGN noise generators as well as the
polarization separation for 2RX setup, refer to the figures in
clause 15.3.

### 15.5.2 Test procedure

#### 15.5.2.1 Stage 1: Calibration

The calibration procedure for demodulation requirements is the same as
that for OTA dynamic range, as described in clause 8.3 and depicted on
figure 7.3.1-3. Calibration of the wanted signal and AWGN levels shall
be performed.

#### 15.5.2.2 Stage 2: BS measurement

The CATR measurement procedure is the same as those for the OTA dynamic
range requirement in clause 10.4.3.2.2, except that step 4 is modified
to measure applicable performance metric for the BS demodulation
requirements (i.e. BER, or throughput, depending on the RAT and
requirement).

The transmit signal power level may be set in the same manner as
described in clause 15.4.2.2 (i.e. BS demodulation requirements in IAC).

### 15.5.3 MU value derivation, FR1

The MU for OTA demodulation requirements is the same as for conducted
demodulation requirements for the same reasons as applicable for the
indoor anechoic chamber, described in clause 15.4.3.

15.6 Maximum accepted test system uncertainty

C, clause C.3.

16 EMC requirements
===================

16.1 BS ports for the EMC purposes
----------------------------------

The OTA AAS BS architecture does not have a conducted interface and so
the antennas cannot be disconnected. This means that the conducted
methods where the *EMC antenna port*s are terminated are no longer be
possible and hence new methods for EMC testing are needed.

Figure 8.1-1 shows the prime difference in architecture from an EMC view
point when comparing the ports on a conventional non-AAS BS to the ports
on an AAS BS.

height="1.3680555555555556in"}

Figure 8.1-1: Comparison between BS architectures for EMC testing

Since the *antenna array* for the OTA AAS BS is integrated within the
BS, the transmissions from the BS within the test chamber have *antenna
gain* included in them.

Figure 8.1-2 illustrates the status of *EMC antenna port*s during EMC
testing where it is noted that the ports are connected to a terminating
load and the *hybrid AAS BS* is then set to transmit at full power.

height="1.5277777777777777in"}

Figure 8.1-2: *EMC Antenna port* status during EMC testing

16.2 Field strength in EMC chamber
----------------------------------

### 16.2.1 General

This clause provides an example estimation of field strength within the
EMC chamber. Assuming free space propagation loss in an anechoic
chamber, the path loss can be calculated as:

![](media/image131.wmf){width="1.2152777777777777in"
height="0.5208333333333334in"},

where Gt and Gr are the *antenna gain*s (with respect to an isotropic
radiator) of the transmitting and receiving antennas respectively, λ is
the wavelength, and R is the distance between the TX and RX.

Assuming a 0dBi *antenna gain* for the TX and RX, the isotropic free
space path loss is plotted in figure 8.3.1-1 for 30, 1000, 2000, 4000,
6000 and 12000 MHz.

![](media/image132.emf){width="3.6597222222222223in" height="2.75in"}

Figure 16.2.1-1: Free-space path loss, assuming G~t~=G~r~=0 dBi

It can be noted that for a typical distance between the BS and the probe
antenna within the chamber, (e.g. 5 meters), the path loss at 2 GHz is
more than 50 dB. However, if the BS has an integrated antenna which has
gain, and the measurement probe antenna also has gain the total loss
between the BS and the measurement equipment may drop. For example, a BS
with TX *antenna gain* = 10 dBi and assuming 10 dBi *antenna gain* for
the probe antenna, the coupling loss at 5 meters is roughly 30 dB, i.e.
20 dB lower than the coupling loss assuming 0 dBi *antenna gain*s. With
this observation, and the fact the AAS BS is transmitting and connected
to its integrated antenna, it can be contemplated that an AAS BS leads
to significantly increased field strength within the chamber compared to
the usual EMC measurement scenario where the transmitters are connected
to terminating loads. This increased field strength and associated
received power from the measurement probe could potentially damage the
test equipment.

### 16.2.2 Conversion between dBm to V/m

Since the field strength within the EMC chamber is expressed in terms of
electric field strength (i.e. V/m), it is important to establish the
intensity of electric field strength generated when transmitting at a
certain power (dBm). This conversion exists in prior art and is
explained in \[20\]. In summary, for a free space wave impedance of 377
ohm, the electric field (V/m) can be expressed as:

Where R is the distance of BS from the interferer (during the immunity
testing).

This formula provides us a way to calculate the field strength within
the chamber.

16.3 Protection of measurement equipment
----------------------------------------

In order to protect the measurement device from the increased field
strength levels within the EMC chamber during the spurious emission
testing. Traditionally in EMC testing as the BS transmitters are working
into a load the received signal from the EMC test antenna is at a low
power level which can be fed directly into the measurement equipment.
With the AAS BS testing as the transmitter units are radiating through
the AAS BS antenna the transmit signal received at the measurement
device is of a high power. In order to protect the measurement device
from this signal, the device needs to ensure additional attenuation by
filtering out the wanted signal with a notch or band stop filter.
Additionally, TX exclusion bands similar to those used in existing
conducted spurious emissions requirements may need to be defined in
certain areas to ensure that the increased field strength does not
block/damage the measurement device.

The existing RAT-specific frequency boundary limits defined for
out-of-band emissions by the SEM or OBUE requirements in
TS 37.105 \[14\] is a sufficient boundary to limit exposure of the
measurement\'s equipment receiver from the high field strengths of the
wanted signal.

16.4 Emission requirements
--------------------------

In terms of transmitter spurious emission, two types of core
requirements specified for AAS BS are relevant:

1\. The RF spurious emission requirements specified in TS 37.105 \[14\]
with different measurement bandwidths and spurious emission levels as
detailed in SM.329 \[15\].

2\. The EMC radiated emission requirements specified in TS 37.114 \[17\]
with the same measurement bandwidths as the RF spurious emission
requirements.

In terms of the applicability of the RF Radiated Spurious Emission (RF
RSE) and EMC Radiated Emission (EMC RE) requirements in the OTA setup,
according to the existing conducted requirements, these requirements
apply from 30 MHz to 12.75 GHz with consideration of exceptions:

\- Unwanted emissions: the RF RSE requirement apply at frequencies
within the above specified frequency range with the exception of the
UTRA spectrum emission mask (SEM) and E-UTRA operating band unwanted
emissions (OBUE) ranges specified in single RAT and MSR specifications.

\- Upper frequency: in order for the RF RSE requirement to comply with
the SM.329 recommendation \[15\], for certain operating bands the upper
limit of the spurious range is extended beyond 12.75 GHz to the limit of
5^th^ harmonic (but not higher than 26 GHz). For more details on the
upper limit setting in those cases, refer to SM.329 \[15\].

The applicability of EMC RE and RF RSE requirements is illustrated in
figure 16.4-1 below

Figure 16.4-1: Applicability of spurious emission requirements

It is to be noted that these EMC RE requirements are applicable at the
enclosure port and the *EMC antenna port* is connected to a terminating
load while the AAS BS is transmitting at full power. The EMC RE are then
tested in this setup to make sure that the requirements are fulfilled.

For the OTA AAS BS architecture that does have the possibility of
disconnecting the composite antenna, the *EMC antenna port*s can no
longer be connected to a terminating load. This means that the RF RSE
and EMC RE requirements cannot be differentiated any needs to be
considered as single OTA requirement specified at the enclosure of the
BS. The single requirement contains a RF RSE component and an EMC RE
component as shown in figure 16.4-1 and the total emission requirement
is as specified in the SM.329 \[15\] recommendation.

Mechanism to specify the regional and additional co-existence
requirements is not covered by the present release of this technical
report.

16.5 Radiated immunity requirements
-----------------------------------

### 16.5.1 General

When performing EMC RI tests of an OTA AAS BS or *BS type 1-O*, due to
lack of the antenna connectors a higher power level may, for certain
test scenarios, enter the RX of the BS, while for a *hybrid AAS* BS the
antenna connectors would be terminated during test preventing this to
happen. This may lead to the receiver of the OTA AAS BS or *BS type 1-O*
being inoperable (in case the RF blocking requirements are not met). To
avoid the OTA AAS BS or *BS type 1-O* receiver being inoperable during
the EMC RI test, protection mechanisms need to be employed for BS RX
during the RI testing.

NOTE: Within Rel-15 timeframe, there were no EMC Radiated Immunity
requirement defined for FR2 and *BS type 2-O*.

### 16.5.2 Measurement set-up for testing radiated immunity

In an EMC RI testing test setup for non-AAS BS products, the antenna
connectors of the BS are terminated during test to prevent high power
levels entering the RX of the BS. For the AAS BS architectures such as
*BS type 1-O*, due to lack of the antenna connectors (called TAB
connectors in case of AAS BS products), it is not possible to terminate
TAB connectors and prevent disturbances affecting the RX chain. This may
lead to the receiver of the *BS type 1-O* being inoperable (in case the
RF blocking requirements are not met). To avoid the *BS type 1-O*
receiver being inoperable during the EMC RI test, protection mechanisms
need to be employed for BS RX during the RI testing.

A high level example of EMC RI test setup for an OTA AAS BS is
illustrated in figure 16.5.2-1. The BS is placed in an anechoic chamber
on top of a turn table. A range antenna or probe antenna generates the
interfering RF electromagnetic field.

![](media/image135.png){width="2.9583333333333335in"
height="2.6597222222222223in"}

Figure 16.5.2-1: Example radiated immunity test setup for a *BS type
1-O*

An important difference of the EMC radiated immunity test setup for a
*BS type 1-O* as compared with testing of the BS equipped with the
antenna connectors is the need for OTA performance parameter monitoring.
During EMC RI test the BS is rotated horizontally in order to expose it
to the interfering RF electromagnetic field from all directions in
horizontal plane.

According to IEC 61000-4-3 \[25\], all testing of equipment shall be
performed in a configuration as close as possible to actual installation
conditions. In order to allow electromagnetic susceptibility testing of
the maximum surface for *BS type 1-O*, the BS shall be mounted using
rack (or pole) mount, if possible.

### 16.5.2 Alternatives to protect *BS type 1-O* during RI test

3GPP has agreed on the use of two mechanisms to protect the BS during RI
testing:

\- Exclusion bands, or

\- Spatial exclusion.

The combined use of these two alternatives is reflected in both AAS BS
EMC specification TS 37.114 \[17\] and the NR BS EMC specification
TS 38.113 \[18\].

#### 16.5.2.1 Exclusion bands

Exclusion bands were considered as a mechanism to protect the receiver
from potential damage/undue stress during the RI test of the non-AAS BS
products so far, where the exclusion bands represent a range of
frequencies over which no tests are made.

During the discussion of Release 15, the need for widening the size of
the exclusion bands in TS 37.113 \[16\], TS 37.114 \[17\] and
TS 38.113 \[18\] has been recognized. The parameter proposed to get this
extension was the boundary of the in-band and out-of-band region,
represented by the maximum offset of the out-of-band boundary from the
uplink operating band edge (i.e. ∆f~OOB~). The value of ∆f~OOB~ was
derived considering the width of the NR operating band and was agreed to
be:

\- 20 MHz, for operating bands narrower than 100 MHz, or

\- 60 MHz, for operating bands wider than 100 MHz.

The above ∆f~OOB~ values considered the use of spatial exclusion during
the EMC RI testing.

Before the significant risk to over-dimension the Rx band filter for *BS
type 1-O*, the need for using a value higher than ∆f~OOB~ to calculate
the exclusion bands size was agreed for the test case with no spatial
exclusion being considered. In this case the exclusion band takes into
account the width of the operating band as follows:

\- 60 MHz, for operating bands narrower than 100 MHz, or

\- 200 MHz, for operating bands wider than 100 MHz.

#### 16.5.2.2 Spatial exclusion

According to IEC 61000-4-3 \[19\], the EMC Radiated Immunity test is
performed with the generating antenna facing each side of the BS. When
technically justified, some BS can be tested by exposing fewer faces to
the generating antenna. For *BS type 1-O* the RI test need to be reduced
to fewer angular incidences. This is to protect the BS receiver from
being blocked due to received input power levels exceeding the OOB
blocking limits during the RI testing. Referring to the IEC
61000-4-3 \[19\] guidance above, the angular incidence where the front
of the *BS type 1-O* is facing the interferer range antenna needs to be
omitted, as depicted in figure 16.7.2.2-1.

######## Annex A (informative): Radiated TX measurement error contribution descriptions

A.1 Indoor Anechoic Chamber
===========================

This clause describes measurement uncertainty contributors for TX
measurements in Indoor Anechoic Chamber.

NOTE 1: Several MU contributor descriptions are defined in a way
combining both BS for the measurement stage and calibration/reference
antenna for calibration stage, e.g. for A1-4 this contribution is
denoted as A1-4a for polarization mismatch between the BS and the
receiving antenna, and as A1-4b for polarization mismatch between the
reference antenna and the receiving antenna.

**A1-1 Positioning misalignment between the BS and the reference
antenna**

This contribution originates from the misalignment of the manufacturer
declared coordinate system reference point of the BS and the phase
centre of the reference antenna. The uncertainty makes the space
propagation loss between the BS and the receiving antenna at the BS
measurement stage (i.e. Stage 2) different from the space propagation
loss between the reference antenna and the receiving antenna at the
calibration stage (i.e. Stage 1).

**A1-2 Pointing misalignment between the BS and the receiving antenna**

This contribution originates from the misalignment of the testing
direction and the *beam peak direction* of the receiving antenna due to
imperfect rotation operation. The pointing misalignment may happen in
both azimuth and vertical directions and the effect of the misalignment
depends highly on the beamwidth of the beam under test. The same level
of misalignment results in a larger measurement error for a narrower
beam.

**A1-3 Quality of quiet zone (normal test conditions)**

This contribution originates from a reflectivity level of an anechoic
chamber. The reflectivity level is determined from the average standard
deviation of the electric field in the quiet zone. By repeating a free
space VSWR measurement in 15° grid in elevation and azimuth, 264
standard deviation values in both polarizations are determined. From
these values an average standard deviation of electric field in the
quiet zone can be calculated from the equation:

Where:

is the number of angular intervals in elevation,

is the number of angular intervals in azimuth, and

is elevation of single measurement .

If an efficiency calibration with omni-directional calibration antenna
is performed, the effect of reflectivity level decreases in Stage 1
(i.e. calibration measurement) and may be divided by factor 2. This is
due to correcting impact of data averaging in this type of calibration.
Efficiency calibration done with sampling step ≤ 30°, can be considered
to have at least four independent samples. may be divided by factor 2
also in Stage 2 (i.e. BS measurement) for the same reason.

It\'s likely that asymmetry of the field probe will have a very small
impact on this measurement uncertainty contributor, however, an upper
bound to probe symmetry should be considered.

NOTE 2: This MU contributor is defined for normal test conditions. MU
contributor for the quality of QZ in extreme test conditions is defined
in A1-17.

**A1-4 Polarization mismatch between the BS (a) / reference antenna (b)
and the receiving antenna**

This contribution originates from the misaligned polarization between
the BS/reference antenna and the receiving antenna.

**A1-5 Mutual coupling between the BS(a) / reference antenna (b) and the
receiving antenna**

This contribution originates from mutual coupling between the
BS/reference antenna and the receiving antenna. Mutual coupling degrades
not just the antenna efficiency, i.e. the EIRP value, but it can alter
the antenna\'s *radiation pattern* as well. For indoor anechoic chamber,
usually the spacing between the BS/reference antenna and the receiving
antennas is large enough so that the level of mutual coupling might be
negligible.

**A1-6 Phase curvature**

This contribution originates from the finite far field measurement
distance, which causes phase curvature across the antenna of
BS/reference antenna.

**A1-7 Impedance mismatch in the receiving chain**

This contribution originates from multiple reflections between the
receiving antenna and the power measurement equipment. The multiple
reflections can produce an overall reflection that depends not only upon
the individual reflections of each part but their reflective
interactions as well. The combination loss by the overall reflection can
be higher or lower than individual loss by multiple reflections. The
combination loss is called the mismatch error and leads to the
measurement uncertainty.

**A1-8 Random uncertainty**

The random uncertainty characterizes the undefined and miscellaneous
effects which cannot be forecasted. One can estimate this type of
uncertainty with a repeatability test by making a series of repeated
measurement with a reference BS without changing anything in the
measurement set-up.

**A1-9 Impedance mismatch between the receiving antenna and the network
analyzer**

This contribution originates from multiple reflections between the
receiving antenna and the network analyzer. After appropriate
calibration, the network analyzer may not introduce impedance mismatch
error, but the error still happens between the receiving antenna feed
cable and the receiving antenna.

**A1-10 Positioning and pointing misalignment between the reference
antenna and the receiving antenna**

This contribution originates from reference antenna alignment and
pointing error. In this measurement if the maximum gain directions of
the reference antenna and the receiving antenna are aligned to each
other, this contribution can be considered negligible and therefore set
to zero.

**A1-11 Impedance mismatch between the reference antenna and the network
analyzer**

This contribution originates from multiple reflections between the
reference antenna and the network analyzer. After appropriate
calibration, the network analyzer may not introduce impedance mismatch
error, but the error still happens between the reference antenna feed
cable and the reference antenna.

**A1-12 Influence of the reference antenna feed cable**

In the calibration Stage 1, the influence of the calibration antenna
feed cable is assessed by measurements. A measurement for calibration
may be repeated with a reasonably differing routing of the feed cable.
Largest difference among the results is entered to the uncertainty
budget with a rectangular distribution.

**A1-13 Reference antenna feed cable loss measurement uncertainty**

Before performing the calibration, the reference antenna feed cable loss
have to be measured. The measurement can be done with a network analyzer
to measure its S~21~ and uncertainty is introduced.

**A1-14 Influence of the receiving antenna feed cable**

If the probe antenna is directional (i.e. peak gain \>+5 dBi, e.g. horn,
LPDA, etc.) and the same probe antenna cable configuration is used for
both stages, the uncertainty is considered systematic and constant 0.00
dB value.

In other cases a technical study should be done.

**A1-15 Uncertainty of the absolute gain of the receiving antenna**

The uncertainty appears in both stages and it is thus considered
systematic and constant 0.00 dB value.

**A1-16 Frequency flatness of test system**

This uncertainty contribution to account for the frequency interpolation
error caused by a finite frequency resolution during the calibration
stage.

**A1-17 Quality of quiet zone (extreme test conditions)**

This contribution is related to the ambient quality of the quiet zone
for normal test conditions (i.e. A1-3) which originates from a
reflectivity level of an anechoic chamber. The reflectivity level is
determined from the average standard deviation of the electric field in
the quiet zone. As the environmental enclosure is larger than the BS and
the material of the environmental chamber may cause some reflection and
refraction the quite zone flatness will be effected. The quality of the
quiet zone for the extreme test is therefore larger that for the ambient
due to the environmental enclosures effect.

NOTE 3: This MU contributor is defined for extreme test conditions. MU
contributor for the quality of QZ in normal test conditions is defined
in A1-3.

**A1-18 Wet radome loss variation**

The environmental chamber radome will be an ineffective thermal isolator
and will have extreme temperatures on the inside and the OTA chamber
ambient temperature on the outside. In such conditions condensation is
inevitable. This uncertainty is due to the variation in the radome loss
due to condensation on the environmental chamber radome.

**A1-19 Radome loss variation**

The environmental chamber radome will affect the path between the BS and
the test antenna due to both its insertion loss and also reflection and
refraction from the materials surface. The loss is dependent on the
material as well as its proximity to the BS. The uncertainty is the
residual uncertainly of the total loss after calibration.

**A1-20 Change in absorber behaviour**

The environmental chamber will contain RF absorptive material to prevent
reflections within the chamber. This RF absorptive material will be
subjected to the extreme temperatures inside the environmental chamber
and hence its properties will change. This uncertainty accounts for the
effect of that change in behavior.

**A1-21** **Uncertainty of the LNA (FR2 only)**

To maintain a low noise figure for the measurement system (possibly
considering the addition of a down conversion mixer for high
frequencies) and LNA may be required. The variation in the gain of the
LNA after the calibration procedure is accounted for in this uncertainty
contribution.

**A1-22** **Uncertainty of the Mixer (FR2 only)**

Higher frequency emissions beyond the upper frequency range of the
measurement equipment require down converting prior to measurement. The
uncertainty introduced by the down conversion is accounted for in this
uncertainty contribution.

A.2 Compact Antenna Test Range
==============================

This clause describes measurement uncertainty contributors for TX
measurements in Compact Antenna Test Range.

NOTE 1: Several MU contributor descriptions are defined in a way
combining both BS for the measurement stage and calibration/reference
antenna for calibration stage, e.g. for A1-4 this contribution is
denoted as A1-4a for polarization mismatch between the BS and the
receiving antenna, and as A1-4b for polarization mismatch between the
reference antenna and the receiving antenna.

**A2-1 Misalignment and pointing error of BS (a) /calibration antenna
(b) (for EIRP)**

This contribution denotes uncertainty in BS/calibration antenna
alignment and BS/calibration antenna pointing error. In this measurement
the BS/calibration antenna is aligned to maximum, also allowing for a
zero contribution for polarization mismatch uncertainty. By adjusting
for maximums to align, this contribution can be a small contribution.
The calibration antenna\'s phase centre and polarization purity changes
slightly according to the frequency. Therefore, there should be some
uncertainty reserved for this. To ensure that the point error is at a
minimal, this contribution should be captured using the antenna pattern
cut which is broadest (in the case of the BS this would most likely be
in the azimuth domain).

NOTE 2: This MU contributor used different values for the EIRP
measurement and for TRP measurement. Therefore, those two were
explicitly differentiated in the MU derivation tables, i.e. A2-1 for
EIRP, A2-18 for TRP.

**A2-2 Standing wave between BS (a) / calibration antenna (b) and test
range antenna**

This value is extracting the uncertainty value and standard deviation of
gain ripple coming from standing waves between BS and test range
antenna. This value can be captured by moving the BS towards the test
range antenna as the standing waves go in and out of phase causing a
ripple in measured gain.

**A2-3 RF leakage (SGH connector terminated & test range antenna
connector cable terminated)**

This contribution denotes noise leaking in to connector and cable(s)
between test range antenna and receiving equipment. The contribution
also includes the noise leakage between the connector and cable(s)
between SGH/reference antenna and transmitting equipment.

**A2-4 QZ ripple experienced by BS (a) /calibration antenna (b) (normal
test conditions)**

This is the quiet zone (QZ) ripple experienced by the BS/calibration
antenna during the measurement or calibration phase. The purpose of this
component is to capture the contributions that the reflections from the
walls, roof and floor that will add to the EIRP measurement. The sum of
all these reflections from the walls, range reflector (if applicable),
roof and floor will give the overall value for the QZ ripple. In other
words, the uncertainty component from the wall will not be separated
from the roof or the floor. The purpose of this uncertainty component is
to capture the overall reflections from the chamber walls experienced by
the BS/calibration antenna. To capture the full effect of the QZ ripple
a distance of 1λ should be measured from each of the BS/calibration
antenna physical aperture edges, i.e. total QZ distance = physical
aperture length +2 λ, to ensure the full volume of the QZ is captured in
the uncertainty measurement.

NOTE 3: This MU contributor is defined for normal test conditions. MU
contributor for the quality of QZ in extreme test conditions is defined
in A2-13.

**A2-5 Mismatch of receiver chain (i.e. between receiving antenna and
measurement receiver (a) / low power receiver (b))**

This uncertainty is the residual uncertainty contribution coming from
multiple reflections between the receiving antenna and the test receiver
equipment. This value can be captured through measurement by measuring
the S~11~ towards the receive antenna and also towards the test
receiver. The mismatch between the antenna reflection and the receiver
reflection can also be calculated. If the same cable is used for
calibration Stage 1, this can be considered systematic and negligible.

**A2-6 Insertion loss of receiver chain**

This uncertainty is the residual uncertainty contribution coming from
introducing an antenna at the end of the cable. If this cable does not
change/move between the calibration Stage 1 and the measurement Stage 2,
the uncertainty is assumed to be systematic and negligible during the
measurement stage. Alternatively, the insertion loss can also be
calculated by taking the measurement of the cable where port 2 is the
end of the cable connected to the BS or calibration antenna.

IL = -20log~10~\|S~21~\| dB

**A2-7 Influence of the calibration antenna feed cable (i.e. flexing
cables, adapters, attenuators, extra pathloss cable & connector
repeatability)**

During the calibration phase this cable is used to feed the calibration
antenna and any influence it may have upon the measurements is captured.
This is assessed by repeated measurements while flexing the cables and
rotary joints. The largest difference between the results is recorded as
the uncertainty.

**A2-8 Misalignment positioning system**

This contribution originates from uncertainty in sliding position and
turn table angle accuracy. If the calibration antenna is aligned to
maximum this contribution can be considered negligible and therefore set
to zero.

**A2-9 Rotary joints**

If applicable the contribution of this uncertainty the accuracy in
changing from azimuth to vertical measurements.

**A2-10 Miscellaneous uncertainty**

The term \'miscellaneous uncertainty\' is used to define all the
unknown, unquantifiable, etc. uncertainties associated with EIRP
measurements. This term should include truly random effects as well as
systematic uncertainties, such as that arising from dissimilarity
between the patterns of the reference antenna (SGH) and the BS.

**A2-11 Switching uncertainty**

The purpose of the switching unit is to switch electromechanically
different RF path to different measurement instruments of different
measurement modes. The electromechanical switching clearly reduces the
errors arising from manual switching work. Switching is also used to
measure the path loss values of each polarization component. Even though
the electromechanical switching is preferable during path loss and
antenna performance measurements, some minor uncertainties can occur
when the switch states are programmed to change their polarity.

**A2-12 Frequency flatness of test system**

This uncertainty contribution to account for the frequency interpolation
error caused by a finite frequency resolution during the calibration
stage.

**A2-13 Quality of quiet zone (extreme test conditions)**

This contribution is related to the ambient quality of the quiet zone
for normal test conditions (A2-4) which originates from a reflectivity
level of an anechoic chamber. The reflectivity level is determined from
the average standard deviation of the electric field in the quiet zone.
As the environmental enclosure is larger than the BS and the material of
the environmental chamber may cause some reflection and refraction the
quite zone flatness will be effected. The quality of the quiet zone for
the extreme test is therefore larger that for the ambient due to the
environmental enclosures effect.

**A2-14 Wet radome loss variation**

The environmental chamber radome will be an ineffective thermal isolator
and will have extreme temperatures on the inside and the OTA chamber
ambient temperature on the outside. In such conditions condensation is
inevitable. This uncertainty is due to the variation in the radome loss
due to condensation on the environmental chamber radome.

**A2-15 Radome loss variation**

The environmental chamber radome will affect the path between the BS and
the test antenna due to both its insertion loss and also reflection and
refraction from the materials surface. The loss is dependent on the
material as well as its proximity to the BS. The uncertainty is the
residual uncertainly of the total loss after calibration.

**A2-16 Change in absorber behaviour**

The environmental chamber will contain RF absorptive material to prevent
reflections within the chamber. This RF absorptive material will be
subjected to the extreme temperatures inside the environmental chamber
and hence its properties will change. This uncertainty accounts for the
effect of that change in behavior.

**A2-17 Measurement system dynamic range uncertainty**

Uncertainty associated with the addition of each of the directional
power measurements to calculate the TRP due to the limited dynamic range
of the OTA test system causing an overestimation.

**A2-18 Misalignment and pointing error of BS (a) /calibration antenna
(b) (for TRP)**

This contribution denotes uncertainty in BS/calibration antenna
alignment and BS/calibration antenna pointing error and its effect on
the TRP calculation. The pointing error for TRP emissions measurement is
larger than for EIRP (A2-1).

NOTE 4: This MU contributor used different values for the EIRP
measurement and for TRP measurement. Therefore, those two were
explicitly differentiated in the MU derivation tables, i.e. A2-1 for
EIRP, A2-18 for TRP.

**A2-19** **Uncertainty of the LNA (FR2 only)**

To maintain a low noise figure for the measurement system (possibly
considering the addition of a down conversion mixer for high
frequencies) and LNA may be required. The variation in the gain of the
LNA after the calibration procedure is accounted for in this uncertainty
contribution

**A2-20** **Uncertainty of the mixer (FR2 only)**

Higher frequency emissions beyond the upper frequency range of the
measurement equipment require down converting prior to measurement. The
uncertainty introduced by the down conversion is accounted for in this
uncertainty contribution.

A.3 Near Field Test Range
=========================

This clause describes measurement uncertainty contributors for TX
measurements in Near Field Test Range.

**A3-1 Axes intersection**

This is a mechanical uncertainty term and aim to find the uncertainty
related with the lateral displacement between the horizontal and
vertical axes of the BS positioner. This can result in sampling the
field on a non-ideal sphere. This uncertainty is assumed to have a
Gaussian distribution.

**A3-2 Axes orthogonality**

The difference from 90° of the angle between the horizontal and vertical
axes also results in sampling the field on a non-ideal sphere. This
uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.

**A3-3 Horizontal pointing**

The horizontal mispointing of the horizontal axis to the probe reference
point for Theta=0° also results in sampling the field on a non-ideal
sphere. This uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.

**A3-4 Probe vertical position**

The vertical displacement of the probe reference point from the
horizontal axis results in sampling the field on a non-ideal sphere.
This uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.

**A3-5 Probe horizontal/vertical pointing**

The horizontal or vertical mispointing of the probe z-axis from the
intersection point of the horizontal/vertical axis. This uncertainty is
assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.

**A3-6 Measurement distance**

This is the knowledge of the distance between the intersection point of
the horizontal and vertical axis and probe reference point. This
uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.

**A3-7 Amplitude and phase drift**

The system drift due to temperature variations the signal at BS location
to drift in amplitude and phase. This uncertainty is assumed to have a
Gaussian distribution.

**A3-8 Amplitude and phase noise**

This uncertainty is due to the noise level of the test range so that the
S/N ratio should be determined or measured at the BS location. The noise
level is usually measured with a Spectrum Analyzer. This uncertainty is
assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.

**A3-9 Leakage and crosstalk**

This uncertainty can be addressed by measurements on the actual system
setup. The leakage and crosstalk cannot be separated from the random
amplitude and phase errors so that the relative importance should be
determined. This uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.

**A3-10 Amplitude non-linearity**

This uncertainty is the linearity of the receiver used for the
measurement. It can be taken from the data sheet of the receiver.

**A3-11 Amplitude and phase shift in rotary joint**

This uncertainty is due to the variation of the rotary joint. It can be
measured and is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.

**A3-12 Channel balance amplitude and phase**

This uncertainty is relevant for systems which are using dual polarized
probes and polarization switches. The amplitude and phase difference
between two signal channels of the receiver includes the difference
between the probe ports, difference between the channels of the
polarization switch, connecting cables and reflection coefficients. This
uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.

**A3-13 Probe polarization amplitude and phase**

The amplitude and phase of the probe polarization coefficients should be
measured. This uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.

**A3-14 Probe pattern knowledge**

The probe(s) pattern(s) is assumed to be known so that the BS
measurement in near field can be corrected when performing the near
field to far field transform. There is no direct dependence between the
BS pattern and the probe pattern in near field measurements. This
uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.

**A3-15 Multiple reflections**

The multiple reflections occur when a portion of the transmitted signal
is reflected form the receiving antenna back to the transmitting antenna
and re-reflected by the transmitting antenna back to the receiving
antenna. This uncertainty can be determined by multiple measurements of
the BS when at different distance from the probes. This uncertainty is
assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.

**A3-16 Room scattering**

As for the multiple reflections, a portion of the transmitted signal is
reflected by either the absorbers or other structures in the measurement
anechoic chamber before being received by the receiving antenna. This
effect can be isolated from the multiple reflections by testing the BS
in different positions, separated by λ/4 with respect to the anechoic
chamber and comparing these measurements with the reference. This
uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.

**A3-17 BS support scattering**

This is the uncertainty due to the BS supporting structure on the signal
level. This uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.

**A3-18 Scan area truncation**

This uncertainty does affect this near field measurement. It can be
addressed by comparing the measurement result when scanning the full
area. This uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.

**A3-19 Sampling point offset**

This uncertainty has an influence in near field and far field. It is
assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.

**A3-20 Spherical mode truncation**

The measured near field is expanded using a finite set of spherical
modes. The number of modes is linked to number of samples. The filtering
effect generated by the finite number of modes can improve measurement
results by removing signals from outside the physical area of the BS.
Care should be taken in order to make sure the removed signals are not
from the BS itself. This uncertainty is usually negligible.

**A3-21 Positioning**

The relative position of the probe array is not ideal. This uncertainty
is assumed to have a rectangular distribution.

**A3-22 Probe array uniformity**

This is the uncertainty due to the fact that different probes are used
for each physical position. Different probes have different *radiation
patterns*. Generally, the probe array is calibrated so that the
uniformity of the probes is achieved.

**A3-23 Mismatch of receiver chain**

If the same chain configuration (including the measurement receiver; the
probe antenna and other elements) is used in both stages, the
uncertainty is considered systematic and constant 0.00 dB value.

If it is not the case, this uncertainty contribution has to be taken
into account and should be measured or determined by the method
described in TR 25.914 \[24\]. This uncertainty is assumed to have a
U-shaped distribution.

**A3-24 Insertion loss of receiver chain**

It is composed of the following:

\- Insertion loss of the probe antenna cable.

\- Insertion loss of the probe antenna attenuator (if used).

\- Insertion loss of RF relays (if used).

If the same chain configuration is used for measurement and calibration,
the uncertainty due to the above components is considered systematic and
constant 0.00 dB value. This uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian
distribution.

**A3-25 Uncertainty of the absolute gain of the probe antenna**

This uncertainty appears in the both stages and it is thus considered
systematic and constant 0.00 dB value.

**A3-26 Measurement repeatability - positioning repeatability**

This uncertainty is due to the repositioning of the BS in the test
setup. It can be addressed by repeating the corresponding measurement 5
times. Calculate the standard deviation of the metric obtained and use
that as the measurement uncertainty. For tests that require multiple
setups, the worst-case standard deviation is used. This uncertainty is
assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.

**A3-27 Mismatch of receiver chain**

If the same chain configuration (including the measurement receiver; the
probe antenna and other elements) is used in both stages, the
uncertainty is considered systematic and constant 0.00 dB value.

If it is not the case, each uncertainty contribution has to be taken
into account and should be measured or determined and then taking the
total of all non-zero mismatch uncertainty contribution from all parts
by root-sum-squares (RSS) method. This uncertainty is assumed to have a
Gaussian distribution.

**A3-28 Insertion loss of receiver chain**

If the same chain configuration is used for measurement and calibration,
the uncertainty due to the above components is considered systematic and
constant 0.00 dB value. This uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian
distribution.

**A3-29 Mismatch in the connection of the calibration antenna**

This is the uncertainty from the mismatch in the connection between the
system coax cable and the calibration antenna. This uncertainty is from
the mismatch between the cable and the reference antenna that is used
for calibration. It is determined by the S~11~ of the reference antenna
and the S~11~ of the cable to which the antenna is connected i.e. if
using an SGH antenna for calibration and 10 dB pad is inserted on the
cable connecting to the antenna this uncertainty contribution can be
considered negligible. This uncertainty is assumed to have a U-shaped
distribution.

**A3-30 Influence of the calibration antenna feed cable**

This uncertainty is due to the impact of the feeding cable on the
radiation properties of the calibration antenna. In case of using either
a standard horn or standard gain horn, the impact of the cable is to be
considered negligible thus the uncertainty 0.00 dB value. In case of
using a dipole-like antenna, the uncertainty should be addressed by
measuring this impact. This uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian
distribution.

**A3-31 Influence of the probe antenna cable**

If the same chain configuration is used for measurement and calibration,
the uncertainty due to the above components is considered systematic and
constant 0.00 dB value. This uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian
distribution.

**A3-32 Short term repeatability**

It can be addressed by performing a repeatability test of the
calibration antenna. This uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian
distribution.

**A3-33 Frequency flatness of test system**

This uncertainty contribution to account for the frequency interpolation
error caused by a finite frequency resolution during the calibration
stage.

A.4 One Dimensional Compact Range
=================================

This clause describes measurement uncertainty contributors for TX
measurements in One Dimensional Compact Range.

NOTE: Several MU contributor descriptions are defined in a way combining
both BS for the measurement stage and calibration/reference antenna for
calibration stage, e.g. for A1-4 this contribution is denoted as A1-4a
for polarization mismatch between the BS and the receiving antenna, and
as A1-4b for polarization mismatch between the reference antenna and the
receiving antenna.

**A4-1 Misalignment and pointing error of BS**

This contribution denotes uncertainty in BS alignment and BS pointing
error. In this measurement the BS is aligned to maximum, also allowing
for a zero contribution for polarization mismatch uncertainty. By
adjusting for maximums to align, this contribution can be a small
contribution. The reference antenna´s phase centre and polarization
purity changes slightly according to the frequency. Therefore, there
should be some uncertainty reserved for this. To ensure that the
pointing error is at a minimal, this contribution should be captured
using the antenna pattern cut which is broadest (in the case of the BS
this would most likely be in the azimuth domain).

**A4-2 Standing wave between BS (a) / reference antenna (b) and test
range antenna**

This value is extracting the uncertainty value and standard deviation of
gain ripple coming from standing waves between BS and test range
antenna. This value can be captured by moving the BS towards the test
range antenna as the standing waves go in and out of phase causing a
ripple in measured gain.

**A4-3 Quiet zone ripple experienced by BS (a) / reference antenna (b)**

This is the quiet zone (QZ) ripple experienced by the BS/reference
antenna during the measurement phase. The purpose of this component is
to capture the contributions that the reflections from the walls, roof
and floor that will add to the EIRP measurement. The sum of all these
reflections from the walls, range reflector (if applicable), roof and
floor will give the overall value for the QZ ripple. In other words, the
uncertainty component from the wall will not be separated from the roof
or the floor. The purpose of this uncertainty component is to capture
the overall reflections from the chamber walls experienced by the
BS/reference antenna. To capture the full effect of the QZ ripple a
distance of 1λ must be measured from each of the BS/reference antenna
physical aperture edges, i.e. total QZ distance = physical aperture
length + 2 λ, to ensure the full volume of the QZ is captured in the
uncertainty measurement.

**A4-4 Phase curvature across the BS antenna (a) / reference antenna
(b)**

This contribution originates from the finite far field measurement
distance, which causes phase curvature across the antenna of BS (a) /
reference antenna (b).

**A4-5 Polarization mismatch between BS (a) / reference antenna (b) and
receiving antenna**

This contribution originates from the misaligned polarization between
the BS/reference antenna and the receiving antenna.

**A4-6 Mutual coupling between BS (a) / reference antenna (b) and
receiving antenna**

This contribution originates from mutual coupling between the
BS/reference antenna and the receiving antenna. Mutual coupling degrades
not just the antenna efficiency, i.e. the EIRP value, but it can alter
the antenna\'s *radiation pattern* as well. For compact range chamber,
usually the spacing between the BS/reference antenna and the receiving
antennas is large enough so that the level of mutual coupling might be
negligible.

**A4-7 Impedance mismatch in receiving chain**

This contribution originates from multiple reflections between the
receiving antenna and the measurement equipment. The multiple
reflections can produce an overall reflection that depends not only upon
the individual reflections of each part but their reflective
interactions as well. The combination loss by the overall reflection can
be higher or lower than individual loss by multiple reflections. The
combination loss is called the mismatch error and leads to the
measurement uncertainty.

**A4-8 RF leakage (BS (a) / SGH (b) connector terminated and test range
antenna connector cable terminated)**

This contribution denotes noise leaking into connector and cable(s)
between test range antenna and receiving equipment. The contribution
also includes the noise leakage between the connector and cable(s)
between SGH/reference antenna and transmitting equipment.

**A4-9 Misalignment positioning system**

This contribution originates from uncertainty in sliding position and
turn table angle accuracy. If the calibration antenna is aligned to
maximum this contribution can be considered negligible and therefore set
to zero.

**A4-10 Pointing error between reference antenna and test range
antenna**

This contribution originates from the misalignment of the testing
direction and the *beam peak direction* of the receiving antenna due to
imperfect rotation operation. The pointing misalignment may happen in
both azimuth and vertical directions and the effect of the misalignment
depends highly on the beamwidth of the beam under test. The same level
of misalignment results in a larger measurement error for a narrower
beam.

**A4-11 Impedance mismatch in path to reference antenna**

This contribution originates from multiple reflections between the
reference antenna and the measurement equipment. After appropriate
calibration, the measurement equipment may not introduce impedance
mismatch error, but the error still happens between the reference
antenna feed cable and the reference antenna.

**A4-12 Impedance mismatch in path to compact probe**

This contribution originates from multiple reflections between the
receiving antenna and the measurement equipment. After appropriate
calibration, the measurement equipment may not introduce impedance
mismatch error, but the error still happens between the receiving
antenna feed cable and the receiving antenna.

**A4-13 Influence of reference antenna feed cable (i.e. flexing cables,
adapters, attenuators, connector repeatability)**

During the calibration phase this cable is used to feed the reference
antenna and any influence it may have upon the measurements is captured.
This is assessed by repeated measurements while flexing the cables and
rotary joints. The largest difference between the results is recorded as
the uncertainty.

**A4-14 Mismatch of receiver chain (i.e. between receiving antenna and
measurement equipment)**

This uncertainty is the residual uncertainty contribution coming from
multiple reflections between the receiving antenna and the test receiver
equipment. This value can be captured through measurement by measuring
the S~11~ towards the receive antenna and also towards the test
receiver. The mismatch between the antenna reflection and the receiver
reflection can also be calculated. If the same cable is used for
calibration stage, this can be considered systematic and negligible.

**A4-15 Insertion loss of receiver chain**

This uncertainty is the residual uncertainty contribution coming from
introducing an antenna at the end of the cable. If this cable does not
change/move between the calibration and the measurement stage, the
uncertainty is assumed to be systematic and negligible during the
measurement stage. Alternatively, the insertion loss can also be
calculated by taking the measurement of the cable where port 2 is the
end of the cable connected to the BS or reference antenna.

IL = -20log~10~\|S~21~\| dB

A.5 General Chamber
===================

This clause describes the measurement uncertainty contributors for TX
measurements in General Chamber.

NOTE: Several MU contributor descriptions are defined in a way combining
both BS for the measurement stage and calibration/reference antenna for
calibration stage, e.g. for A1-4 this contribution is denoted as A1-4a
for polarization mismatch between the BS and the receiving antenna, and
as A1-4b for polarization mismatch between the reference antenna and the
receiving antenna.

**A5-1 Positioning misalignment between the BS and the reference
antenna**

This contribution originates from the misalignment of the manufacturer
declared coordinate system reference point of the BS and the phase
centre of the reference antenna. The uncertainty makes the space
propagation loss between the BS and the receiving antenna at the BS
measurement stage (i.e. Stage 2) different from the space propagation
loss between the reference antenna and the receiving antenna at the
calibration stage (i.e. Stage 1).

**A5-2 Pointing misalignment between the BS and the receiving antenna**

This contribution originates from the misalignment of the testing
direction and the *beam peak direction* of the receiving antenna due to
imperfect rotation operation. The pointing misalignment may happen in
both azimuth and vertical directions and the effect of the misalignment
depends highly on the beamwidth of the beam under test. The same level
of misalignment results in a larger measurement error for a narrower
beam.

**A5-3 Quality of quiet zone**

This contribution originates from a reflectivity level of an anechoic
chamber. The reflectivity level is determined from the average standard
deviation of the electric field in the quiet zone. By repeating a free
space VSWR measurement in 15° grid in elevation and azimuth, 264
standard deviation values in both polarizations are determined. From
these values an average standard deviation of electric field in the
quiet zone can be calculated from the equation:

Where:

is the number of angular intervals in elevation,

is the number of angular intervals in azimuth, and

is elevation of single measurement .

If an efficiency calibration with omni-directional calibration antenna
is performed, the effect of reflectivity level decreases in Stage 1
(i.e. calibration measurement) and may be divided by factor 2. This is
due to correcting impact of data averaging in this type of calibration.
Efficiency calibration done with sampling step ≤ 30°, can be considered
to have at least four independent samples. may be divided by factor 2
also in Stage 2 (i.e. BS measurement) for the same reason.

It\'s likely that asymmetry of the field probe will have a very small
impact on this measurement uncertainty contributor, however, an upper
bound to probe symmetry should be considered.

**A5-4 Polarization mismatch between the BS (a) /reference antenna (b)
and the receiving** antenna

This contribution originates from the misaligned polarization between
the BS/reference antenna and the receiving antenna.

**A5-5 Mutual coupling between the BS (a) /reference antenna (b) and the
receiving antenna**

This contribution originates from mutual coupling between the
BS/reference antenna and the receiving antenna. Mutual coupling degrades
not just the antenna efficiency, i.e. the EIRP value, but it can alter
the antenna\'s *radiation pattern* as well. For indoor anechoic chamber,
usually the spacing between the BS/reference antenna and the receiving
antennas is large enough so that the level of mutual coupling might be
negligible.

**A5-6 Phase curvature across the BS antenna (a) /reference antenna
(b)**

This contribution originates from the finite far field measurement
distance, which causes phase curvature across the antenna of BS (a)
/reference antenna (b).

**A5-7 Impedance mismatch in the receiving chain**

This contribution originates from multiple reflections between the
receiving antenna and the power measurement equipment. The multiple
reflections can produce an overall reflection that depends not only upon
the individual reflections of each part but their reflective
interactions as well. The combination loss by the overall reflection can
be higher or lower than individual loss by multiple reflections. The
combination loss is called the mismatch error and leads to the
measurement uncertainty.

**A5-8 Random uncertainty**

The random uncertainty characterizes the undefined and miscellaneous
effects which cannot be forecasted. One can estimate this type of
uncertainty with a repeatability test by making a series of repeated
measurement with a reference BS without changing anything in the
measurement set-up.

**A5-9 Impedance mismatch between the receiving antenna and the network
analyzer**

This contribution originates from multiple reflections between the
receiving antenna and the network analyzer. After appropriate
calibration, the network analyzer may not introduce impedance mismatch
error, but the error still happens between the receiving antenna feed
cable and the receiving antenna.

**A5-10 Positioning and pointing misalignment between the reference
antenna and the receiving antenna**

This contribution originates from reference antenna alignment and
pointing error. In this measurement if the maximum gain directions of
the reference antenna and the receiving antenna are aligned to each
other, this contribution can be considered negligible and therefore set
to zero.

**A5-11 Impedance mismatch between the reference antenna and the network
analyzer**

This contribution originates from multiple reflections between the
reference antenna and the network analyzer. After appropriate
calibration, the network analyzer may not introduce impedance mismatch
error, but the error still happens between the reference antenna feed
cable and the reference antenna.

**A5-12 Influence of the reference antenna feed cable**

In the calibration Stage 1, the influence of the calibration antenna
feed cable is assessed by measurements. A measurement for calibration
may be repeated with a reasonably differing routing of the feed cable.
Largest difference among the results is entered to the uncertainty
budget with a rectangular distribution.

**A5-13 Reference antenna feed cable loss measurement uncertainty**

Before performing the calibration, the reference antenna feed cable loss
have to be measured. The measurement can be done with a network analyzer
to measure its S~21~ and uncertainty is introduced.

**A5-14 Influence of the receiving antenna feed cable**

If the probe antenna is directional (i.e. peak gain \>+5 dBi, e.g. horn,
LPDA, etc.) and the same probe antenna cable configuration is used for
both stages, the uncertainty is considered systematic and constant 0.00
dB value.

In other cases a technical study should be done.

**A5-15 Uncertainty of the absolute gain of the receiving antenna**

The uncertainty appears in both stages and it is thus considered
systematic and constant 0.00 dB value.

**A5-16 Frequency flatness of test system**

This uncertainty contribution to account for the frequency interpolation
error caused by a finite frequency resolution during the calibration
stage.

**A5-17 Measurement antenna frequency variation**

For wide band measurement the measurement *antenna gain* will vary
considerably over frequency. The gain can be calibrated however
variation may still remain between calibration frequency steps. This
uncertainty accounts for the variation between the calibrated steps.

**A5-18 FSPL estimation error**

For wide band measurement the measurement free space path loss in the
chamber will vary with frequency. The loss can be calibrated however
this uncertainty accounts for the variation between the calibrated
steps.

**A5-19 Measurement system dynamic range uncertainty**

Uncertainty associated with the addition of each of the directional
power measurements to calculate the TRP due to the limited dynamic range
of the OTA test system causing an overestimation.

**A5-20 Reflections in anechoic chamber**

Uncertainty associated with the reflections in the chamber changing the
coupling between the BS and the CLTA.

A.6 Reverberation Chamber
=========================

This clause describes measurement uncertainty contributors for TX
measurements in Reverberation Chamber.

**A6-1 Impedance mismatch in the receiving chain**

This contribution originates from multiple reflections between the
receiving antenna and the power measurement equipment. The multiple
reflections can produce an overall reflection that depends not only upon
the individual reflections of each part but their reflective
interactions as well. The combination loss by the overall reflection can
be higher or lower than individual loss by multiple reflections. The
combination loss is called the mismatch error and leads to the
measurement uncertainty.

**A6-2 Random uncertainty**

The random uncertainty characterizes the undefined and miscellaneous
effects which cannot be forecasted. One can estimate this type of
uncertainty with a repeatability test by making a series of repeated
measurement with a reference BS without changing anything in the
measurement set-up.

**A6-3 Reference antenna radiation efficiency**

This contribution is a residue of uncertainty of reference antenna
radiation efficiency after calibration.

**A6-4 Mean value estimation of reference antenna mismatch efficiency**

This contribution originates from the error of the estimated mean
related to the use of a finite number $\text{N\ }$of samples in the
measurement of the reference antenna mismatch efficiency. The mean value
estimation is calculated as $\sigma\text{/}\sqrt{N}$ where $\sigma$ is
the standard deviation of the series of measured values.

**A6-5 Influence of the reference antenna feed cable**

Before performing the calibration, the reference antenna feed cable loss
has to be measured. The measurement can be done with a network analyzer
to measure its S~21~ and uncertainty is introduced.

**A6-6 Mean value estimation of transfer function**

This contribution originates from the error of the estimated mean
related to the use of a finite number $N$ of samples in the measurement
of the transfer function. The mean value estimation is calculated as
$\sigma\text{/}\sqrt{N}$ where $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the
series of measured values.

**A6-7 Uniformity of transfer function**

Standard deviation over BS positions and rotations of the transfer
function $\left\langle \left| S_{21} \right|^{2} \right\rangle$. This
uncertainty expresses the variations of measured TRP values with respect
to translations and rotations of the BS. Ideally, the TRP does neither
depend on translations nor rotations of the BS.

A.7 Plane Wave Synthesizer
==========================

This clause describes measurement uncertainty contributors for TX
measurements in Plane Wave Synthesizer.

NOTE: Several MU contributor descriptions are defined in a way combining
both BS for the measurement stage and calibration/reference antenna for
calibration stage, e.g. for A1-4 this contribution is denoted as A1-4a
for polarization mismatch between the BS and the receiving antenna, and
as A1-4b for polarization mismatch between the reference antenna and the
receiving antenna.

**A7-1 Misalignment and pointing error of BS (a) /calibration antenna
(b)**

This contribution denotes uncertainty in BS/calibration antenna
alignment and BS/calibration antenna pointing error. In this measurement
the BS/calibration antenna is aligned to maximum, also allowing for a
zero contribution for polarization mismatch uncertainty. By adjusting
for maximums to align, this contribution can be a small contribution.
The calibration antenna\'s phase centre and polarization purity changes
slightly according to the frequency. Therefore, there should be some
uncertainty reserved for this. To ensure that the point error is at a
minimal, this contribution should be captured using the antenna pattern
cut which is broadest (in the case of the BS this would most likely be
in the azimuth domain).

**A7-2 Longitudinal position uncertainty (i.e. standing wave and
imperfect field synthesis) for BS antenna (a) / calibration antenna
(b)**

This value covers the effect of standing wave between BS or calibration
antenna and the test range antenna, but also counts for the PWS
imperfect field synthesis over distance. This value can be captured by
moving the BS or calibration antenna towards the test range antenna.

**A7-3 RF leakage (calibration antenna connector terminated)**

This contribution denotes noise leaking in to connector and cable(s)
between test range antenna and receiving equipment. The contribution
also includes the noise leakage between the connector and cable(s)
between reference antenna and transmitting equipment.

**A7-4** **QZ ripple experienced by BS (a) /calibration antenna (b)**

This is the quiet zone (QZ) ripple experienced by the BS/reference
antenna during the measurement phase. The purpose of this component is
to capture the contributions that the reflections from the walls, roof
and floor that will add to measurements. The sum of all these
reflections from the walls, roof and floor will give the overall value
for the QZ ripple. In other words, the uncertainty component from the
wall will not be separated from the roof or the floor. The purpose of
this uncertainty component is to capture the overall reflections from
the chamber walls experienced by the BS/reference antenna.

**A7-5 Miscellaneous uncertainty**

The term \'miscellaneous uncertainty\' is used to define all the
unknown, unquantifiable, etc. uncertainties associated with EIRP
measurements. This term should include truly random effects as well as
systematic uncertainties, such as that arising from dissimilarity
between the patterns of the reference antenna and the BS.

**A7-6 Mismatch (i.e. reference antenna, network analyser and reference
cable)**

This uncertainty is the residual uncertainty contribution coming from
multiple reflections between the receiving antenna and the test receiver
equipment. This value can be captured through measurement by measuring
the S~11~ towards the receive antenna and also towards the test
receiver. The mismatch between the antenna reflection and the receiver
reflection can also be calculated. If the same cable is used for
calibration Stage 1, this can be considered systematic and negligible.

**A7-7 Insertion loss of receiver chain**

This uncertainty is the residual uncertainty contribution coming from
introducing an antenna at the end of the cable. If this cable does not
change/move between the calibration Stage 1 and the measurement Stage 2,
the uncertainty is assumed to be systematic and negligible during the
measurement stage. Alternatively, the insertion loss can also be
calculated by taking the measurement of the cable where port 2 is the
end of the cable connected to the BS or calibration antenna.

IL = -20log~10~\|S~21~\| dB

**A7-8 Influence of the calibration antenna feed cable (i.e. flexing
cables, adapters, attenuators, extra pathloss cable & connector
repeatability)**

During the calibration phase this cable is used to feed the calibration
antenna and any influence it may have upon the measurements is captured.
This is assessed by repeated measurements while flexing the cables and
rotary joints. The largest difference between the results is recorded as
the uncertainty.

**A7-9 Misalignment of positioning system**

This contribution originates from uncertainty in sliding position and
turn table angle accuracy. If the calibration antenna is aligned to
maximum this contribution can be considered negligible and therefore set
to zero.

**A7-10 Rotary joints**

If applicable, this uncertainty term corresponds to the accuracy in
changing from azimuth to vertical measurements.

**A7-11 Switching uncertainty**

The purpose of the switching unit is to switch electromechanically
different RF path to different measurement instruments of different
measurement modes. The electromechanical switching clearly reduces the
errors arising from manual switching work. Switching is also used to
measure the path loss values of each polarization component. Even though
the electromechanical switching is preferable during path loss and
antenna performance measurements, some minor uncertainties can occur
when the switch states are programmed to change their polarity.

**A7-12 Field repeatability**

Each execution of field calibration of the measurement *antenna array*
to find the PWS settings provides a slightly different set of settings
for the RF components for each antenna path. This results in variation
of the synthesized plane wave in the QZ and variation of PWS antenna to
reference antenna coupling. This variation is described by field
repeatability term.

**A7-13 Frequency flatness of test system**

This uncertainty contribution to account for the frequency interpolation
error caused by a finite frequency resolution during the calibration
stage.

**A7-14 System non-linearity**

This uncertainty term is calculated as RSS of the following items,
assuming a rectangular distribution:

\- System non-linearity in time. This is assessed by repeated
measurements over a period of time (e.g. 60 minutes) for the same
reference power transmitted by the reference antenna. The largest
difference between the results is recorded as the uncertainty.

\- System non-linearity in power. This is assessed by repeated
measurements over a range of transmitted powers. The largest delta
between the increments on the receiving side versus the transmitting
side is recorded as the uncertainty.

######## Annex B (informative): Radiated RX measurement error contribution descriptions

B.1 Indoor Anechoic Chamber
===========================

This clause describes measurement uncertainty contributors for RX
measurements in Indoor Anechoic Chamber.

NOTE: Several MU contributor descriptions are defined in a way combining
both BS for the measurement stage and calibration/reference antenna for
calibration stage, e.g. for A1-4 this contribution is denoted as A1-4a
for polarization mismatch between the BS and the receiving antenna, and
as A1-4b for polarization mismatch between the reference antenna and the
receiving antenna.

**B1-1 Positioning misalignment between the BS and the reference
antenna**

This contribution originates from the misalignment of the manufacturer
declared coordinate system reference point of the BS and the phase
centre of the reference antenna. The uncertainty makes the space
propagation loss between the BS and the transmitting antenna at the BS
measurement stage (i.e. Stage 2) different from the space propagation
loss between the reference antenna and the transmitting antenna at the
calibration stage (i.e. Stage 1).

**B1-2 Pointing misalignment between the BS and the transmitting
antenna**

This contribution originates from the misalignment of the testing
direction and the *beam peak direction* of the transmitting antenna due
to imperfect rotation operation. The pointing misalignment may happen in
both azimuth and vertical directions and the effect of the misalignment
depends highly on the beamwidth of the beam under test. The same level
of misalignment results in a larger measurement error for a narrower
beam.

**B1-3 Quality of quiet zone**

This contribution originates from a reflectivity level of an anechoic
chamber. The reflectivity level is determined from the average standard
deviation of the electric field in the quiet zone. By repeating a free
space VSWR measurement in 15 ° grid in elevation and azimuth, 264
standard deviation values in both polarizations are determined. From
these values an average standard deviation of electric field in the
quiet zone can be calculated from the equation:

where:

is the number of angular intervals in elevation,

is the number of angular intervals in azimuth, and

is elevation of single measurement .

If an efficiency calibration with omni-directional calibration antenna
is performed, the effect of reflectivity level decreases in Stage 1
(i.e. calibration measurement) and may be divided by factor 2. This is
due to correcting impact of data averaging in this type of calibration.
Efficiency calibration done with sampling step ≤ 30°, can be considered
to have at least four independent samples. may be divided by factor 2
also in stage 2 (i.e. BS measurement) for the same reason.

It\'s likely that asymmetry of the field probe will have a very small
impact on this measurement uncertainty contributor, however, an upper
bound to probe symmetry should be considered.

**B1-4 Polarization mismatch between the BS (a) / reference antenna (b)
and the transmitting antenna**

This contribution originates from the misaligned polarization between
the BS (a) /reference antenna (b) and the transmitting antenna.

**B1-5 Mutual coupling between the BS (a) /reference antenna (b) and the
transmitting antenna**

This contribution originates from mutual coupling between the BS (a)
/reference antenna (b) and the transmitting antenna. Mutual coupling
degrades not just the antenna efficiency, but it can alter the
antenna\'s *radiation pattern* as well. For indoor anechoic chamber,
usually the spacing between the transmitting antenna and the
BS/reference antenna is large enough so that the level of mutual
coupling might be negligible.

**B1-6 Phase curvature**

This contribution originates from the finite far-field measurement
distance, which causes phase curvature across the antenna of the
BS/reference antenna.

**B1-7 Impedance mismatch in the transmitting chain**

This contribution originates from multiple reflections between the
transmitting antenna and the signal generator. The multiple reflections
can produce an overall reflection that depends not only upon the
individual reflections of each part but their reflective interactions as
well. The combination loss by the overall reflection can be higher or
lower than individual loss by multiple reflections. The combination loss
is called the mismatch error and leads to the measurement uncertainty.

**B1-8 Random uncertainty**

The random uncertainty characterizes the undefined and miscellaneous
effects which cannot be forecasted. One can estimate this type of
uncertainty with a repeatability test by making a series of repeated
measurement with a reference BS without changing anything in the
measurement set-up.

**B1-9 Impedance mismatch between the transmitting antenna and the
network analyzer**

This contribution originates from multiple reflections between the
transmitting antenna and the network analyzer. After appropriate
calibration, the network analyzer may not introduce impedance mismatch
error, but the error still happens between the transmitting antenna feed
cable and the transmitting antenna.

**B1-10 Positioning and pointing misalignment between the reference
antenna and the transmitting antenna**

This contribution originates from reference antenna alignment and
pointing error. In this measurement if the maximum gain direction of the
reference antenna and the transmitting antenna are aligned to each
other, this contribution can be considered negligible and therefore set
to zero.

**B1-11 Impedance mismatch between the reference antenna and the network
analyzer**

This contribution originates from multiple reflections between the
reference antenna and the network analyzer. After appropriate
calibration, the network analyzer may not introduce impedance mismatch
error, but the error still happens between the transmitting antenna feed
cable and the transmitting antenna.

**B1-12 Influence of the reference antenna feed cable**

In the calibration Stage 1, the influence of the calibration antenna
feed cable is assessed by measurements. A measurement for calibration
may be repeated with a reasonably differing routing of the feed cable.
Largest difference among the results is entered to the uncertainty
budget with a rectangular distribution.

**B1-13 Reference antenna feed cable loss measurement uncertainty**

Before performing the calibration, the reference antenna feed cable loss
have to be measured. The measurement can be done with a network analyzer
to measure its S~21~ and uncertainty is introduced.

**B1-14 Influence of the transmitting antenna feed cable**

If the probe antenna is directional (i.e. peak gain \>+5 dBi e.g. horn,
LPDA, etc.) and the same probe antenna cable configuration is used for
both stages, the uncertainty is considered systematic and constant 0.00
dB value.

**B1-15 Uncertainty of the absolute gain of the transmitting antenna**

The uncertainty appears in both stages and it is thus considered
systematic and constant 0.00 dB value.

B.2 Compact Antenna Test Range
==============================

This clause describes measurement uncertainty contributors for RX
measurements in Compact Antenna Test Range.

NOTE: Several MU contributor descriptions are defined in a way combining
both BS for the measurement stage and calibration/reference antenna for
calibration stage, e.g. for A1-4 this contribution is denoted as A1-4a
for polarization mismatch between the BS and the receiving antenna, and
as A1-4b for polarization mismatch between the reference antenna and the
receiving antenna.

**B2-1 Misalignment and pointing error of BS (a) /calibration antenna
(b)**

This contribution denotes uncertainty in BS (a) /calibration antenna (b)
alignment and BS (a) /calibration antenna (b) pointing error. In this
measurement the BS (a) /calibration antenna (b) is aligned to maximum,
also allowing for a zero contribution for polarization mismatch
uncertainty. By adjusting for maximums to align, this contribution can
be a small contribution. The calibration antenna\'s phase centre and
polarization purity changes slightly according to the frequency.
Therefore, there should be some uncertainty reserved for this. To ensure
that the point error is at a minimal, this contribution should be
captured using the antenna pattern cut which is broadest (in the case of
the BS this would most likely be in the azimuth domain).

**B2-2 Standing wave between BS and test range antenna**

This value is extracting the uncertainty value and standard deviation of
gain ripple coming from standing waves between BS and test range
antenna. This value can be captured by moving the BS towards the test
range antenna as the standing waves go in and out of phase causing a
ripple in measured gain.

**B2-3 RF leakage & dynamic range, test range antenna cable connector
terminated**

This contribute denotes noise leaking in to connectors and cables
between test range antenna and receiving equipment.

**B2-4 QZ ripple experienced by BS (a) /calibration antenna (b)**

This is the quiet zone ripple experienced by the BS (a) /calibration
antenna (b) during the measurement phase. The purpose of this component
is to capture the contributions that the reflections from the walls,
roof and floor that will add to the EIS measurement. The sum of all
these reflections from the walls, roof and floor will give the overall
value for the QZ ripple. In other words, the uncertainty component from
the wall will not be separated from the roof or the floor. The purpose
of this uncertainty component is to capture the overall reflections from
the chamber walls experienced by the BS (a) /calibration antenna (b). To
capture the full effect of the QZ ripple a distance of 1λ should be
measured from each of the BS (a) /calibration antenna (b) physical
aperture edges, i.e. total QZ distance = physical aperture length + 2 λ,
to ensure the full volume of the QZ is captured in the uncertainty
measurement.

**B2-5 Mismatch of transmit chain (i.e. between transmitting measurement
antenna and BS)**

This uncertainty is the residual uncertainty contribution coming from
multiple reflections between the transmitting antenna and the signal
generation equipment. This value can be captured through measurement by
measuring the S~11~ towards the transmit antenna and also towards the
test signal generator equipment. The mismatch between the antenna
reflection and the transmit reflection can also be calculated.

**B2-6 Insertion loss of transmit chain**

This uncertainty is the residual uncertainty contribution coming from
introducing an antenna at the end of the cable. If this cable does not
change/move between the calibration Stage 1 and the BS measurement Stage
2, the uncertainty is assumed to be systematic. Alternatively, the
insertion loss can also be calculated by taking the measurement of the
cable where port 2 is the end of the cable connected to the measurement
antenna.

IL = -20log~10~\|S~21~\| dB

**B2-7 RF leakage (SGH connector terminated & test range antenna
connector terminated)**

This contribution denotes noise leaking in to connector and cable(s)
between test range antenna and receiving equipment. The contribution
also includes the noise leakage between the connector and cable(s)
between SGH/reference antenna and transmitting equipment.

**B2-8 Influence of the calibration antenna feed cable (i.e. flexing
cables, adapters, attenuators & connector repeatability)**

During the calibration phase this cable is used to feed the calibration
antenna and any influence it may have upon the measurements is captured.
This is assessed by repeated measurements while flexing the cables and
rotary joints. The largest difference between the results is recorded as
the uncertainty.

**B2-9 Miscellaneous uncertainty**

The term \'miscellaneous uncertainty\' is used to define all the
unknown, unquantifiable, etc. uncertainties associated with EIRP
measurements. This term should include truly random effects as well as
systematic uncertainties, such as that arising from dissimilarity
between the patterns of the reference antenna (SGH) and the BS.

**B2-10 Rotary joints**

If applicable the contribution of this uncertainty is the accuracy in
changing from azimuth to vertical measurements.

**B2-11 Misalignment positioning system**

This contribution originates from uncertainty in sliding position and
turn table angle accuracy. If the calibration antenna is aligned to the
maximum then this contribution can be considered negligible and
therefore set to zero.

**B2-12 Standing wave between SGH and test range antenna**

This value is extracting the uncertainty value and standard deviation of
gain ripple coming from standing waves between BS and test range
antenna. This value can be captured by moving the BS towards the test
range antenna as the standing waves go in and out of phase causing a
ripple in measured gain.

**B2-13 Switching uncertainty**

The purpose of the switching unit is to switch electromechanically
different RF path to different measurement instruments of different
measurement modes. The electromechanical switching clearly reduces the
errors arising from manual switching work. Switching is also used to
measure the path loss values of each polarization component. Even though
the electromechanical switching is preferable during path loss and
antenna performance measurements, some minor uncertainties can occur
when the switch states are programmed to change their polarity.

B.3 Near Field Test Range
=========================

This clause describes measurement uncertainty contributors for RX
measurements in Near Field Test Range.

**B3-1 Axes intersection**

This is a mechanical uncertainty term and aim to find the uncertainty
related with the lateral displacement between the horizontal and
vertical axes of the BS positioner. This can result in sampling the
field on a non-ideal sphere. This uncertainty is assumed to have a
Gaussian distribution.

**B3-2 Axes orthogonality**

The difference from 90 ° of the angle between the horizontal and
vertical axes also results in sampling the field on a non ideal sphere.
This uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.

**B3-3 Horizontal pointing**

The horizontal mispointing of the horizontal axis to the probe reference
point for Theta = 0 ° also results in sampling the field on a non-ideal
sphere. This uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.

**B3-4 Probe vertical position**

The vertical displacement of the probe reference point from the
horizontal axis results in sampling the field on a non ideal sphere.
This uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.

**B3-5 Probe horizontal/vertical pointing**

The horizontal or vertical mispointing of the probe z-axis from the
intersection point of the horizontal/vertical axis. This uncertainty is
assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.

**B3-6 Measurement distance**

This is the knowledge of the distance between the intersection point of
the horizontal and vertical axis and probe reference point. This
uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.

**B3-7 Amplitude and phase drift**

The system drift due to temperature variations causes the signal at BS
location to drift in amplitude and phase. This uncertainty is assumed to
have a Gaussian distribution.

**B3-8 Amplitude and phase noise**

This uncertainty is due to the noise level of the test range so that the
S/N ratio should be determined or measured at the BS location. The noise
level is usually measured with a spectrum analyzer. This uncertainty is
assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.

**B3-9 Leakage and crosstalk**

This uncertainty can be addressed by measurements on the actual system
setup. The leakage and crosstalk cannot be separated from the random
amplitude and phase errors so that the relative importance should be
determined. This uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.

**B3-10 Amplitude non-linearity**

This uncertainty is the linearity of the receiver used for the
measurement. It can be taken from the data sheet of the receiver.

**B3-11 Amplitude and phase shift in rotary joint**

This uncertainty is due to the variation of the rotary joint. It can be
measured and is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.

**B3-12 Channel balance amplitude and phase**

This uncertainty is relevant for systems which are using dual polarized
probes and polarization switches. The amplitude and phase difference
between two signal channels of the receiver includes the difference
between the probe ports, difference between the channels of the
polarization switch, connecting cables and reflection coefficients. This
uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.

**B3-13 Probe polarization amplitude and phase**

The amplitude and phase of the probe polarization coefficients should be
measured. This uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.

**B3-14 Probe pattern knowledge**

The probe(s) pattern(s) is assumed to be known so that the BS
measurement in near field can be corrected when performing the near
field to far field transform. There is no direct dependence between the
BS pattern and the probe pattern in near field measurements. This
uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.

**B3-15 Multiple reflections**

The multiple reflections occur when a portion of the transmitted signal
is reflected form the receiving antenna back to the transmitting antenna
and re-reflected by the transmitting antenna back to the receiving
antenna. This uncertainty can be determined by multiple measurements of
the BS when at different distance from the probes. This uncertainty is
assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.

**B3-16 Room scattering**

As for the multiple reflections, a portion of the transmitted signal is
reflected by either the absorbers or other structures in the measurement
anechoic chamber before being received by the receiving antenna. This
effect can be isolated from the multiple reflections by testing the BS
in different positions, separated by λ/4 with respect to the anechoic
chamber and comparing these measurements with the reference. This
uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.

**B3-17 BS support scattering**

This is the uncertainty due to the BS supporting structure on the signal
level. This uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.

**B3-18 Scan area truncation**

This uncertainty does affect the near field measurement. It can be
addressed by comparing the measurement result when scanning the full
area. This uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.

**B3-19 Sampling point offset**

This uncertainty has an influence in near field and far field. It is
assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.

**B3-20 Mode truncation**

The measured near field is expanded using a finite set of spherical
modes. The number of modes is linked to number of samples. The filtering
effect generated by the finite number of modes can improve measurement
results by removing signals from outside the physical area of the BS.
Care should be taken in order to make sure the removed signals are not
from the BS itself. This uncertainty is usually negligible.

**B3-21 Positioning**

The relative position of the probe array is not ideal. This uncertainty
is assumed to have a rectangular distribution.

**B3-22 Probe array uniformity**

This is the uncertainty due to the fact that different probes are used
for each physical position. Different probes have different *radiation
patterns*. This uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.

**B3-23 Mismatch of transmitter chain**

If the same chain configuration (including the vector signal generator;
the probe antenna and other elements) is used in both stages, the
uncertainty is considered systematic and constant 0.00 dB value.

If it is not the case, this uncertainty contribution has to be taken
into account and should be measured or determined by the method
described in TR 25.914 \[24\]. This uncertainty is assumed to have a
U-shaped distribution.

**B3-24 Insertion loss of transmitter chain**

It is composed of the following:

\- Insertion loss of the probe antenna cable.

\- Insertion loss of the probe antenna attenuator (if used).

\- Insertion loss of RF relays (if used).

If the same chain configuration is used for measurement and calibration,
the uncertainty due to the above components is considered systematic and
constant 0.00 dB value. This uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian
distribution.

**B3-25 Uncertainty of the absolute gain of the probe antenna**

This uncertainty appears in the both stages and it is thus considered
systematic and constant 0.00 dB value.

**B3-26 Measurement repeatability - positioning repeatability**

This uncertainty is due to the repositioning of the BS in the test
setup. It can be addressed by repeating the corresponding measurement 10
times. Calculate the standard deviation of the metric obtained and use
that as the measurement uncertainty. For tests that require multiple
setups, the worst-case standard deviation is used. This uncertainty is
assumed to have a Gaussian distribution.

**B3-27 Mismatch of transmitter chain**

If the same chain configuration (including the measurement receiver; the
probe antenna and other elements) is used in both stages, the
uncertainty is considered systematic and constant 0.00 dB value.

If it is not the case, this uncertainty contribution has to be taken
into account and should be measured or determined by the method
described in TR 25.914 \[24\]. This uncertainty is assumed to have a
Gaussian distribution.

**B3-28 Insertion loss of transmitter chain**

If the same chain configuration is used for measurement and calibration,
the uncertainty due to the above components is considered systematic and
constant 0.00 dB value. This uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian
distribution.

**B3-29 Mismatch in the connection of the calibration antenna**

This is the uncertainty from the mismatch in the connection between the
system coax cable and the calibration antenna. It should be measured or
determined by the method described in TR 25.914 \[24\]. This uncertainty
is assumed to have a U-shaped distribution.

**B3-30 Influence of the calibration antenna feed cable**

This uncertainty is due to the impact of the feeding cable on the
radiation properties of the calibration antenna. In case of using either
a standard horn or standard gain horn, the impact of the cable is to be
considered negligible thus the uncertainty 0.00 dB value. In case of
using a dipole-like antenna, the uncertainty should be addressed by
measuring this impact. This uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian
distribution.

**B3-31 Influence of the probe antenna cable**

If the same chain configuration is used for measurement and calibration,
the uncertainty due to the above components is considered systematic and
constant 0.00 dB value. This uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian
distribution.

**B3-32 Short term repeatability**

It can be addressed by performing a repeatability test of the
calibration antenna. This uncertainty is assumed to have a Gaussian
distribution.

B.4 One Dimensional Compact Range
=================================

This clause describes measurement uncertainty contributors for RX
measurements in One Dimensional Compact Range.

NOTE: Several MU contributor descriptions are defined in a way combining
both BS for the measurement stage and calibration/reference antenna for
calibration stage, e.g. for A1-4 this contribution is denoted as A1-4a
for polarization mismatch between the BS and the receiving antenna, and
as A1-4b for polarization mismatch between the reference antenna and the
receiving antenna.

**B4-1 Misalignment BS and pointing error**

This contribution denotes uncertainty in BS alignment and BS pointing
error. In this measurement the BS is aligned to maximum, also allowing
for a zero contribution for polarization mismatch uncertainty. By
adjusting for maximums to align, this contribution can be a small
contribution. The reference antenna´s phase centre and polarization
purity changes slightly according to the frequency. Therefore, there
should be some uncertainty reserved for this. To ensure that the
pointing error is at a minimal, this contribution should be captured
using the antenna pattern cut which is broadest (in the case of the BS
this would most likely be in the azimuth domain).

**B4-2 Standing wave between BS (a) /reference antenna (b) and test
range antenna**

This value is extracting the uncertainty value and standard deviation of
gain ripple coming from standing waves between BS/reference antenna and
test range antenna. This value can be captured by moving the BS (a)
/reference antenna (b) towards the test range antenna as the standing
waves go in and out of phase causing a ripple in measured gain.

**B4-3 Quiet zone ripple experienced by BS (a) /reference antenna (b)**

This is the quiet zone (QZ) ripple experienced by the BS (a) / reference
antenna (b) during the measurement phase. The purpose of this component
is to capture the contributions that the reflections from the walls,
roof and floor that will add to the EIS measurement. The sum of all
these reflections from the walls, roof and floor will give the overall
value for the QZ ripple. In other words, the uncertainty component from
the wall will not be separated from the roof or the floor. The purpose
of this uncertainty component is to capture the overall reflections from
the chamber walls experienced by the BS (a) / reference antenna (b). To
capture the full effect of the QZ ripple a distance of 1λ must be
measured from each of the BS (a) / reference antenna (b) physical
aperture edges, i.e. total QZ distance = physical aperture length + 2 λ,
to ensure the full volume of the QZ is captured in the uncertainty
measurement.

**B4-4 Phase curvature**

This contribution originates from the finite far-field measurement
distance, which causes phase curvature across the antenna of the
BS/reference antenna.

**B4-5 Polarization mismatch between BS (a) /reference antenna (b) and
transmitting antenna**

This contribution originates from the misaligned polarization between
the BS (a) /reference antenna (b) and the transmitting antenna.

**B4-6 Mutual coupling between BS (a) /reference antenna (b) and
transmitting antenna**

This contribution originates from mutual coupling between the BS (a)
/reference antenna (b) and the transmitting antenna. Mutual coupling
degrades not just the antenna efficiency, but it can alter the
antenna\'s *radiation pattern* as well. For compact range chamber,
usually the spacing between the transmitting antenna and the BS (a)
/reference antenna (b) is large enough so that the level of mutual
coupling might be negligible.

**B4-7 Impedance mismatch in transmitting chain**

This contribution originates from multiple reflections between the
transmitting antenna and the signal generator. The multiple reflections
can produce an overall reflection that depends not only upon the
individual reflections of each part but their reflective interactions as
well. The combination loss by the overall reflection can be higher or
lower than individual loss by multiple reflections. The combination loss
is called the mismatch error and leads to the measurement uncertainty.

**B4-8 RF leakage and dynamic range**

This contribute denotes noise leaking into connectors and cables between
test range antenna and receiving equipment.

**B4-9 Misalignment positioning system**

This contribution originates from uncertainty in sliding position and
turn table angle accuracy. If the reference antenna is aligned to the
maximum then this contribution can be considered negligible and
therefore set to zero.

**B4-10 Pointing error between reference antenna and test range
antenna**

This contribution originates from the misalignment of the testing
direction and the *beam peak direction* of the transmitting antenna due
to imperfect rotation operation. The pointing misalignment may happen in
both azimuth and vertical directions and the effect of the misalignment
depends highly on the beamwidth of the beam under test. The same level
of misalignment results in a larger measurement error for a narrower
beam.

**B4-11 Impedance mismatch in path to reference antenna**

This contribution originates from multiple reflections between the
reference antenna and the measurement equipment. After appropriate
calibration, the measurement equipment may not introduce impedance
mismatch error, but the error still happens between the reference
antenna feed cable and the reference antenna.

**B4-12 Impedance mismatch in path to compact probe**

This contribution originates from multiple reflections between the
transmitting antenna and the measurement equipment. After appropriate
calibration, the measurement equipment may not introduce impedance
mismatch error, but the error still happens between the transmitting
antenna feed cable and the transmitting antenna.

**B4-13 Influence of reference antenna feed cable (flexing cables,
adapters, attenuators and connector repeatability)**

During the calibration phase this cable is used to feed the reference
antenna and any influence it may have upon the measurements is captured.
This is assessed by repeated measurements while flexing the cables and
rotary joints. The largest difference between the results is recorded as
the uncertainty.

**B4-14 Mismatch of transmitter chain (i.e. between transmitting
measurement antenna and BS)**

This uncertainty is the residual uncertainty contribution coming from
multiple reflections between the transmitting antenna and the signal
generation equipment. This value can be captured through measurement by
measuring the S~11~ towards the transmit antenna and also towards the
test signal generator equipment. The mismatch between the antenna
reflection and the transmit reflection can also be calculated.

**B4-15 Insertion loss of transmitter chain**

This uncertainty is the residual uncertainty contribution coming from
introducing an antenna at the end of the cable. If this cable does not
change/move between the calibration and the BS measurement stage, the
uncertainty is assumed to be systematic. Alternatively, the insertion
loss can be calculated by taking the measurement of the cable where port
2 is the end of the cable connected to the measurement antenna.

IL = -20log~10~\|S~21~\| dB

**B4-16 RF leakage (SGH connector terminated and test range antenna
connector terminated)**

This contribution denotes noise leaking into connector and cable(s)
between test range antenna and receiving equipment. The contribution
also includes the noise leakage between the connector and cable(s)
between SGH/reference antenna and transmitting equipment.

B.5 Plane Wave Synthesizer
==========================

This clause describes measurement uncertainty contributors for RX
measurements in Plane Wave Synthesizer.

NOTE: Several MU contributor descriptions are defined in a way combining
both BS for the measurement stage and calibration/reference antenna for
calibration stage, e.g. for A1-4 this contribution is denoted as A1-4a
for polarization mismatch between the BS and the receiving antenna, and
as A1-4b for polarization mismatch between the reference antenna and the
receiving antenna.

**B5-1 Misalignment and pointing error of BS (a) /calibration antenna
(b)**

This contribution denotes uncertainty in BS/calibration antenna
alignment and BS/calibration antenna pointing error. In this measurement
the BS/calibration antenna is aligned to maximum, also allowing for a
zero contribution for polarization mismatch uncertainty. By adjusting
for maximums to align, this contribution can be a small contribution.
The calibration antenna\'s phase centre and polarization purity changes
slightly according to the frequency. Therefore, there should be some
uncertainty reserved for this. To ensure that the point error is at a
minimal, this contribution should be captured using the antenna pattern
cut which is broadest (in the case of the BS this would most likely be
in the azimuth domain).

**B5-2 Longitudinal position uncertainty (i.e. standing wave and
imperfect field synthesis) for BS antenna (a) / calibration antenna
(b)**

This value covers the effect of standing wave between BS or calibration
antenna and the test range antenna, but also counts for the PWS
imperfect field synthesis over distance. This value can be captured by
moving the BS or calibration antenna towards the test range antenna.

**B5-3 RF leakage (calibration antenna connector terminated)**

This contribution denotes noise leaking in to connector and cable(s)
between test range antenna and receiving equipment. The contribution
also includes the noise leakage between the connector and cable(s)
between reference antenna and transmitting equipment.

**B5-4** **QZ ripple experienced by BS (a) /calibration antenna (b)**

This is the quiet zone (QZ) ripple experienced by the BS/reference
antenna during the measurement phase. The purpose of this component is
to capture the contributions that the reflections from the walls, roof
and floor that will add to measurements. The sum of all these
reflections from the walls, roof and floor will give the overall value
for the QZ ripple. In other words, the uncertainty component from the
wall will not be separated from the roof or the floor. The purpose of
this uncertainty component is to capture the overall reflections from
the chamber walls experienced by the BS/reference antenna.

**B5-5 Miscellaneous uncertainty**

The term \'miscellaneous uncertainty\' is used to define all the
unknown, unquantifiable, etc. uncertainties associated with EIRP
measurements. This term should include truly random effects as well as
systematic uncertainties, such as that arising from dissimilarity
between the patterns of the reference antenna and the BS.

**B5-6 Mismatch (i.e. reference antenna, network analyser and reference
cable)**

This uncertainty is the residual uncertainty contribution coming from
multiple reflections between the receiving antenna and the test receiver
equipment. This value can be captured through measurement by measuring
the S~11~ towards the receive antenna and also towards the test
receiver. The mismatch between the antenna reflection and the receiver
reflection can also be calculated. If the same cable is used for
calibration Stage 1, this can be considered systematic and negligible.

**B5-7 Insertion loss of transmit chain**

This uncertainty is the residual uncertainty contribution coming from
introducing an antenna at the end of the cable. If this cable does not
change/move between the calibration Stage 1 and the measurement Stage 2,
the uncertainty is assumed to be systematic and negligible during the
measurement stage. Alternatively, the insertion loss can also be
calculated by taking the measurement of the cable where port 2 is the
end of the cable connected to the BS or calibration antenna.

IL = -20log~10~\|S~21~\| dB

**B5-8 Influence of the calibration antenna feed cable (i.e. flexing
cables, adapters, attenuators, extra pathloss cable & connector
repeatability)**

During the calibration phase this cable is used to feed the calibration
antenna and any influence it may have upon the measurements is captured.
This is assessed by repeated measurements while flexing the cables and
rotary joints. The largest difference between the results is recorded as
the uncertainty.

**B5-9 Misalignment of positioning system**

This contribution originates from uncertainty in sliding position and
turn table angle accuracy. If the calibration antenna is aligned to
maximum this contribution can be considered negligible and therefore set
to zero.

**B5-10 Rotary joints**

If applicable, this uncertainty term corresponds to the accuracy in
changing from azimuth to vertical measurements.

**B5-11 Switching uncertainty**

The purpose of the switching unit is to switch electromechanically
different RF path to different measurement instruments of different
measurement modes. The electromechanical switching clearly reduces the
errors arising from manual switching work. Switching is also used to
measure the path loss values of each polarization component. Even though
the electromechanical switching is preferable during path loss and
antenna performance measurements, some minor uncertainties can occur
when the switch states are programmed to change their polarity.

**B5-12 Field repeatability**

Each execution of field calibration of the measurement *antenna array*
to find the PWS settings provides a slightly different set of settings
for the RF components for each antenna path. This results in variation
of the synthesized plane wave in the QZ and variation of PWS antenna to
reference antenna coupling. This variation is described by field
repeatability term.

**B5-13 Frequency flatness of test system**

This uncertainty contribution to account for the frequency interpolation
error caused by a finite frequency resolution during the calibration
stage.

**B5-14 System non-linearity**

This uncertainty term is calculated as RSS of the following items,
assuming a rectangular distribution:

\- System non-linearity in time. This is assessed by repeated
measurements over a period of time (e.g. 60 minutes) for the same
reference power transmitted by the reference antenna. The largest
difference between the results is recorded as the uncertainty.

\- System non-linearity in power. This is assessed by repeated
measurements over a range of transmitted powers. The largest delta
between the increments on the receiving side versus the transmitting
side is recorded as the uncertainty.

######## Annex C (informative): Test equipment uncertainty values

C.1 Test equipment measurement error contribution descriptions
==============================================================

**C1-1 Uncertainty of the RF power measurement equipment (e.g. spectrum
analyzer, power meter)**

The receiving device used to measure the received signal level in the
EIRP tests either as an absolute level or as a relative level. These
receiving devices to name a few are spectrum analyzers, network
analyzers or power meter. These devices will have an uncertainty
contribution of their own; this value declared by the test gear vendor
should be recorded as this uncertainty contribution. If a power meter is
used then both measurement uncertainty and out of band noise is
considered as part of the contribution. This uncertainty value can be
found in table C2-1 and was a result of compromised value in order to
align all test methods having this uncertainty contribution.

**C1-2 Uncertainty of the RF signal generator**

The use of this signal generator introduces an uncertainty on the
absolute output level. The uncertainty value will be indicated in the
manufacturer\'s data sheet in logs. This uncertainty value can be found
in Annex C2-1 and was a result of compromised value in order to align
all test methods having this uncertainty contribution.

measurements**

This uncertainty includes all the uncertainties involved in the S~21~
measurement (including drift and frequency flatness) with a network
analyzer, and will be calculated from the manufacturer\'s data in logs.
This uncertainty also includes analyzer uncertainty for
multi-polarization (2 or more ports) measured simultaneously. This
uncertainty value can be found in table C2-1 and was a result of
compromised value in order to align all test methods having this
uncertainty contribution.

**C1-4 Uncertainty of the absolute gain of the reference antenna**

This uncertainty consists of the uncertainty of the gain value
associated with the gain value denoted from the antenna calibration.
This uncertainty value can be found in table C.2-1 and was a result of
compromised value in order to align all test methods having this
uncertainty contribution.

band time domain high dynamic range signals required for the Tx OFF
transient test.

C.2 Measurement Equipment uncertainty values

The following uncertainty distribution and standard uncertainty (σ)
values proposed by test vendors are adopted for the RF power measurement
equipment, RF signal generator, and network analyzer to calculate the
uncertainty budget.

######## Annex D (informative): Beam sweeping

D.1 Introduction
================

For emissions with a high beam-forming gain, correct assessment of TRP
requires grid measurements at small angular steps. In a measurement
where the BS is mounted on a turntable this turns into a large number of
mechanical rotations of the BS and hence lengthy measurements. One way
to mitigate this problem is to use *beam sweeping* as a complement to
mechanical rotations. Instead of performing the TRP measurements using a
fixed beam, the BS will be programmed to move the beam across several
pre-defined positions, while the power samples are recorded for each
point on the grid.

Such method could be advantageous not only for in-band signals, but also
for spurious emissions characterized by high beamforming gain, such as
harmonics.

The results below show that the calculated TRP from the beam average
pattern is very close to the TRP of all individual beams that are
included in the sweeping. The advantage of this method would be the
possibility to use sparser spherical grid compared to reference angular
steps, and without the need to find the peaks of the emissions.

D.2 Simulation results
======================

The effect of beam sweeping is illustrated by using a 10x10 Uniform
Rectangular Array with $0.55\lambda$ element separation at the carrier
frequency. A number of beams is realized by a constant phase-gradient
steering. The beam sweeping range is selected to completely avoid the
forming of grating lobes and the angular step between two lobes is
selected as the Half Power Beamwidth (HPBW) of a broadside beam.

In the example of figure D.2-1 the reference angular step is 11.6 °
($D = 5\lambda = > \Delta\phi_{\text{ref}} = \lambda/D$=1/5 radians).
For the harmonic in figure D.2-2 the reference step is 5.8 °. The full
sphere average of the EIRP is the TRP. For simplicity, only sweeping in
the horizontal plane is employed. In the case where a fixed beam is used
the average EIRP is not correct when the sampling angular step is larger
than the reference angular step $\Delta\phi_{\text{ref}}$. However, when
the EIRP pattern is first averaged over all beams (blue curves) the
average EIRP is virtually constant for any angular step up to 36 °, see
figure D.2-3.

Figure D.2-1: In the left figure several beam patterns of the array are
depicted, together with the corresponding element pattern. In the right
picture two different settings of a spectrum analyser are simulated.
Under the \"Max hold\" setting of the analyser the maximum EIRP over all
beams is presented at every angular point. Under the \"Average\" setting
the average EIRP over all beams is presented. The latter case is the
intended setting to use for TRP assessment

Figure D.2-3: Calculation of average EIRP in the azimuth cut by using
different angular step sizes. The yellow curve corresponds to a fixed
broadside beam (perpendicular to the *antenna array* surface), and all
the green curves correspond to steered, but fixed beams. The variation
in TRP for different beams at the harmonic is due to grating lobe
effects

D.3 Measurement results
=======================

The effect of beam sweeping measured on an BS employing a 4x16 array, is
depicted in figures D.3-2 and D.3-3. Measurements were performed in a
CATR, in far-field conditions, with an BS that transmits one single beam
that can be moved across a number of pre-defined directions. For the
results using beam sweeping, see right figure in figure D.3-2, the
following beam settings were used:

\- 48 pre-defined beam directions (see fig. D.3-1) were swept, changing
the beam direction every 15 us

\- the range of beam directions is ± 60 and ± 15 ° in azimuth and
elevation, respectively.

\- The BS is making a full rotation (i.e. 360 °) mechanically into the
horizontal plane, with a step of 1 °. Each position was held for about 1
s, while the spectrum analyser recorded a time averaged value of the
received power (at least 1000 samples for each angular position were
considered enough for good statistical average).

Figure D.3-1: Pre-defined possible directions of the main beam (red
spots). Compared to the broadside beam (the middle one) the maximum
supported steering is ± 60 ° in azimuth and ± 15 ° in elevation. The
extreme directions are excluded in this experiment, so only 48
directions are swept

at a single frequency. A significantly broader pattern is detected for
the beam sweeping signal (spectrum analyser in \"Average\" mode). To the
right the angular average of the EIRP values are depicted for different
angular step sizes

D.4 Design of beam sweeping test signal
=======================================

The following design criteria have been identified:

1\. Full transmit power is used for all beams.

2\. Horizontal beam separation shall be the HPBW in the azimuth
direction and the vertical beam separation shall be the HPBW in the
vertical direction, evaluated for a broadside beam.

3\. Lobes with high loss compared to the broadside beam are avoided. By
loss we mean the reduction in beamforming gain between different
positions of the beam).

The motivation for the third criterion is to have a fairly constant TRP
for the used beams. The loss can be due to both loss in element pattern
gain, but also due to adverse mutual coupling effects. Removing lobes
with high loss gives a beam average TRP that is close to the TRP for any
individual beam.

######## Annex E (informative): Sparse sampling for spurious emissions

In the case of spurious emissions for large BSs, such as the BS, the
emissions do not necessarily radiate through the antenna elements. For
this reason, to be on the conservative side, the entire BS dimensions
should be considered when calculating the reference angular steps on the
spherical grid.

The emission lobes will be narrow and hard to locate for some emissions,
especially in the higher part of the spurious emissions domain. Instead
of searching for the direction of the emission lobes, it is proposed to
perform the measurement on a grid without alignment considerations and
add a correction factor to the TRP obtained from the grid, to ensure
overestimation. This correction factor is obtained through the study of
random rotations of the BS.

In practice, the emissions are likely to have a low degree of
correlation, except for harmonic emissions. For harmonic emissions a
beam sweeping test signal is proposed in annex D and the description of
such signal is not covered by the present release of this technical
report.

For non-harmonic emissions, a correlation factor distributed uniformly
in a given interval from 0 to
![](media/image154.png){width="0.2777777777777778in"
height="9.027777777777778e-2in"} is assumed when calculating the
correction factor ΔTRP for the TRP~Estimate~. The angular variation of
the emissions coming from low correlated sources is dominated by the
*array factor*, i.e., the spatial distribution of the sources. Hence,
emissions can be modelled by the *array factor* of a set of point
sources, i.e., for simplicity the element pattern is isotropic. To
quantify the degree of sparse sampling relative to the reference angular
steps a Sparsity Factor (SF) is introduced. For a spherical equal angles
grid

Where

height="0.4166666666666667in"}

The TRP~Estimate~ values are then calculated by using a given angular
grid defined by $\Delta\phi$and $\Delta\theta$ which are larger than the
reference angular steps $\Delta\phi_{\text{ref}}$ and
$\Delta\theta_{\text{ref}}$. The CDF of these TRP values are then
created and the CDF is shifted so that the 5th percentile corresponds to
0 dB TRP error. This shift is introduced as ΔTRP, see figure E-1.

In the followings we propose a method to estimate ΔTRP for large
antennas (D \> 4λ), based on generating a set of statistical samples of
TRP values calculated on a set of randomly generated emission sources of
a given size *D*.

In this investigation each statistical sample is generated as follows:

1\. Set up a quadratic uniform linear NxN array in the yz-plane, with
horizontal and vertical element separation

N is randomly chosen such that the element separation is larger or equal
to a half wave length.

2\. Rotate the source points by an Euler zyz-rotation with angles a, b,
and c which are uniformly chosen in the intervals \[0,360\], \[0,90\]
and \[0,360\] degrees, respectively. The rotated position of source *n*
is denoted ![](media/image157.png){width="0.13194444444444445in"
height="0.1527777777777778in"}

3\. Pick a random correlation value ρ from the uniform distribution
between 0 and ![](media/image154.png){width="0.2777777777777778in"
height="9.027777777777778e-2in"}, and generate source weights as

![](media/image158.png){width="2.0in" height="0.3333333333333333in"}

Where ![](media/image159.png){width="0.9583333333333334in"
height="0.13194444444444445in"} are picked from a normal distribution
with zero mean and unit standard deviation.

4\. Normalize the weights to TRP = 1 by using a full sphere grid with
sparsity factor 0.25.

5\. Generate EIRP values on the desired grid by using an *array factor*

![](media/image160.png){width="2.0069444444444446in"
height="0.4652777777777778in"}

6\. Calculate the TRP value as an appropriate mean value of the EIRP
values for two/three cut grids and using full sphere numerical
integration for the full sphere case.

There is publicly available Matlab code for sparse sampling analysis
in \[22\] and more results can be found in publication in \[10\].

The resulting 5^th^ percentile values of the empirical CDFs are used as
a practical lower bound on the TRP calculated directly from the points
in the actual grid. If the 5^th^ percentile value is positive, there is
no need for a systematic correction, that means ΔTRP = 0. On the other
hand, if the 5^th^ percentile value is negative, a systematic correction
is needed to guarantee TRP overestimation with 95% confidence. For this
purpose, the absolute value of the 5^th^ percentile is used as
systematic correction factor, denoted ΔTRP (see figure E-1). Some
simulation results are found in figures E-2 (a) -- (c) for two different
choices of max correlation and the three grid types: full-sphere,
three-cut, and two-cuts.

The following systematic correction factors are proposed be used in the
test procedure, given the results obtained for
$\rho_{\text{max\ }} = 0.5$, which is considered to be acceptable at
this point.

######## Annex F (informative): Power density measurements close to BS

This annex contains guidelines for measurement of power density flux on
a sphere surrounding the BS. The rationale for using a small test
distance (compared to the far-field of BS) is that any amount of power
that radiates from the BS also will radiate through any sphere enclosing
the BS, i.e., energy conservation.

Power flux density based on measurement of tangential electric field
components can be used for correct TRP assessment \[31\]. For accurate
power density assessment, the following conditions need to be met:

1\. The test distance shall be at least the far-field distance of the
measurement antenna, i.e.

2\. The measurement antenna shall sample an approximately constant
field.

3\. The test distance must be at least two wavelengths from the smallest
sphere enclosing the BS.

The second criterion is quantified as:

, (F-1)

where R~sph~ is the radius of the smallest sphere enclosing the BS.
Furthermore, equstion (F-1) sets a minimum test distance for a given
measurement antenna size *w \[31\]*.

Figure F-1: The measurement distance and the dimensions of BS and MA

EXAMPLE: For assessing TRP using power density data close to BS,
consider the patterns in Figure G-2, which are sampled at (a) 0.75 m,
(b) 2.5 m and (c) 30 m from the same BS. The far-field distance of the
BS is 30 m. The angular patterns vary with distance, but the full-sphere
integration for TRP deviates less than 0.065 dB. The lower power density
levels in the lower figure are balanced by the larger total area of the
measurement sphere.
