 Foreword
========

This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:

**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something

**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something

The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the
context of normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.

The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes
for \"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as
possible, and they are not used in a normative context except in a
direct citation from an external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so
as to maintain continuity of style when extending or modifying the
provisions of such a referenced document.

**should** indicates a recommendation to do something

**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something

**may** indicates permission to do something

**need not** indicates permission not to do something

The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\"
are used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.

**can** indicates that something is possible

**cannot** indicates that something is impossible

The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\"
and \"need not\".

**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a
result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to
happen as a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which
is outside the scope of the present document

**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result
of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document

**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

In addition:

**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement
of fact

**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates
a statement of fact

The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

 1 Scope
=======

The present document establishes 2 sets of minimum requirements and
minimum performance requirements; *hybrid requirements set* which
specify requirements for a *hybrid AAS BS* with both a conducted and a
radiated interface and *OTA requirements set* which specify requirements
for an *OTA AAS BS* which has a radiated interface only.

The *hybrid AAS BS* requirements are specified for E-UTRA AAS Base
Station (BS), the FDD mode of UTRA AAS Base Station (BS), the 1,28 Mcps
TDD mode of UTRA AAS Base Station (BS) in single RAT and any MSR AAS
Base Station (BS) implementation of these RATs (including NR BS type 1-H
MSR configurations).

The *OTA AAS BS* requirements are specified for E-UTRA AAS Base Station
(BS), the FDD mode of UTRA AAS Base Station (BS), in single RAT and any
MSR AAS Base Station (BS) implementation of these RATs (including NR BS
type 1-O MSR configurations).

NOTE 1: The present document does not establish minimum RF
characteristics or minimum performance requirements for Narrow-Band
Internet of Things (NB-IoT) in band, NB-IoT guard band, or standalone
NB-IoT operation, for AAS BS in *single RAT E-UTRA operation* or in *MSR
operation* using E-UTRA.

NOTE 2: The present document does not establish minimum RF
characteristics for MBMS for AAS BS in *single RAT E-UTRA operation*.

=========

4.1 Relationship between the AAS BS specification and non‑AAS BS single RAT & MSR specifications
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An AAS BS is distinguished from a *non-AAS BS* by including a dedicated
antenna system in its design.

The transceiver to antenna RF interface of the AAS BS (referred to as
the *transceiver array boundary*) comprises one or several *TAB
connectors*. There is no general one-to-one relationship between
*non-AAS BS* antenna connectors and AAS BS *TAB connectors*, but it can
be expected the number of *TAB connectors* in AAS BS will be greater
than or equal to the number of *non-AAS BS* antenna connectors for
respective base stations with corresponding functionality.

For the conducted requirements, the AAS BS requirements are formulated
in such a way that the impact of what they are meant to regulate is
expected to be \"equivalent\" to the corresponding *non-AAS BS*
requirements; i.e. the outside world sees the same level of emissions,
power levels, or can expect the same demodulation performance at the UE
from the AAS BS as it would from a *non-AAS BS* with equivalent
functionality. All *non-AAS BS* RF requirements (referenced to the
*non-AAS BS* antenna connector) have been adapted to AAS BS conducted
requirements. Many requirements are also direct references to the
*non-AAS* BS RF specifications 3GPP TS 25.104 \[2\], 3GPP TS 25.105
\[3\], 3GPP TS 36.104 \[4\] and 3GPP TS 37.104 \[5\].

NOTE 1: Applying *non-AAS BS* antenna connector requirements directly to
individual *TAB connectors* renders certain AAS BS requirements
excessively strict from a system perspective.

NOTE 2: Both specific references and non-specific references occur.

In addition, some new OTA requirements are introduced. These
requirements have no corresponding *non-AAS BS* requirements.

For a *OTA AAS BS* there are no conducted requirements. The radiated
requirements have been derived based on the principle that they offer
the same level of performance and protection as the *hybrid AAS BS*
requirements. The radiated requirements therefore use the same
equivalence to the non-AAS requirements. The *non-AAS BS* RF
requirements have therefore been further adapted to apply to OTA metrics
in the far field. Some requirements are direct references to the
*non-AAS BS* RF specifications 3GPP TS 25.104 \[2\], 3GPP TS 25.105
\[3\], 3GPP TS 36.104 \[4\] and 3GPP TS 37.104 \[5\]. Some co-location
requirements which have been developed from assumptions on BS-to-BS
coupling do not have direct OTA equivalents. The radiated co-location
requirements use the same scenarios used to develop the *non-AAS* RF
requirements.

In this specification, the term \"requirements for *single RAT
operation*\" refers to requirements that are derived from the 3GPP TS
25.104 \[2\], 3GPP TS 25.105 \[3\], or 3GPP TS 36.104 \[4\]
specifications baseline, whilst \"requirements for *MSR operation*\"
refers to requirements derived from the 3GPP TS 37.104 \[5\]
specification baseline (including NR operation as part of MSR).

NB-IoT in-band, NB-IoT guard band, or standalone NB-IoT operation is not
supported by AAS BS. When referring to standalone E-UTRA requirements
for *single RAT operation* in 3GPP TS 36.104 \[4\] or to E-UTRA
requirements for *MSR operation* in 3GPP TS 37.104 \[5\], any
requirements specified in those specifications for E-UTRA with NB-IoT
(in-band or guard band) or for standalone NB-IoT, shall not be
considered for the AAS BS. Unless otherwise stated, the exclusion of the
NB-IoT requirements in this specification applies to all operation modes
(i.e. *in-band NB-IoT operation*, *guard band NB-IoT operation* and
*standalone NB-IoT operation*).NR requirements for *single RAT*
operation are not specified in the present document because AAS RF
requirements for single RAT NR are fully captured in the NR
specification 38.104 \[27\].

Band 46 operation and Band 49 operation is not supported by AAS BS. When
referring to standalone E-UTRA requirements for *single RAT operation*
in 3GPP TS 36.104 \[4\] or to E-UTRA requirements for *MSR operation* in
3GPP TS 37.104 \[5\], any requiremetns specified in those specifications
for Band 46 or Band 49 operation shall not be considered for the AAS BS
with E‑UTRA.

4.2 Relationship between minimum requirements and test requirements
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Conformance to the present specification is demonstrated by fulfilling
the test requirements specified in the conformance specifications TS
37.145-1 \[29\] and TS 37.145-2 \[30\].

The minimum requirements given in this specification make no allowance
for measurement uncertainty. The test specifications TS 37.145-1 \[29\]
and TS 37.145-2 \[30\] define test tolerances. These test tolerances are
individually calculated for each test. The test tolerances are used to
relax the minimum requirements in this specification to create test
requirements. For some requirements, including regulatory requirements,
the test tolerance is set to zero.

The measurement results returned by the test system are compared -
without any modification - against the test requirements as defined by
the shared risk principle. The shared risk principle is defined in
Recommendation ITU‑R M.1545 \[11\].

4.3 Conducted and radiated requirement reference points
-------------------------------------------------------

AAS BS requirements are defined for two points of reference, signified
by radiated requirements and conducted requirements.

![](media/image3.emf){width="6.71875in" height="2.7291666666666665in"}

Figure 4.3-1: Radiated and conducted points of reference of *hybrid AAS
BS*

![](media/image4.emf){width="5.802083333333333in"
height="2.5729166666666665in"}

Figure 4.3-2: Radiated points of reference of *OTA AAS BS*

Radiated characteristics are defined over the air (OTA) at the *radiated
interface boundary* (RIB). Radiated requirements are also referred to as
OTA requirements. The (spatial) directions in which the OTA requirements
apply are detailed for each requirement.

Some OTA requirements are specified as co-location requirements where
the requirements are specified at the conducted interface of the
*co-location reference antenna*, co-location requirements are further
defined in subclause 4.10.

Conducted characteristics are defined at individual or groups of *TAB
connectors* at the *transceiver array boundary*, which is the conducted
interface between the transceiver unit array and the composite antenna.

The transceiver unit array is part of the composite transceiver
functionality generating modulated transmit signal structures and
performing receiver combining and demodulation.

The transceiver unit array contains an implementation specific number of
transmitter units and an implementation specific number of receiver
units. Transmitter units and receiver units may be combined into
transceiver units. The transmitter/receiver units have the ability to
transmit/receive parallel independent modulated symbol streams.

The composite antenna contains a *radio distribution network* (RDN) and
an antenna array. The RDN is a linear passive network which distributes
the RF power generated by the transceiver unit array to the antenna
array, and/or distributes the radio signals collected by the antenna
array to the transceiver unit array, in an implementation specific way.

How a conducted requirement is applied to the *transceiver array
boundary* is detailed in the respective requirement subclause.

4.4 Base station classes for AAS BS
-----------------------------------

The requirements in the present document apply to AAS BS of Wide Area
BS, Medium Range BS and Local Area BS classes unless otherwise stated.
The associated deployment scenarios and definitions of BS classes are
exactly the same for AAS BS with and without connectors.

BS classes for *OTA AAS BS* are defined as indicated below:

\- Wide Area Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived
from Macro Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum distance along the
ground equal to 35 m.

\- Medium Range Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived
from Micro Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum distance along the
ground equal to 5 m.

\- Local Area Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived
from Pico Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum distance along the
ground equal to 2 m.

BS classes for *hybrid AAS BS* are defined as indicated below:

\- Wide Area BS are characterized by requirements derived from Macro
Cell scenarios. For *AAS BS* of Wide Area BS class, the minimum coupling
loss between any *TAB connector* and the UE is 70 dB.

\- Medium Range BS are characterized by requirements derived from Micro
Cell scenarios. For *AAS BS* of Medium Range BS class, the minimum
coupling loss between any *TAB connector* and the UE is 53 dB.

\- Local Area BS are characterized by requirements derived from Pico
Cell scenarios. For AAS *BS* of Local Area BS class, the minimum
coupling loss between any *TAB connector* and the UE is 45 dB.

> NOTE: Whenever WA BS is referred in this specification, the NB-IoT
> Wide Area BS and related requirements as defined in 3GPP TS 36.104
> \[4\], are not applicable for *OTA AAS BS*, nor for *hybrid AAS BS*.

4.5 Regional requirements
-------------------------

Some requirements in the present document may only apply in certain
regions either as optional requirements, or as mandatory requirements
set by local and regional regulation. It is normally not stated in the
3GPP specifications under what exact circumstances the regional
requirements apply, since this is defined by local or regional
regulation.

Table 4.5-1 lists all requirements in the present specification that may
be applied differently in different regions. *Non‑AAS BS* requirements
are applicable as defined in the present document. In many cases, such
requirements include regional requirements that are implicitly
referenced from the present specification, and listed in the
specification for the specifications concerned 3GPP TS 25.104 \[2\],
3GPP TS 25.105 \[3\], 3GPP TS 36.104 \[4\] and 3GPP TS 37.104 \[5\].

4.6 Operating Bands and Band Categories
---------------------------------------

The operating bands and *band categories* for AAS BS are the same as for
*non-AAS BS*, as described in 3GPP TS 37.104 \[5\].

NOTE 1: AAS BS does not support GSM, but BC2 is still applicable for
protection of and against GSM operation in BC2 operating bands.

NOTE 2: AAS BS does not support Band 46 (and all its sub-bands defined
in 3GPP TS 36.104 \[8\], subclause 5.5) operation nor Band 49 operation,
but Band 46 or Band 49 requirements are still applicable for AAS BS for
protection of and against Band 46 or Band 49 operation.

4.7 Channel arrangements
------------------------

The channel arrangements for AAS BS are the same as those for UTRA
*non-AAS BS,* E-UTRA *non-AAS BS* and NR *non-AAS BS* as described in
3GPP TS 37.104 \[5\].

NOTE: Requirements for nominal carrier spacing of 19.8 MHz and 20.1 MHz
for carriers in Band 46 as specified in 36.104 \[8\] subclause 5.7.1,
are not applicable for AAS BS.

4.8 Requirements for contiguous and non-contiguous spectrum
-----------------------------------------------------------

A spectrum allocation where an AAS BS operates can be either contiguous
or non-contiguous. Unless otherwise stated, the requirements in the
present specification apply for AAS BS configured for both *contiguous
spectrum* operation and *non-contiguous spectrum* operation.

For AAS BS operation in *non-contiguous spectrum*, some requirements
apply both at the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edges* and inside the
*sub-block gaps*. For each such requirement, it is stated how the limits
apply relative to the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edges* and the
*sub-block* edges respectively.

4.9 Requirements for AAS BS capable of operation in multiple operating bands
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

For AAS BS capable of operation in multiple operating bands, the RF
requirements in clause 6, 7, 9, and 10 apply separately to each
supported operating band unless otherwise stated.

A *hybrid AAS BS* may be capable of supporting operation in multiple
operating bands with one of the following implementations of *TAB
connectors* in the *transceiver array boundary*:

\- All *TAB connectors* are *single band TAB connectors*.

\- Different sets of *single band TAB connectors* support different
operating bands, but each *TAB connector* supports only operation in one
single operating band.

\- Sets of *single band TAB connectors* support operation in multiple
operating bands with some *single band TAB connectors* supporting more
than one operating band.

\- All *TAB connectors* are multiband *TAB connectors*.

\- A combination of single band sets and multi-band sets of *TAB
connectors* provides support of the *hybrid AAS BS* capability of
operation in multiple operating bands.

Unless otherwise stated all requirements specified for an operating band
apply only to the set of *TAB connectors* supporting that operating
band.

In certain requirements it is explicitly stated that specific additions
or exclusions to the requirement apply at *multi-band TAB connectors* as
detailed in the requirement subclause. When referencing the NR
specification 3GPP TS 38.104 \[27\] for a BS type 1-H the multi-band
connector term is equivalent to a *multi-band TAB connector* in this
specification.

In the case of an operating band being supported only by *single band
TAB connectors* in a *TAB connector TX min cell group* or a *TAB
connector RX min cell group*, *single band requirements* apply to that
set of *TAB connectors*.

NOTE: Each supported operating band needs to be operated separately
during conformance testing on *single band TAB connectors*.

For a band supported by a *TAB connector* where the transmitted carriers
are not processed in active RF components together with carriers in any
other band, TX *single band requirements* shall apply. For a band
supported by a *TAB connector* where the received carriers are not
processed in active RF components together with carriers in any other
band, RX *single band requirements* shall apply.

In the case of an operating band being supported only by *multi-band TAB
connector*s supporting the same operating band combination in a *TAB
connector TX min cell group* or a *TAB connector RX min cell group*,
*multi-band requirements* apply to that set of *TAB connectors*.

The case of an operating band being supported by both *multi-band TAB
connectors* and *single band TAB connectors* in a *TAB connector TX min
cell group* or a *TAB connector RX min cell group* is not covered by the
present release of this specification.

The case of an operating band being supported by *multi-band TAB
connectors* which are not all supporting the same operating band
combination in a *TAB connector TX min cell group* or a *TAB connector
RX min cell group* is not covered by the present release of this
specification.

An *OTA AAS BS* may be capable of supporting operation in multiple
operating bands with one of the following implementations at the
*radiated interface boundary*:

\- All RIBs are *single band RIBs*.

\- All RIBs are *multiband RIBs*.

\- A combination of *single band RIBs* and *multi-band RIBs* provides
support of the *OTA AAS BS* capability of operation in multiple
operating bands.

In certain requirements it is explicitly stated that specific additions
or exclusions to the requirement apply at *multi-band RIBs* as detailed
in the requirement subclause.

NOTE: Each supported operating band needs to be operated separately
during conformance testing for single RIBs.

For *multi-band TAB connectors* and *multi-band RIBs* supporting the
bands for TDD, the RF requirements in the present specification assume
no simultaneous uplink and downlink occur between the bands.

The RF requirements for *multi-band TAB connectors* and *multi-band
RIBs* supporting bands for both FDD and TDD are not covered by the
present release of this specification.

A RIB may operate multi-RAT where the individual RATs are operated in
different RAT specific bands that partially or fully overlap; Δf~OBUE~
and Δf~OOB~ are according to the combined frequency range occupied by
the overlapping bands.

4.10 OTA Co-location with other base stations
---------------------------------------------

Co-location requirements are requirements which are based on assuming
the AAS BS is co-located with another BS of the same base station class,
they ensure that both co-located systems can operate with minimal
degradation to each other.

Unwanted emissions and out-of-band blocking co-location requirements are
optional requirements based on declaration. TX OFF and TX IMD are
mandatory requirements and have the form of a co-location requirement as
it represents the worst-case scenario of all the interference cases.

NOTE: Due to the low level of the unwanted emissions for the spurious
emissions and TX OFF level, co-location is the most suitable method to
show conformance.

The *co-location reference antenna*, shall be a single column passive
antenna which has the same vertical radiating dimension (h), frequency
range, polarization, as the composite antenna of AAS BS and nominal 65°
horizontal half-power beamwidth (suitable for 3-sector deployments) and
is placed at a distance *d* from the edge of the AAS BS, as shown in
Figure 4.10-1.

height="3.6666666666666665in"}

Figure 4.10-1 Illustration of AAS BS enclosure and *co-location
reference antenna*

Edge-to-edge separation d, between the AAS BS and the *co-location
reference antenna* shall be set to 0.1 m.

The AAS BS and the *co-location reference antenna* shall be aligned in a
common plane perpendicular to the mechanical bore-sight direction, as
shown in figure 4.10-1.

The *co-location reference antenna* and the AAS can have different
width.

The vertical radiating regions of the *co-location reference antenna*
and the AAS composite antenna shall be aligned.

For co-location requirements where the frequency range of the signal at
the *co-location reference antenna* is different from the AAS BS, a
*co-location reference antenna* suitable for the frequency stated in the
requirement is assumed.

OTA co-location requirements are based on the power at the conducted
interface of a *co-location reference antenna*, depending on the
requirement this interface is either an input or an output.

For AAS BS with dual polarization the *co-location reference antenna*
has two conducted interfaces each representing one polarization.

5 Applicability of Requirements
===============================

5.1 General
-----------

The applicability of requirements is related to the band categories
described in 3GPP TS 37.104 \[5\]. This clause captures the requirement
clauses\' applicability for the respective band categories depending on
the operating band specific BS RAT/MSR capability. For each individual
band, the manufacturer declares whether the AAS BS conforms to MSR or
single RAT requirements.

The applicability of requirements is further related to the declared AAS
BS architecture, either a *hybrid AAS BS* or a *OTA AAS BS*. This clause
captures the requirement clauses applicability to either the *hybrid AAS
BS requirement set* or the *OTA AAS BS requirement set*. The
manufacturer declares whether the AAS BS conforms to the *hybrid AAS BS
requirement set* or the *OTA AAS BS requirement set*.

In the present specification, requirements for *MSR operation* and for
*single RAT operation* are defined. If the AAS BS is declared to be
single RAT in an operating band, the respective requirements for *single
RAT operation* (derived from 3GPP TS 25.104 \[2\], 3GPP TS 25.105 \[3\]
or 3GPP TS 36.104 \[4\]) apply in that operating band. If the AAS BS is
declared to be MSR (operating one or more RATs) in the operating band,
the requirements for *MSR operation* (derived from 3GPP TS 35.104 \[5\])
apply to that operating band. Where requirements for *MSR operation*
comprise RAT specific requirements, these apply only when the AAS BS is
operating the RAT in the operating band.

NOTE: An AAS BS declared MSR in an operating band and operating only one
RAT is differentiated from an AAS BS declared single RAT in the
operating band by the fact that requirements are derived from 3GPP TS
37.104 \[5\] rather than from the single RAT specifications 3GPP TS
25.104 \[2\], 3GPP TS 25.105 \[3\] or 3GPP TS 36.104 \[4\].

5.2 Band category 1 (BC1) and band category 2 (BC2)
---------------------------------------------------

The RF requirements listed in table 5.2-1 apply to AAS BS for each
supported operating band belonging to BC1 and BC2. Requirements apply
according to the RAT/MSR capability of the AAS BS in the operating band,
as listed in the heading of the table and the declared requirement set
(hybrid or OTA). Some requirements listed in the table may not be
mandatory or they may apply only regionally. This is further specified
in the subclause treating each requirement and in table 4.5-1.

NOTE: Bands in BC1 and BC2 categories are also used for NB-IoT
operation. NB-IoT is not applicable for AAS BS.

For operation in multiple operating bands, the applicability of the
requirements in table 5.2-1 is determined based on the manufacturer
declared AAS BS RAT and single RAT/MSR conformance for each operating
band. The applicability of *multi-band requirements* respective *single
band requirements* is defined in clause 4.9 and in each referred clause
in the table but it cannot be determined by the table itself.

5.3 Band category 3 (BC3)
-------------------------

The RF requirements listed in table 5.3-1 apply to AAS BS for each
supported operating band belonging to BC3. Requirements apply according
to the RAT/MSR capability of the AAS BS in the operating band, as listed
in the heading of the table and the declared requirement set (hybrid or
OTA). Some requirements listed in the table may not be mandatory or they
may apply only regionally. This is further specified in the clause of
each requirement and in table 4.5-1.

For operation in multiple operating bands, the applicability of the
requirements in table 5.3-1 is determined based on the manufacturer
declared AAS BS RAT and single RAT/MSR conformance for each operating
band. The applicability of *multi-band requirements* respective *single
band requirements* is defined in clause 4.9 and in each referred clause
in the table but it cannot be determined by the table itself.

6 Conducted transmitter characteristics
=======================================

6.1 General
-----------

Unless otherwise stated, the transmitter characteristics are specified
with a full complement of transceiver units for the configuration in
normal operating conditions.

*The manufacturer shall declare the minimum number of supported
geographical cells (i.e. geographical areas). The minimum number of
supported geographical cells (N~cells~) relates to the AAS BS setting
with the minimum amount of cell splitting supported with transmission on
all TAB connectors supporting the operating band. The manufacturer shall
also declare TAB connector TX min cell groups.* Every *TAB connector*
supporting transmission in an operating band shall map to one *TAB
connector* *TX min cell group* supporting the same operating band*. The
mapping of TAB connectors to cells is implementation dependent.*

*The number of active transmitter units that are considered when
calculating the emissions limit (N~TXU,\ counted~) for an AAS BS is
calculated as follows:*

N~TXU,\ counted~ = *min(N~TXU,active~ , 8×N~cells~)* for AAS BS in
*single RAT E-UTRA operation* and MSR AAS BS (except UTRA only MSR AAS
BS)

*and*

N~TXU,\ counted~ = *min(N~TXU,active~, 4×N~cells~)* for AAS BS in
*single RAT UTRA operation* and UTRA only MSR AAS BS

*Further:*

N~TXU,countedpercell~ = *N~TXU,counted~ / N~cells~*

N~TXU,countedpercell~ is used for scaling the *basic limits* as
described in subclause 6.6.

NOTE: N~TXU,active~ depends on the actual number of *active transmitter
unit*s and is independent to the declaration of N~cells~.

Any transmitter requirement specified for NB-IoT in-band, NB-IoT guard
band, or standalone NB-IoT operation in 3GPP TS 36.104 \[4\] for E-UTRA
with NB-IoT (in-band or guard band) or for standalone NB-IoT, or in 3GPP
TS 37.104 \[5\] for E-UTRA with NB-IoT or standalone NB-IoT in *MSR
operation*, and referred in clause 6, is not applicable for AAS BS.

Any transmitter requirement specified for Band 46 operation or for Band
49 operation in 3GPP TS 36.104 \[4\] for E-UTRA, or in 3GPP TS 37.104
\[5\] for E-UTRA in *MSR operation*, and referred in clause 6, is not
applicable for AAS BS.

6.2 Base station output power
-----------------------------

### 6.2.1 General

The configured carrier power is the target maximum power for a specific
carrier for the operating mode set in the BS within the limits given by
the manufacturer\'s declaration.

### 6.2.2 Maximum output power

#### 6.2.2.1 General

The rated carrier output power of the AAS BS shall be as specified in

  NOTE: There is no upper limit for the P~Rated,c,sys~ or P~Rated,c,TABC~ of the Wide Area Base Station.                                       

#### 6.2.2.2 Minimum requirement for MSR operation

##### 6.2.2.2.1 General

In normal conditions, P~max,c,TABC~ shall remain within +2 dB and -2 dB
of the configured carrier power for each *TAB connector* as declared by
the manufacturer.

In extreme conditions, P~max,c,TABC~ shall remain within +2,5 dB and
-2,5 dB of the configured carrier power for each *TAB connector* as
declared by the manufacturer.

In certain regions, the minimum requirement for normal conditions may
apply also for some conditions outside the range of conditions defined
as normal.

##### 6.2.2.2.2 Additional requirements (regional)

#### 6.2.2.3 Minimum requirement for single RAT UTRA operation

The minimum requirement for single RAT UTRA BS is the same as that
defined in subclause 6.2.2.2.

### 6.2.5 UTRA FDD additional CPICH power for MIMO mode

#### 6.2.5.1 General

This clause includes requirements on secondary CPICH power level, for
two and four *TAB connector* groups, as well as Demodulation CPICH
requirements. The requirements apply to all *TAB connector* groups
associated with UTRA FDD MIMO transmission as \"antenna 2\", \"antenna
3\" or \"antenna 4\" in the *AAS BS*.

The concept of \"antenna 2\", \"antenna 3\" and \"antenna 4\" is
described in 3GPP TS 25.104 \[2\]. The group(s) of *TAB connector*s
mapped to P-CPICH transmission represents \"antenna 1\".

NOTE 1: The manufacturer declares the mapping of *TAB connector*s to
\"antenna 1\", \"antenna 2\", \"antenna 3\" and \"antenna 4\" (as
defined in 3GPP TS 25.331 \[16\]) where applicable for AAS BS capable of
UTRA FDD operation. The required declarations are specified in TS
37.145-1 \[29\] and TS 37.145-2 \[30\].

For UTRA FDD *AAS BS* operating only \"antenna 1\" and \"antenna 2\",
the secondary CPICH (S-CPICH) power is the *code domain power* of the
Secondary Common Pilot Channel. S-CPICH power is equal to the (dB) sum
of the P‑CPICH power and the power offset, which are signalled to the
UE. The power offset is signalled in the IE \"Power Offset for S-CPICH
for MIMO\", for MIMO mode as defined in clause 10.3.6.41b in 3GPP TS
25.331 \[16\].

When the UE supports MIMO mode with four BS transmit antennas, the power
offset of S-CPICH on antenna 2 is signalled in the IE \"Power Offset for
S-CPICH for MIMO mode with four transmit antennas on Antenna2\" as
defined in subclause 10.3.6.143 in 3GPP TS 25.331 \[16\]. The power
offset of S-CPICH on antenna 3 and 4 is signalled in the IE \"Common
Power Offset for S-CPICH for MIMO mode with four transmit antennas on
Antenna3 and 4\", as defined in subclause 10.3.6.143 in 3GPP TS 25.331
\[16\].

Demodulation CPICH (D-CPICH) power is the *code domain power* of the
Demodulation Common Pilot Channel. D‑CPICH power is equal to the (dB)
sum of the P-CPICH power and the power offset, which are signalled to
the UE. The power offset of D-CPICH on antenna 3 and 4 is signalled in
the IE \"Common Power Offset for D-CPICH for MIMO mode with four
transmit antennas on Antenna3 and 4\", as defined in subclause
10.3.6.143 in 3GPP TS 25.331 \[16\].

NOTE 2: The accuracy level of the power offset for S-CPICH may affect
both MIMO HS-DSCH demodulation and CQI reporting performance.

NOTE 3: The accuracy level of the power offset for D-CPICH transmitted
on antennas 3 and 4 may affect both MIMO HS-DSCH demodulation and CQI
reporting performance.

NOTE 4: At high geometry level PDSCH performance may be affected if
D-CPICH is not scheduled.

NOTE 5: A *TAB connector* group may comprise all *TAB connectors*.

NOTE 6: A *TAB connector* may be mapped to several groups.

#### 6.2.5.2 Minimum requirement for MSR operation

*TAB connectors* mapped to \"antenna 1\", and the S-CPICH power
transmitted at the corresponding group of *TAB connectors* mapped to
\"antenna 2\" shall be within ±2 dB of the IE \"Power Offset for S-CPICH
for MIMO\".

Alternatively, the measured power of the P-CPICH mapped to \"antenna 1\"
and the measured power of the S-CPICH mapped to \"antenna 2\" at each
*TAB connector* shall be within 2 dB of the corresponding IE \"Power
Offset for S-CPICH for MIMO\" that is multiplied by a *TAB connector*
specific beamforming weight and the P-CPICH power level indicated on the
BCH. The same beamforming weights applied to P-CPICH and S-CPICH are set
by the AAS BS to achieve an intended radiated pattern.

When operating MIMO \"antenna 1\", \"antenna 2\", \"antenna 3\", and
\"antenna 4\".

The difference between the P-CPICH power transmitted at the group of
*TAB connectors* mapped to \"antenna 1\", and the S-CPICH power
transmitted at the corresponding group of *TAB connectors* mapped to
\"antenna 2\"shall be within ±2 dB of the IE \"Power Offset for S-CPICH
for MIMO mode with four transmit antennas on Antenna2\".

Antenna2\" that is multiplied by a *TAB connector* specific beamforming
weight and the P-CPICH power level indicated on the BCH. The measured
power of the P-CPICH mapped to \"antenna 1\" and the measured power of
the S-CPICH mapped to \"antenna 3\" and \"antenna 4\", respectively, at
each *TAB connector* shall be within ±2 dB of the corresponding IE
\"Power Offset for S-CPICH for MIMO mode with four transmit antennas on
Antenna3 and 4\" that is multiplied by a *TAB connector* specific
beamforming weight and the P-CPICH power level indicated on the BCH. The
same beamforming weights applied to P-CPICH and S-CPICH are set by the
AAS BS to achieve an intended radiated pattern.

If D-CPICH is scheduled:

The difference between the P-CPICH power transmitted at the group of
*TAB connectors* mapped to \"antenna 1\" and the D-CPICH power
transmitted at the corresponding groups of *TAB connectors* mapped to
\"antenna 3\" and \"antenna 4\" respectively, shall be within ±2 dB of
the IE \"Common Power Offset for D-CPICH for MIMO mode with four
transmit antennas on Antenna3 and 4\".

Alternatively, the measured power of the P-CPICH mapped to \"antenna 1\"
and the measured power of the D-CPICH mapped to \"antenna 3\" and
\"antenna 4\", respectively, at each *TAB connector* shall be within ±2
dB of the corresponding IE \"Common Power Offset for D-CPICH for MIMO
mode with four transmit antennas on Antenna3 and 4\" that is multiplied

6.5.1.2.

#### 6.5.3.3 Minimum requirement for single RAT UTRA operation

This requirement applies to frame timing in Tx diversity, MIMO
transmission, DC-HSDPA, DB-DC-HSDPA, 4C-HSDPA, NC-4C-HSDPA, 8C-HSDPA and
their combinations.

The TAE between any two *TAB connectors* from different transmitter
groups shall not exceed the specified minimum requirements below.

For UTRA FDD, the minimum requirement for time alignment are the same as
those in 3GPP TS 25.104 \[6\], subclause 6.8.4.1.

This requirement applies to frame timing in TX diversity, MIMO
transmission, *carrier aggregation* and their combinations.

The TAE between any two *TAB connectors* from different transmitter
groups shall not exceed the specified minimum requirements below.

For E-UTRA, the minimum requirement for time alignment are the same as
those in 3GPP TS 36.104 \[8\], subclause 6.5.3.1.

### 6.5.4 Modulation quality

#### 6.5.4.1 General

Modulation quality is defined by the difference between the measured
carrier signal and an ideal signal. Modulation quality can be expressed
e.g. as Peak Code domain Error (PCDE) or Relative Code domain Error
(RCDE) or Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) for UTRA and Error Vector
Magnitude (EVM) for E-UTRA.

These requirements apply per *TAB connector*.

#### 6.5.4.2 Minimum requirement for MSR operation

The minimum requirement for a UTRA modulation quality are defined in
subclause 6.5.4.3.

The minimum requirement for an E-UTRA modulation quality are defined in
subclause 6.5.4.4.

The minimum requirement for an NR modulation quality is defined as the
same as those for *BS type 1-H* in 3GPP TS 38.104 \[28\] in subclause
6.5.2.2.

#### 6.5.4.3 Minimum requirement for single RAT UTRA operation

The Error Vector Magnitude is a measure of the difference between the
ideal waveform and the measured waveform. This difference is called the
error vector. Both waveforms pass through a matched Root Raised Cosine
filter to the considered chip rate and roll-off α=0.22. Both waveforms
are then further modified by selecting the frequency, absolute phase,
absolute amplitude and chip clock timing to minimize the error vector.
The EVM result is defined as the square root of the ratio of the mean
error vector power to the mean reference power expressed as a %.

For UTRA FDD the measurement interval is one timeslot as defined by the
C-PICH (when present) otherwise the measurement interval is one timeslot
starting with the beginning of the SCH. The requirement is valid over
the total power dynamic range as specified in subclause 6.3.4.3. The
minimum requirements are the same as those in 3GPP TS 25.104 \[6\],
subclause 6.8.2.1.

For UTRA TDD the measurement interval is one timeslot. The requirement
is valid over the total power dynamic range as specified in subclause
6.3.4.3. See annex C of 3GPP TS 25.142 \[10\] for further details. The
minimum requirements are the same as those in 3GPP TS 25.105 \[7\],
subclause 6.8.2.1.

For UTRA FDD the Peak Code Domain Error is computed by projecting the
error vector onto the code domain at a specified spreading factor. The
Code Domain Error for every code in the domain is defined as the ratio
of the mean power of the projection onto that code, to the mean power of
the composite ideal waveform. This ratio is expressed in dB. The Peak
Code Domain Error is defined as the maximum value for the Code Domain
Error for all codes. The measurement interval is one timeslot as defined
by the C-PICH (when present) otherwise the measurement interval is one
timeslot starting with the beginning of the SCH. The minimum
requirements are the same as those in 3GPP TS 25.104 \[6\], subclause
6.8.3.1.

For UTRA FDD the Relative Code Domain Error is computed by projecting
the error vector onto the code domain at a specified spreading factor.
Only the active code channels in the composite ideal waveform are
considered for this requirement. The Relative Code Domain Error for
every active code is defined as the ratio of the mean power of the error
projection onto that code, to the mean power of the active code in the
composite ideal waveform. This ratio is expressed in dB. The measurement
interval is one frame. The minimum requirements are the same as those in
3GPP TS 25.104 \[6\], subclause 6.8.5.1.

For UTRA TDD 1,28Mcps option, the minimum requirements for modulation
quality, PCDE and RCDE, are the same as in 3GPP TS 25.105 \[7\],
subclauses 6.8.2, 6.8.3 and 6.8.4 respectively. The requirement for
Relative Code Domain Error is only applicable for 64QAM modulated codes
(UTRA FDD and UTRA TDD).

#### 6.5.4.4 Minimum requirement for single RAT E-UTRA operation

For E-UTRA, the minimum requirement for modulation quality, EVM, is
specified in 3GPP TS 36.104 \[8\], subclause 6.5.2.

### 6.5.5 Transmit pulse shape filter

#### 6.5.5.1 General

Transmit pulse shape filter for *single RAT UTRA operation* in FDD and
for *MSR operation* in UTRA FDD is defined in 3GPP TS 25.104 \[6\]
subclause 6.8.1.

Transmit pulse shape filter for *single RAT UTRA operation* in TDD and
for *MSR operation* in UTRA TDD is defined in 3GPP TS 25.105 \[7\]
subclause 6.8.1.

Transmit pulse shape filter is not defined for a *single RAT E-UTRA
operation*, nor for *MSR operation* using E-UTRA and/or NR.

6.6 Unwanted Emissions
----------------------

### 6.6.1 General

Unwanted emissions consist of so-called out-of-band emissions and
spurious emissions according to ITU definitions ITU-R SM.329 \[14\]. In
ITU terminology, out of band emissions are unwanted emissions
immediately outside the *channel bandwidth* resulting from the
modulation process and non-linearity in the transmitter but excluding
spurious emissions. Spurious emissions are emissions which are caused by
unwanted transmitter effects such as harmonics emission, parasitic
emission, intermodulation products and frequency conversion products,
but exclude out of band emissions.

For AAS BS in *single RAT E-UTRA operation* and *MSR operation*, the
out-of-band emissions requirement for the AAS BS transmitter is
specified in terms of an operating band unwanted emissions requirement
that defines limits for emissions in each supported *downlink operating
band* plus the frequency ranges Δf~OBUE~ above and Δf~OBUE~ below each
band, where Δf~OBUE~ is the maximum offset of the operating band
unwanted emission mask from the operating band edge. Emissions outside
of this frequency range are limited by a spurious emissions requirement.
For UTRA FDD single RAT AAS BS, the out of band emission requirement for
AAS BS transmitter is specified in terms of spectrum emission mask
requirement.

The values of Δf~OBUE~ are defined for *hybrid AAS BS* for E-UTRA and
UTRA operating bands in Table 6.6.1-1.

Table 6.6.1-1: Maximum offset of OBUE outside the downlink *operating
band*

  BS type           Operating band characteristics                  Δf~OBUE~ \[MHz\]
  ----------------- ----------------------------------------------- ------------------
  *Hybrid AAS BS*   F~DL\_high~ -- F~DL\_low~ \< 100 MHz            10
                    100 MHz ≤ F~DL\_high~ -- F~DL\_~low ≤ 900 MHz   40

*The unwanted emission level limit of a TAB connector TX min cell group
is in general defined by the unwanted emission basic limit which is the
same as the corresponding applicable non-AAS BS per transmitter
requirement specified in* 3GPP TS 25.104 \[2\], 3GPP TS 25.105 \[3\],
3GPP TS 36.104 \[4\] or 3GPP TS 37.104 \[5\]*, and its scaling by*
N~TXU,countedpercell~. The unwanted emission requirements are applied
per the *TAB connector TX min cell groups for all the configurations
supported by the AAS BS.* The *basic limits* and corresponding scaling
are defined in each relevant subclause.

There is in addition a requirement for occupied bandwidth and an ACLR
requirement.

### 6.6.2 Occupied bandwidth 

#### 6.6.2.1 General

The occupied bandwidth is the width of a frequency band such that, below
the lower and above the upper frequency limits, the mean powers emitted
are each equal to a specified percentage β/2 of the total mean
transmitted power. See also Recommendation ITU-R SM.328 \[17\].

The value of β/2 shall be taken as 0.5%.

The occupied bandwidth requirement applies during the *transmitter ON
period* for a single transmitted carrier. The minimum requirement below
may be applied regionally. There may also be regional requirements to
declare the occupied bandwidth according to the definition in the
present clause.

#### 6.6.2.2 Minimum requirement for MSR operation

For MSR AAS BS, the minimum requirement for occupied bandwidth is the
same as that stated in 3GPP TS 37.104 \[9\], subclause 6.6.3.

#### 6.6.2.3 Minimum requirement for single RAT UTRA operation

For single RAT UTRA FDD AAS BS, the minimum requirement for occupied
bandwidth is the same as that stated in 3GPP TS 25.104 \[6\] subclause
6.6.1.

For single RAT UTRA TDD, 1,28Mcps option AAS BS, the minimum requirement
for occupied bandwidth is the same as that stated in 3GPP TS 25.105
\[7\], subclause 6.6.1.

#### 6.6.2.4 Minimum requirement for single RAT E-UTRA operation

For single RAT E-UTRA AAS BS, the minimum requirement for occupied
bandwidth is the same as that stated in 3GPP TS 36.104 \[8\], subclause
6.6.1.

### 6.6.3 Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio

#### 6.6.3.1 General

Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR) is the ratio of the filtered
mean power centred on the assigned channel frequency to the filtered
mean power centred on an adjacent channel frequency.

NOTE: Conformance to the AAS BS ACLR requirement can be demonstrated by
meeting at least one of the following criteria as determined by the
manufacturer:

> 1\) The ratio of the sum of the filtered mean power measured on each
> *TAB connector* in the *TAB connector TX min cell group* at the
> assigned channel frequency to the sum of the filtered mean power
> measured on each *TAB connector* in the *TAB connector TX min cell
> group* at the adjacent channel frequency shall be greater than or
> equal to the ACLR limit of AAS BS. This applies for each *TAB
> connector TX min cell group*.
>
> Or
>
> 2\) The ratio of the filtered mean power at the *TAB connector*
> centred on the assigned channel frequency to the filtered mean power
> at each *TAB connector* centred on the adjacent channel frequency
> shall be greater than or equal to the ACLR limit of AAS BS for every
> *TAB connector* in the *TAB connector TX min cell group*, for each
> *TAB connector TX min cell group*.

In case the ACLR absolute limit of AAS BS is applied, the conformance
can be demonstrated by meeting at least one of the following criteria as
determined by the manufacturer:

1\) The sum of the filtered mean power measured on each *TAB connector*
in the *TAB connector TX min cell group* at the adjacent channel
frequency shall be less than or equal to the ACLR absolute limit AAS BS.
This applies to each *TAB connector TX min cell group.*

> Or
>
> 2\) The filtered mean power at each *TAB connector* centred on the
> adjacent channel frequency shall be less than or equal to the ACLR
> absolute limit of AAS BS scaled by -10log~10~(*n*) for every *TAB
> connector* in the *TAB connector TX min cell group*, for each *TAB
> connector TX min cell group*, where *n* is the number of *TAB
> connectors* in the *TAB connector TX min cell group.*

*basic limits* are also the same as the absolute limits of MSR E-UTRA
and/or NR operation specified in 3GPP TS 37.104 \[9\] subclauses
6.6.4.1. The ACLR absolute limit of AAS BS is specified as the *basic
limit* + 10log~10~(N~TXU,countedpercell~). The ACLR limit or the ACLR
absolute limit of AAS BS, whichever is less stringent, shall apply
outside the *Base Station RF Bandwidth* or *Radio Bandwidth*.

in *non-contiguous spectrum*, the ACLR requirement also applies for the
first adjacent channel inside any *sub-block gap* with a gap size W~gap~
≥ 15MHz. The ACLR requirement for the second adjacent channel applies
inside any *sub-block gap* with a gap size W~gap~ ≥ 20 MHz.

CACLR requirements apply in *sub-block gaps* as defined in 3GPP TS
37.104 \[9\], subclause 6.6.4.4. Either the CACLR limit or the ACLR
absolute limit of AAS BS shall apply, whichever is less stringent.

For a *multi-band TAB connector* or *TAB connector cell group*
supporting operation in multiple operating bands through *multi-band TAB
connectors*, the ACLR requirement also applies for the first adjacent
channel inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* with a gap size W~gap~ ≥
15MHz. The ACLR requirement for the second adjacent channel applies
inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* with a gap size W~gap~ ≥ 20 MHz.

(CACLR) absolute *basic limits* of AAS BS are specified as the *basic
limit* + 10log~10~(N~TXU,countedpercell~). The ACLR (CACLR) limit or the
ACLR (CACLR) absolute *basic limit* of AAS BS shall apply, whichever is
less stringent.

For single RAT UTRA TDD 1,28 Mcps operation, the AAS BS minimum
requirements are the same as those specified in 3GPP TS 25.105 \[7\],

##### 6.6.4.3.2 Basic limits for single RAT UTRA FDD operation

The *basic limit* is specified in tables 6.6.4.3.2-1 to 6.6.4.3.2-10 for
the appropriate P~Rated,c,sys~, where:

\- ∆f is the separation between the carrier frequency and the nominal
-3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to the carrier frequency.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the carrier frequency and the
centre of the measurement filter;

\- f\_offset~max~ is either 12.5 MHz or the offset to the UMTS Tx band
edge as defined in clause 5.2, whichever is the greater.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

Inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gaps* with Wgap \< 2×Δf~OBUE~ for a
*multi-band TAB connector*, emissions shall not exceed the cumulative
sum of the *basic limits* specified at the *Base Station RF Bandwidth
edges* on each side of the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*. The *basic limit*
for *Base Station RF Bandwidth edge* is specified in tables 6.6.4.3.2-1
to 6.6.4.3.2-10 below, where in this case:

\- ∆f is equal to 2.5MHz plus the separation between the *Base Station
RF Bandwidth edge* frequency and the nominal -3dB point of the measuring
filter closest to the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edge*.

\- f\_offset is equal to 2.5MHz plus the separation between the *Base
Station RF Bandwidth* edge frequency and the centre of the measuring
filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is either 12.5 MHz or the offset to the UMTS Tx band
edge as defined in clause 5.2, whichever is the greater.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

For a *multi-band TAB connector*, the operating band unwanted emission
*basic limits* apply also in a supported operating band without any
carrier transmitted, in the case where there are carrier(s) transmitted
in another supported operating band. In this case, no cumulative limit
is applied in the *inter-band gap* between a supported *downlink
operating band* with carrier(s) transmitted and a supported *downlink
operating band* without any carrier transmitted and

\- In case the *inter-band gap* between a downlink band with carrier(s)
transmitted and a downlink band without any carrier transmitted is less
than 2×Δf~OBUE~, f\_offset~max~ shall be the offset to the frequency
Δf~OBUE~ outside the outermost edges of the two *downlink operating
band*s and the operating band unwanted emission limit of the band where
there are carriers transmitted, as defined in the tables of the present
subclause, shall apply across both downlink bands.

\- In other cases, the operating band unwanted emission limit of the
band where there are carriers transmitted, as defined in the tables of
the present subclause for the largest frequency offset (∆f~max~), shall
apply from Δf~OBUE~ below the lowest frequency, up to Δf~OBUE~ above the
highest frequency of the *downlink operating band* without any carrier
transmitted.

Inside any *sub-block gap* for a *TAB connector* operating in
*non-contiguous spectrum*, emissions shall not exceed the cumulative sum
of the *basic limits* specified for the adjacent sub blocks on each side
of the *sub-block gap*. The *basic limit* for each sub block is
specified in tables 6.6.4.3.2-1 to 6.6.4.3.2-10 below, where in this
case:

\- ∆f is equal to 2.5MHz plus the separation between the sub block edge
frequency and the nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to
the sub block edge.

\- f\_offset is equal to 2.5MHz plus the separation between the sub
block edge frequency and the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is equal to the *sub-block gap* bandwidth minus half
of the bandwidth of the measuring filter plus 2.5MHz.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

In certain regions the following requirement may apply for protection of
DTT. For a *TAB connector* operating in Band XX, the level of emissions
in the band 470-790 MHz, measured in an 8MHz filter bandwidth on centre
frequencies F~filter~ according to table 6.6.4.3.2-8, shall not exceed
the maximum emission *basic limit* P~EM,N~ declared by the manufacturer.

NOTE: The regional requirement is defined in terms of EIRP (effective
isotropic radiated power), which is dependent on both the BS emissions
at the antenna connector and the deployment (including antenna gain and
feeder loss). The *basic limit* defined above provides the
characteristics of the AAS base station needed to verify compliance with
the regional requirement. Compliance with the regional requirement for
protection of DTT can be determined using the method outlined in annex D
of 3GPP TS 25.104 \[2\].

In certain regions, the following *basic limits* may apply to a *TAB
connector* operating in Band XXXII within 1452-1492 MHz. The level of
unwanted emissions, measured on centre frequencies f\_offset with filter
bandwidth, according to table 6.6.4.3.2-9, shall neither exceed the

NOTE: The regional requirement, included in CEPT ECC Decision (13)03

above provides the characteristics of the base station needed to verify
compliance with the regional requirement. The assessment of the EIRP
level is described in annex H of 3GPP TS 36.104 \[4\].

In certain regions, the following *basic limit* may apply to *TAB
connector* operating in Band XXXII within 1452-1492MHz for the
protection of services in spectrum adjacent to the frequency range
1452-1492 MHz. The level of emissions, measured on centre frequencies
F~filter~ with filter bandwidth according to table 6.6.4.3.2-10, shall
neither exceed the maximum emission *basic limit* P~EM,B32,d~ nor
P~EM,B32,e~ declared by the manufacturer. This requirement applies in
the frequency range 1429-1518MHz even though part of the range falls in
the spurious domain.

Notes for the tables in this subclause:

NOTE 3: This frequency range ensures that the range of values of
f\_offset is continuous.

NOTE 4: As a general rule, the resolution bandwidth of the measuring
equipment should be equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to
improve measurement accuracy, sensitivity and efficiency, the resolution
bandwidth can be smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When the
resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the
result should be integrated over the measurement bandwidth in order to
obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.

##### 6.6.4.3.3 *Basic limits* for single RAT UTRA TDD 1,28Mcps operation

The *basic limit* is specified in tables 6.6.4.3.3-1 to 6.6.4.3.3-3 for
the appropriate P~Rated,c,sy~, where:

The mask defined in table 6.6.4.3.3-1 to 6.6.4.3.3-3 may be mandatory in
certain regions. In other regions this mask may not be applied.

For regions where this clause applies, the *basic limit* is for a *TAB
connector* transmitting on a single RF carrier configured in accordance
with the manufacturer\'s specification. Emissions shall use the *basic
limits* specified in table 6.6.4.3.3-1 to 6.6.4.3.3-3 for the
appropriate P~rated,c,cell~, in the frequency range from ∆f = 0.8 MHz to
∆f ~max~ from the carrier frequency, where:

\- ∆f is the separation between the carrier frequency and the nominal
-3dB point of the measuring filter closest to the carrier frequency.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the carrier frequency and the
centre frequency of the measuring filter.- f\_offset~max~ is either
4 MHz or the offset to the UTRA TDD Tx band edge as defined in subclause
4.6, whichever is the greater.

\- ∆f ~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of
the measurement filter. Inside any *Inter RF bandwidth gaps* with
W~gap~ \< 8 MHz for *multi-band TAB connector*, emissions shall not
exceed the cumulative sum of the *basic limit*s specified at the ***Base
Station RF bandwidth edges*** on each side of *Inter RF bandwidth gap*.
The *basic limit* for ***Base Station RF bandwidth edge*** is specified
in tables 6.6.4.3.3-1 to 6.6.4.3.3-3 below, where in this case.

\- ∆f equal to 0.8MHz plus the separation between the ***Base Station RF
bandwidth edge*** frequency and the nominal -3dB point of the measuring
filter closest to the ***Base Station RF bandwidth edge***.

\- f\_offset is equal to 0.8MHz plus the separation between the ***Base
Station RF bandwidth edge*** frequency and the centre frequency of the
measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is either 4 MHz or the offset to the UTRA TDD Tx band
edge as defined in subclause 4.6, whichever is the greater.

\- ∆f max is equal to f\_offsetmax minus half of the bandwidth of the
measurement filter.

For a multi-carrier *TAB connector*, the definitions above apply to the
lower edge of the carrier transmitted at the lowest carrier frequency
and the upper edge of the carrier transmitted at the highest carrier
frequency within a specified frequency.

#### 6.6.4.4 Minimum requirement for single RAT E-UTRA operation

There is no spectrum emission mask requirement for a single RAT E-UTRA
AAS BS.

### 6.6.5 Operating band unwanted emission

#### 6.6.5.1 General

Unless otherwise stated, for E-UTRA single band and MSR the operating
band unwanted emission limits are defined from Δf~OBUE~ below the lowest
frequency of each supported *downlink operating band* to the lower *Base
Station RF Bandwidth edge* located at F~BW\ RF,low~ and from the upper
*Base Station RF Bandwidth edge* located at F~BW\ RF,high~ up to
Δf~OBUE~ above the highest frequency of each supported *downlink
operating band*. The values of Δf~OBUE~ are defined in table 6.6.1-1.

For AAS BS capable of operation in multiple operating bands, using
*single band TAB connector*s, the single-band requirements apply to
those connectors and the cumulative evaluation of the emission limit in
the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* is not applicable.

The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered
and for all transmission modes foreseen by the manufacturer\'s
specification.

#### 6.6.5.2 Minimum requirement for MSR operation

##### 6.6.5.2.1 General

The MSR operating band unwanted emission *basic limit*s are the same as
those specified in 3GPP TS 37.104 \[9\], subclauses 6.6.2.1, 6.6.2.2 and
6.6.2.4.

The operating band unwanted emission requirements for an MSR AAS BS are
that for each *TAB connector TX min cell group* and each applicable
*basic limit* as specified in 3GPP TS 37.104 \[5\], the power summation
of the emissions at the *TAB connectors* of the *TAB connector TX min
cell group* shall not exceed an AAS BS limit specified as the *basic
limit* + 10log~10~(N~TXU,countedpercell~).

NOTE: Conformance to the AAS BS operating band unwanted emission
requirement can be demonstrated by meeting at least one of the following
criteria as determined by the manufacturer:

> 1\) The sum of the emissions power measured on each *TAB connector* in
> the *TAB connector TX min cell group* shall be less than or equal to
> the AAS BS limit as defined in this subclause for the respective
> frequency span.
>
> Or
>
> 2\) The unwanted emissions power at each *TAB connector* shall be less
> than or equal to the AAS BS limit as defined in this subclause for the
> respective frequency span, scaled by -10log~10~(*n*), where *n* is the
> number of *TAB connector* in the *TAB connector TX min cell group*.

##### 6.6.5.2.2 *Basic limits* for Band Categories 1 and 3

For a *TAB connector* operating in Band Category 1 or Band Category 3
the requirement applies outside the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edges*.
In addition, for an AAS BS of Wide Area BS class operating in
*non-contiguous spectrum*, it applies inside any *sub-block gap*. In
addition, for an AAS BS of Wide Area BS class operating in multiple
bands, the requirements apply inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*.

For an AAS BS of Medium Range BS class operating in Band Category 1 the
requirement applies outside the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edges*. In
addition, for an AAS BS of Medium Range BS class operating in
*non-contiguous spectrum*, it applies inside any *sub-block gap*. In
addition, for an AAS BS of Medium Range BS class operating in multiple
bands, the requirements apply inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*.

For an AAS BS of Local Area BS class operating in Band Category 1 the
requirement applies outside the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edges*. In
addition, for an AAS BS of Local Area BS class operating in
*non-contiguous spectrum*, it applies inside any *sub-block gap*. In
addition, for an AAS BS Local Area BS class operating in multiple bands,
the requirements apply inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*.

Outside the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edges*, *basic limits* are
specified in tables 6.6.5.2.2-1 to 6.6.5.2.2-4 below, where:

\- ∆f is the separation between *the Base Station RF Bandwidth edge*
frequency and the nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to
the carrier frequency.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the *Base Station RF Bandwidth
edge* frequency and the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is the offset to the frequency Δf~OBUE~ outside the
*downlink operating band*.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

For a *multi-band TAB connector*, inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gaps*
with Wgap \< 2×Δf~OBUE~ MHz, a combined *basic* limit shall be applied
which is the cumulative sum of emissions shall not exceed the cumulative
sum of the *basic limits* specified at the *Base Station RF Bandwidth
edges* on each side of the *Inter-RF Bandwidth gap*. The *basic limit*
for *Base Station RF Bandwidth edge* is specified in table 6.6.5.2.2-1
to 6.6.5.2.2-4 below, where in this case:

\- ∆f is the separation between the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edge*
frequency and the nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to
the carrier frequency.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the *Base Station RF Bandwidth
edge* frequency and the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is equal to the inter *Base Station RF Bandwidth* gap
minus half of the bandwidth of the measuring filter.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offsetmax minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

For a *multi-band TAB connector*, the operating band unwanted emission
*basic limits* apply also in a supported operating band without any
carriers transmitted, in the case where there are carriers transmitted
in other operating band(s). In this case where there is no carrier
transmitted in an operating band, the operating band unwanted emission
limit, as defined in the tables of the present subclause for the largest
frequency offset (∆f~max~), of a band where there is no carrier
transmitted shall apply from 10 MHz below the lowest frequency, up to 10
MHz above the highest frequency of the supported downlink operating band
without any carrier transmitted. And no cumulative *basic limits* are
applied in the *inter-band gap* between a supported downlink band with
carrier(s) transmitted and a supported downlink band without any carrier
transmitted.

Inside any *sub-block gap* for a *TAB connector* operating in
*non-contiguous spectrum*, a combined *basic* limit shall be applied
which is the cumulative sum of the *basic limits* specified for the
adjacent sub blocks on each side of the *sub-block gap*. The *basic
limit* for each sub block is specified in tables 6.6.5.2.2-1 to
6.6.5.2.2-4 below, where in this case:

\- ∆f is the separation between the sub block edge frequency and the
nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to the sub block
edge.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the sub block edge frequency and
the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is equal to the *sub-block gap* bandwidth minus half
of the bandwidth of the measuring filter.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

Applicability of Wide Area operating band unwanted emission requirements
in tables 6.6.5.2.2-1, 6.6.5.2.2-1a and 6.6.5.2.2-1b is specified in
table 6.6.2.1-0.

Note: Option 1 and Option 2 correspond to the Category B option 1/2
operating band unwanted emissions defined in the E-UTRA and NR
specifications TS 36.104 \[4\] and TS 38.104 \[27\]. Option 2 also
corresponds to the UTRA spectrum emission mask as defined in TS 25.104
\[2\].

NOTE 3: This frequency range ensures that the range of values of
f\_offset is continuous.

NOTE 4: As a general rule for the requirements in the present subclause,
the resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment should be equal to
the measurement bandwidth. However, to improve measurement accuracy,
sensitivity and efficiency, the resolution bandwidth may be smaller than
the measurement bandwidth. When the resolution bandwidth is smaller than
the measurement bandwidth, the result should be integrated over the
measurement bandwidth in order to obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth
of the measurement bandwidth.

NOTE 5: The requirement is not applicable when ∆f~max~ \< 10 MHz.

##### 6.6.5.2.3 *Basic limit* for Band Category 2

For a *TAB connector* operating in Band Category 2 the requirement
applies outside the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edges*. In addition, for
a *TAB connector* operating in *non-contiguous spectrum*, it applies
inside any *sub-block gap*.

Outside the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edges*, *basic limits* are
specified in tables 6.6.5.2.3-1 to 6.6.5.2.3-8 below, where:

\- ∆f is the separation between the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edge*
frequency and the nominal -3dB point of the measuring filter closest to
the carrier frequency.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the *Base Station RF Bandwidth
edge* frequency and the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is the offset to the frequency Δf~OBUE~ outside the
*downlink operating band*.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

For a *multi-band TAB connector*, inside any *Inter-RF Bandwidth gaps*
with Wgap \< 2×Δf~OBUE~ MHz, a combined *basic* limit shall be applied
which is the cumulative sum of the *basic limit*s specified at the *Base
Station RF Bandwidth edges* on each side of the *Inter-RF Bandwidth
gap*. The *basic limit* for *Base Station RF Bandwidth edge* is
specified in table 6.6.5.2.3-1 to 6.6.5.2.3-8 below, where in this case:

\- ∆f is the separation between the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edge*
frequency and the nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to
the carrier frequency.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the *Base Station RF Bandwidth
edge* frequency and the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is equal to the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* minus half of
the bandwidth of the measuring filter.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offsetmax minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

For a *multi-band TAB connector* where multiple bands are mapped on the
same antenna connector and where there is no carrier transmitted in an
operating band, the operating band unwanted emission limit, as defined
in the tables of the present subclause for the largest frequency offset
(∆f~max~), of a band where there is no carrier transmitted shall apply
from 10 MHz below the lowest frequency, up to 10 MHz above the highest
frequency of the supported downlink operating band without any carrier
transmitted. And no cumulative *basic limits* are applied in the
*inter-band gap* between a supported downlink band with carrier(s)
transmitted and a supported downlink band without any carrier
transmitted.

Inside any *sub-block gap* for a *TAB connector* operating in
*non-contiguous spectrum*, a combined *basic* limit shall be applied
which is the cumulative sum of the *basic limit* specified for the
adjacent sub blocks on each side of the *sub-block gap*. The *basic
limit* for each sub block is specified in tables 6.6.5.2.3-1 to
6.6.5.2.3-8 below, where in this case:

\- ∆f is the separation between the sub block edge frequency and the
nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to the sub block
edge.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the sub block edge frequency and
the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is equal to the *sub-block gap* bandwidth minus half
of the bandwidth of the measuring filter.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

Applicability of Wide Area operating band unwanted emission requirements
in Tables 6.6.5.2.31, 6.6.5.2.3-1a and 6.6.5.2.3-1b is specified in
table 6.6.5.2.3-0.

Note: Option 1 and option 2 correspond to the Category B option 1/2
operating band unwanted emissions defined in the E-UTRA and NR
specifications TS 36.104 \[4\] and TS 38.104 \[27\]. Option 2 also
corresponds to the UTRA spectrum emission mask as defined in TS 25.104
\[2\].

+----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+

The following notes are common to all subclauses in 6.6.5.2.3:

NOTE 9: This frequency range ensures that the range of values of
f\_offset is continuous.

NOTE 10: As a general rule for the requirements in the present
subclause, the resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment should be
equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to improve measurement
accuracy, sensitivity and efficiency, the resolution bandwidth may be
smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When the resolution bandwidth is
smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the result should be integrated
over the measurement bandwidth in order to obtain the equivalent noise
bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.

NOTE 11: The requirement is not applicable when ∆f~max~ \< 10 MHz.

NOTE 12: All limits in table 6.6.5.2.3‑1, table 6.6.5.2.3‑3,
table 6.6.5.2.3‑4 and table 6.6.5.2.3‑7 are identical to the
corresponding limits for Band Category 1 and 3.

##### 6.6.5.2.4 Additional requirements

The MSR operating band unwanted emission *basic limit*s for additional
requirements are the same as the *basic limit*s specified in 3GPP TS
37.104 \[9\], subclause 6.6.2.4.

#### 6.6.5.3 Minimum requirement for single RAT UTRA operation

There is no operating band unwanted emission requirement for a single
RAT UTRA FDD or single RAT UTRA TDD AAS BS.

#### 6.6.5.4 Minimum requirement for single RAT E-UTRA operation

##### 6.6.5.4.1 General

The single RAT E-UTRA operating band unwanted emission *basic limit*s
are given in subclauses 6.6.5.4.2, 6.6.5.4.3 and 6.6.5.4.4.

The operating band unwanted emission requirements for AAS BS in *single
RAT E-UTRA operation* are that for each *TAB connector TX min cell
group* and each applicable *basic limit*, the power sum of the emissions
at the *TAB connectors* of the *TAB connector TX min cell group* shall
not exceed an AAS limit specified as the *basic limit* +
10log~10~(N~TXU,countedpercell~).

NOTE: Conformance to the AAS BS operating band unwanted emission
requirement can be demonstrated by meeting at least one of the following
criteria as determined by the manufacturer:

> 1\) The sum of the emissions power measured on each *TAB connector* in
> the *TAB connector TX min cell group* shall be less than or equal to
> the AAS BS limit as defined in this subclause for the respective
> frequency span.
>
> Or
>
> 2\) The unwanted emissions power at each *TAB connector* shall be less
> than or equal to the AAS BS limit as defined in this subclause for the
> respective frequency span, scaled by -10log~10~(*n*), where *n* is the
> number of *TAB connectors* in the *TAB connector TX min cell group*.

The requirements shall apply whatever the type of *TAB connector* is
considered (single carrier or multi-carrier) and for all transmission
modes foreseen by the manufacturer\'s specification. In addition, for a
*TAB connector* operating in *non-contiguous spectrum*, the requirements
apply inside any *sub-block gap*. In addition, for a *multi-band TAB
connector* the requirements apply inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*.

The unwanted emission *basic limits* in the part of the *downlink
operating band* that falls in the spurious domain are consistent with
ITU-R Recommendation SM.329 \[14\].

Emissions shall use the *basic limits* specified in the tables below,
where:

\- ∆f is the separation between the channel edge frequency and the
nominal -3dB point of the measuring filter closest to the carrier
frequency.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the channel edge frequency and
the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is the offset to the frequency Δf~OBUE~ outside the
*downlink operating band*.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

For a *multi-band TAB connector* inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gaps*
with W~gap~ \< 2×Δf~OBUE~ MHz, a combined *basic* limit shall be applied
which is the cumulative sum of the *basic limit*s specified at the *Base
Station RF Bandwidth edges* on each side of the *Inter RF Bandwidth
gap*. The *basic limit* for *Base Station RF Bandwidth edge* is
specified in the tables subclause 6.6.5.4.2 to 6.6.5.4.7 below, where in
this case:

\- ∆f is the separation between the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edge*
frequency and the nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to
the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edge*.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the *Base Station RF Bandwidth
edge* frequency and the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is equal to the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* minus half of
the bandwidth of the measuring filter.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

For *multi-band TAB connector* where multiple bands are mapped on the
same antenna connector, the operating band unwanted emission *basic*
*limits* apply also in a supported operating band without any carrier
transmitted, in the case where there are carrier(s) transmitted in other
supported operating band(s). In this case where there is no carrier
transmitted in an operating band, the operating band unwanted emission
limit, as defined in the tables of the present subclause for the largest
frequency offset (∆f~max~), of a band where there is no carrier
transmitted shall apply from 10 MHz below the lowest frequency, up to 10
MHz above the highest frequency of the supported downlink operating band
without any carrier transmitted. And no cumulative *basic limit* is
applied in the *inter-band gap* between a supported downlink operating
band with carrier(s) transmitted and a supported downlink operating band
without any carrier transmitted.

For a multicarrier E-UTRA *TAB connector* or a *TAB connector*
configured for intra-band contiguous or non-contiguous *carrier
aggregation* the definitions above apply to the lower edge of the
carrier transmitted at the lowest carrier frequency and the upper edge
of the carrier transmitted at the highest carrier frequency within a
specified frequency band.

In addition inside any *sub-block gap* for a *TAB connector* operating
in *non-contiguous spectrum*, a combined *basic* limit shall be applied
which is the cumulative sum of the *basic limit*s specified for the
adjacent sub blocks on each side of the *sub-block gap*. The *basic
limit* for each sub block is specified in the tables subclause 6.6.5.4.2
to 6.6.5.4.7 below, where in this case:

\- ∆f is the separation between the sub block edge frequency and the
nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to the sub block
edge.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the sub block edge frequency and
the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is equal to the *sub-block gap* bandwidth minus half
of the bandwidth of the measuring filter.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

For an AAS BS of Wide Area BS class, the requirements of either
subclause 6.6.5.4.2 (Category A limits) or subclause 6.6.5.4.3 (Category
B limits) shall apply.

For an AAS BS of Local Area BS class, the requirements of subclause
6.6.5.4.4 shall apply (Category A and B).

For an AAS BS of Medium Range BS class, the requirements in subclause
6.6.5.4.5 shall apply (Category A and B).

The application of either Category A or Category B *basic limits* shall
be the same as for Transmitter spurious emissions (Mandatory
Requirements) in subclause 6.6.6.

##### 6.6.5.4.2 Basic limits for Wide Area BS (Category A)

For E-UTRA *TAB connector* operating in Bands 5, 6, 8, 12, 13, 14, 17,
18, 19, 26, 27, 28, 29, 31, 44, 68, 71, 72, 73, 85, 87, 88 the *basic

MHz below the lowest frequency of each operating band to 4 MHz above the
highest frequency of each operating band.

\- UTRA FDD BS as specified in TS 25.104 \[2\]: from 12.5MHz below the
lowest carrier frequency used up to 12.5MHz above the highest carrier

For some operating bands the upper frequency limit is higher than
12.75 GHz in order to comply with the 5^th^ harmonic limit of the
*downlink operating band*, as specified in ITU-R recommendation SM.329
\[14\]. In some exceptional cases, requirements apply also closer than

band.

The requirements apply for both *single band* *TAB connectors* and
*multi-band* *TAB connectors* (except for frequencies at which exclusion
bands or other multi-band provisions apply) and for all transmission
modes foreseen by the manufacturer\'s specification. Unless otherwise
stated, all requirements are measured as mean power.

For operation in Region 2, where the FCC guidance for MIMO systems in

*TAB connectors* of the *TAB connector TX min cell* *group* shall not
exceed an AAS limit specified as the *basic limit* + X, where X =
10log~10~(N~TXU,countedpercell~), unless stated differently in regional
regulation.

NOTE: Conformance to the AAS BS spurious emission requirement can be
demonstrated by meeting at least one of the following criteria as
determined by the manufacturer:

> 1\) The sum of the emissions power measured on each *TAB connector* in
> the *TAB connector TX min cell group* shall be less than or equal to
> the AAS BS limit as defined in this subclause for the respective
> frequency span.
>
> Or

> than or equal to the AAS BS limit as defined in this subclause for the
> respective frequency span, scaled by -10log~10~(*n*), where *n* is the
> number of *TAB connectors* in the *TAB connector TX min cell group*.

The single RAT UTRA FDD spurious emission *basic limits* are the same as
those specified in 3GPP TS 25.104 \[6\], subclauses 6.6.3.1-6.6.3.8.

The single RAT UTRA TDD spurious emission *basic limits* are the same as
those specified in 3GPP TS 25.105 \[7\], subclauses 6.6.3.1-6.6.3.5.

for each *TAB connector TX min cell group* and each applicable *basic
limit* as specified in 3GPP TS 25.104 \[6\] or 3GPP TS 25.105 \[7\], the
power sum of the emissions at the *TAB connector*s associated with the
*TAB connector TX min cell group* shall not exceed an AAS limit
specified as the *basic limit* + X, where X =
10log~10~(N~TXU,countedpercell~), unless stated differently in regional
regulation.

NOTE: Conformance to the AAS BS spurious emission requirement can be
demonstrated by meeting at least one of the following criteria as
determined by the manufacturer:

> 1\) The sum of the emissions power measured on each *TAB connector* in
> the *TAB connector TX min cell group* shall be less than or equal to

S*ingle RAT E-UTRA operation* spurious emission *basic limits* are the
same as those specified in 3GPP TS 36.104 \[8\], subclauses
6.6.4.1-6.6.4.4. Spurious emission limits specified in TS 36.104 \[8\],
subclauses 6.6.4.1-6.6.4.4 for Band 41, Band 46 and Band 49 are not
applicable for AAS BS.

The spurious emission requirements for AAS BS in *single RAT E-UTRA
operation* are that for each *TAB connector TX min cell group* and for
each applicable *basic limit* as specified in 3GPP TS 36.104 \[4\], the

6.7 Transmitter intermodulation
-------------------------------

### 6.7.1 General

The transmitter intermodulation requirement is a measure of the
capability of the transmitter unit to inhibit the generation of signals
in its non-linear elements caused by presence of the wanted signal and
an interfering signal reaching the transmitter unit via the RDN and
antenna array. The requirement applies during the *transmitter ON
period* and the *transmitter transient period*.

The requirement applies at each *TAB connector* supporting transmission
in the operating band.

The transmitter intermodulation level is the power of the
intermodulation products when an interfering signal is injected into the
*TAB connector*.

For AAS BS there are two types of transmitter intermodulation cases
captured by the transmitter intermodulation requirement:

1\) Co-location transmitter intermodulation in which the interfering
signal is from a co-located base station.

2\) Intra-system transmitter intermodulation in which the interfering
signal is from other transmitter units within the AAS BS.

For AAS BS, the co-location transmitter intermodulation requirement is
considered sufficient if the interfering signal for the co-location
requirement is higher than the declared interfering signal for
intra-system transmitter intermodulation requirement.

### 6.7.2 Minimum requirement for MSR operation

#### 6.7.2.1 General co-location minimum requirement

The transmitter intermodulation level shall not exceed the unwanted
emission limits specified for transmitter spurious emission in subclause
6.6.6, operating band unwanted emission in subclause 6.6.5 and ACLR in
subclause 6.6.3 in the presence of a wanted signal and an interfering
signal according to table 6.7.2.1‑1 for AAS BS operation in BC1, BC2 and
BC3.

The requirement is applicable outside the *Base Station RF Bandwidth
edges*. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the *Base
Station RF Bandwidth* *edges* or *Radio Bandwidth* edges.

For *TAB connectors* supporting operation in *non-contiguous spectrum*,
the requirement is also applicable inside a *sub-block gap* for
interfering signal offsets where the interfering signal falls completely
within the *sub-block gap*. The interfering signal offset is defined
relative to the *sub-block* edges.

For *TAB connectors* supporting operation in multiple operating bands,
the requirement applies relative to the *Base Station RF Bandwidth*
*edges* of each operating band. In case the inter *Base Station RF
Bandwidth* gap is less than 15 MHz, the requirement in the gap applies
only for interfering signal offsets where the interfering signal falls
completely within the inter *Base Station RF Bandwidth* gap.

in BC1 or BC2, the requirement is also applicable inside a *sub-block
gap* with a gap size larger than or equal to two times the interfering
signal centre frequency offset. For *TAB connectors* supporting
operation in *non-contiguous spectrum* in BC1, the requirement is not
applicable inside a *sub-block gap* with a gap size equal to or larger
than 5 MHz. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the
*sub-block* edges.

For *TAB connectors* supporting operation in multiple operating bands,
the requirement applies relative to the *Base Station RF Bandwidth*
*edges* of a BC2 operating band. The requirement is also applicable for
BC1 and BC2 inside an inter *Base Station RF Bandwidth* gap equal to or
larger than two times the interfering signal centre frequency offset.
For *TAB connectors* supporting operation in multiple operating bands,
the requirement is not applicable for BC1 band inside an inter *Base
Station RF Bandwidth* gap with a gap size equal to or larger than 5 MHz.

  NOTE: Interfering signal positions that are partially or completely outside of any *downlink operating band* of the *TAB connector* are excluded from the requirement.   

#### 6.7.2.3 Additional co-location minimum requirement (BC3)

This additional requirement shall only apply for BS co-located with an
UTRA TDD BS.

The transmitter intermodulation level shall not exceed the unwanted
emission limits specified for transmitter spurious emission in subclause
6.6.6, operating band unwanted emission in subclause 6.6.5 and ACLR in
subclause 6.6.3 in the presence of a wanted signal and an interfering
signal according to table 6.7.2.3-1 for AAS BS operation in BC3.

For *TAB connectors* supporting operation in multiple operating bands,
the requirement applies relative to *the Base Station RF Bandwidth*
*edges* of each operating band. In case the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* is
less than 3.2 MHz, the requirement in the gap applies only for
interfering signal offsets where the interfering signal falls completely
within the inter *Base Station RF Bandwidth* gap.

### 6.7.4 Minimum requirement for single RAT E-UTRA operation

#### 6.7.4.1 General co-location minimum requirement

The transmitter intermodulation level shall not exceed the unwanted
emission limits in subclauses 6.6.6, 6.6.5 and 6.6.3 in the presence of
an E-UTRA interfering signal according to table 6.7.4.1‑1.

The requirement is applicable outside the *Base Station RF Bandwidth* or
*Radio Bandwidth*. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to
the *Base Station RF Bandwidth* *edges* or *Radio Bandwidth* edges.

For *TAB connectors* supporting operation in *non-contiguous spectrum*,
the requirement is also applicable inside a *sub-block gap* for
interfering signal offsets where the interfering signal falls completely
within the *sub-block gap*. The interfering signal offset is defined
relative to the *sub-block* edges.

For *TAB connectors* supporting operation in multiple operating bands,
the requirement applies relative to the *Base Station RF Bandwidth*
*edges* of each supported operating band. In case the inter *Base
Station RF Bandwidth* gap is less than 15 MHz, the requirement in the
gap applies only for interfering signal offsets where the interfering
signal falls completely within the inter *Base Station RF Bandwidth*
gap.

The wanted signal and interfering signal centre frequency is specified
in table 6.7.4.1‑1.

7 Conducted receiver characteristics
====================================

7.1 General
-----------

Unless otherwise stated, the receiver characteristics are specified at
the AAS BS *TAB connector* with full complement of transceivers for the
configuration in normal operating condition. For FDD operation the
requirements in clause 7 shall be met with the transmitter unit(s) on.

NOTE 1: In normal operating condition the BS in FDD operation is
configured to transmit and receive at the same time.

NOTE 2: In normal operating condition the BS in TDD operation is
configured to TX OFF power during *receive period*.

The manufacturer shall declare the minimum number of supported
geographical cells (i.e. geographical areas). The minimum number of
supported geographical cells (N~cells~) relates to the AAS BS setting
with minimum amount of cell splitting. The manufacturer shall also
declare *TAB connector RX min cell groups for this minimum number of
cells configuration*. Every *TAB connector* supporting reception in an
operating band shall map to one *TAB connector* RX min cell group
supporting the same. The mapping of *TAB connectors* to cells is
implementation dependent.

The number of active receiver units that are considered when calculating
the emission limit (N~RXU,counted~) for an AAS BS is calculated as
follows:

N~RXU,counted~ = *min(N~RXU,active~, 8* *× N~cells~)* for AAS BS in
*single RAT E-UTRA operation* and MSR AAS BS (excluding UTRA only MSR
AAS BS).

And

N~RXU,counted~ = *min(N~RXU,\ active~, 4* *×* *N~cells~)* for AAS BS in
*single RAT UTRA operation* and UTRA only MSR AAS BS.

Further:

N~RXU,countedpercell~ = *N~RXU,counted~ / N~cells~*

N~RXU,countedpercell~ is used for scaling the *basic limits* as
described in subclause 7.6.

NOTE 3: N~RXU,active~ is the number of actually active receiver units
and is independent to the declaration of N~cells~.

Any receiver requirement specified for NB-IoT in-band, NB-IoT guard
band, or standalone NB-IoT operation in 3GPP TS 36.104 \[4\] for E-UTRA
with NB-IoT (in-band or guard band) or for standalone NB-IoT, or in 3GPP
TS 37.104 \[5\] for E-UTRA with NB-IoT or standalone NB-IoT in *MSR
operation*, and referred in clause 7, is not applicable for AAS BS.

Any receiver requirement specified for Band 46 operation or for Band 49
operation in 3GPP TS 36.104 \[4\] for E-UTRA, or in 3GPP TS 37.104 \[5\]
for E-UTRA in *MSR operation*, and referred in clause 7, is not
applicable for AAS BS. The requirements for co-location blocking for
Band 46 or Band 49 are applicable for AAS BS.

7.4 Adjacent channel selectivity, general blocking, and narrowband blocking
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 7.4.1 General

The adjacent channel selectivity (ACS), general blocking and narrowband
blocking characteristics are measures of the receiver unit ability to
receive a wanted signal at its assigned channel at the *TAB connector*
in the presence of an unwanted interferer inside the operating band.

NOTE: For Single RAT requirements, the in-band selectivity
characteristics is referred to as \"adjacent channel selectivity\",
whereas for the MSR requirements, the corresponding property is referred
to as \"general blocking\" since the adjacent frequency range may not
carry a channel addressable from the interfered carrier.

The in-band blocking requirement applies from F~UL\_low~ - Δf~OOB~ to
F~UL\_high~ + Δf~OOB~, excluding the downlink frequency range of the FDD
*operating band*. The values of Δf~OOB~ are defined in table 7.4.1-1.

Table 7.4.1-1: Δf~OOB~ offset for operating bands

  *Operating band* characteristics                Δf~OOB~ \[MHz\]
  ----------------------------------------------- -----------------
  F~UL\_high~ -- F~UL\_low~ \< 100 MHz            20
  100 MHz ≤ F~UL\_high~ -- F~UL\_low~ ≤ 900 MHz   60

### 7.4.2 Minimum requirement for MSR operation

#### 7.4.2.1 General minimum requirement

For the general blocking requirement, the interfering signal shall be a
UTRA FDD signal as specified in 3GPP TS 37.104 \[9\], annex A.1 for a
UTRA, E-UTRA or NR (≤ 20 MHz) wanted signal. The interfering signal
shall be a 20 MHz E-UTRA signal for NR wanted signal channel bandwidth
greater than 20MHz.

The requirement is applicable outside the *Base Station RF Bandwidth* or
*Radio Bandwidth*. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to
the *Base Station RF Bandwidth* *edges* or *Radio Bandwidth* edges
applicable to each *TAB connector*.

For *TAB connector* supporting operation in *non-contiguous spectrum*,
the requirement applies in addition inside any *sub-block gap*, in case
the *sub-block gap* size is at least 15 MHz. The interfering signal
offset is defined relative to the *sub-block* edges inside the
*sub-block gap*.

For *multi-band TAB connectors*, the requirement applies in addition
inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* at those connectors, in case the gap
size is at least 15 MHz. The interfering signal offset is defined
relative to the *Base Station RF Bandwidth* *edges* inside the *Inter RF
Bandwidth gap*.

For the wanted and interfering signal coupled to the *TAB connector*,
using the parameters in tables 7.4.2.1‑1 and 7.4.2.1‑2, the following
requirements shall be met:

\- For any E-UTRA carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95 % of the
*maximum throughput* of the reference measurement channel defined in
3GPP TS 36.104 \[8\], subclause 7.2.1.

\- For any UTRA FDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0,001 for the
reference measurement channel defined in 3GPP TS 25.104 \[6\], subclause
7.2.1.

\- For any UTRA TDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0,001 for the
reference measurement channel defined in 3GPP TS 25.105 \[7\], subclause
7.2.1.2.

\- For any NR carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channel defined for *BS type
1-H* in TS 38.104 \[28\], subclause 7.2.2.For *multi-band TAB
connectors*, the requirement applies according to table 7.4.2.1-1 at
those connectors for the in-band blocking frequency ranges of each
supported operating band.

Table 7.4.2.1-2: Void

NOTE: The requirement in table 7.4.2.1-1 assumes that two operating
bands, where the *downlink operating band* (see subclause 4.5 in 3GPP TS
37.104 \[9\]) of one band would be within the in-band blocking region of
the other band, are not deployed in the same geographical area.

#### 7.4.2.2 General narrowband blocking minimum requirement

For the general narrowband blocking requirement, the interfering signal
shall be an E-UTRA 1RB signal as specified in 3GPP TS 37.104 \[9\],
annex A.3.

The requirement is applicable outside the *Base Station RF Bandwidth* or
*Radio Bandwidth*. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to
the *Base Station RF Bandwidth* *edges* or *Radio Bandwidth* edges.

For *TAB connectors* supporting operation in *non-contiguous spectrum*,
the requirement applies in addition inside any *sub-block gap*, in case
the *sub-block gap* size is at least 3 MHz. The interfering signal
offset is defined relative to the *sub-block* edges inside the
*sub-block gap*.

For *multi-band TAB connectors*, the requirement applies in addition
inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* at those connectors, in case the gap
size is at least 3 MHz. The interfering signal offset is defined
relative to the *Base Station RF Bandwidth* *edges* inside the *Inter RF
Bandwidth gap*.

For the wanted and interfering signal coupled to the *TAB connector*
using the parameters in table 7.4.2.2‑1, the following requirements
shall be met:

\- For any E-UTRA carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95 % of the
*maximum throughput* of the reference measurement channel defined in
3GPP TS 36.104 \[8\], subclause 7.2.1.

\- For any UTRA FDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0,001 for the
reference measurement channel defined in 3GPP TS 25.104 \[6\], subclause
7.2.1.

\- For any UTRA TDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0,001 for the
reference measurement channel defined in 3GPP TS 25.105 \[7\], subclause
7.2.1.2.

\- For any NR carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channel defined for *BS type
1-H* in TS 38.104 \[28\], subclause 7.2.2.

#### 7.4.2.3 Additional BC3 blocking minimum requirement

This additional requirement only applies for BS operating in the same
geographical area as UTRA TDD.

For the additional BC3 blocking requirement, the interfering signal is a
1,28 Mcps UTRA TDD signal as specified in 3GPP TS 37.104 \[9\], annex
A.2.

The requirement is always applicable outside the *Base Station RF
Bandwidth* or *Radio Bandwidth*. The interfering signal offset is
defined relative to the *Base Station RF Bandwidth* *edges* or *Radio
Bandwidth* edges.

For *multi-band TAB connectors*, the requirement applies in addition
inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* at those connectors, in case the gap
size is at least 4.8 MHz. The interfering signal offset is defined
relative to the *Base Station RF Bandwidth* *edges* inside the *Inter RF
Bandwidth gap*.

For the wanted and interfering signal coupled to the *TAB connector*,
using the parameters in table 7.4.2.3‑1, the following requirements
shall be met:

\- For any E-UTRA TDD carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95 % of the
*maximum throughput* of the reference measurement channel defined in
3GPP TS 36.104 \[8\], subclause 7.2.1.

\- For any UTRA TDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0,001 for the
reference measurement channel defined in 3GPP TS 25.105 \[7\], subclause
7.2.1.2.

using the parameters in table 7.5.2.1-1, the following requirements
shall be met:

\- For any E-UTRA carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95 % of the
*maximum throughput* of the reference measurement channel defined in
3GPP TS 36.104 \[8\], subclause 7.2.1.

\- For any UTRA FDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0,001 for the

specified in 3GPP TS 25.105 \[7\], subclause 7.5.1.2.

The single RAT UTRA 1,28 Mcps TDD AAS BS of Local Area BS class may
optionally fulfil minimum requirements for co-location blocking
specified in 3GPP TS 25.105 \[7\], subclause 7.5.1.2.

### 7.5.4 Minimum requirement for single RAT E-UTRA operation

#### 7.5.4.1 General minimum requirement 

For E-UTRA, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of
the reference measurement channel, with a wanted and an interfering
signal coupled to BS antenna input using the parameters in Tables
7.5.4.1-1, 7.5.4.1-2, 7.5.4.1-3 and 7.5.4.1-4. The reference measurement
channel is defined in 3GPP TS 36.104 \[8\], subclause 7.2.1.

The blocking requirement is applicable outside the Base Station RF
Bandwidth or Radio Bandwidth. The interfering signal offset is defined
relative to the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges or Radio Bandwidth
edges.

For a BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum within any operating band,
the blocking requirement applies in addition inside any sub-block gap,
in case the sub-block gap size is at least as wide as twice the
interfering signal minimum offset in Table 7.5.4.1-4. The interfering
signal offset is defined relative to the sub-block edges inside the
sub-block gap.

For a BS capable of multi-band operation, the requirement in the in-band
blocking frequency ranges applies for each supported operating band. The
requirement applies in addition inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap, in
case the Inter RF Bandwidth gap size is at least as wide as twice the
interfering signal minimum offset in Table 7.5.4.1-4.

For a BS capable of multi-band operation, the requirement in the
out-of-band blocking frequency ranges apply for each operating band,
with the exception that the in-band blocking frequency ranges of all
supported operating bands according to Tables 7.5.4.1-1, 7.5.4.1-2 and
7.5.4.1-3 shall be excluded from the out-of-band blocking requirement.

#### 7.5.4.2 Co-location minimum requirement

The single RAT E-UTRA AAS BS of Wide Area BS class may optionally fulfil
minimum requirements for co-location blocking specified in 3GPP TS
36.104 \[8\], subclause 7.6.2.

The single RAT E-UTRA AAS BS of Medium Range BS class may optionally
fulfil minimum requirements for co-location blocking specified in 3GPP
TS 36.104 \[8\], subclause 7.6.2.

The single RAT E-UTRA AAS BS of Local Area BS class may optionally
fulfil minimum requirements for co-location blocking specified in 3GPP
TS 36.104 \[8\], subclause 7.6.2.

7.6 Receiver spurious emissions
-------------------------------

### 7.6.1 General

The receiver spurious emissions power is the power of emissions
generated or amplified in a receiver unit that appear at the *TAB
connector*. The requirements apply to all AAS BS with separate RX and TX
*TAB connectors*.

NOTE: In this case for FDD AAS BS the test is performed when both TX and
RX are ON, with the TX *TAB connector* terminated.

For a *TAB connector* supporting both RX and TX in TDD, the requirements
apply during the *transmitter OFF period*. For a *TAB connector*
supporting both RX and TX in FDD, the receiver spurious requirements are
superseded by the TX spurious requirements in subclause 6.6.6.

For RX only *multi-band TAB connector(s)*, the RX spurious emissions
requirements are subject to exclusion zones in each supported operating
band. For *multi-band TAB connector(s)* that both transmit and receive
in operating band supporting TDD, RX spurious emissions requirements are
applicable during the TX OFF period, and are subject to exclusion zones
in each supported operating band. *The unwanted emission level limit of
a TAB connector RX min cell group is in general defined by the unwanted
emission basic limit which is the same as the corresponding applicable
non-AAS BS per transmitter requirement specified in* 3GPP TS 25.104
\[2\], 3GPP TS 25.105 \[3\], 3GPP TS 36.104 \[4\] or 3GPP TS 37.104
\[5\]*, and its scaling by* N~RXU,countedpercell~. The *basic limits*
and corresponding scaling are defined in each relevant subclause. The
receiver spurious emission requirements are applied per the *TAB
connector RX min cell groups for all the configurations supported by the
AAS BS.*

The general MSR RX spurious emission *basic limit*s are provided in
table 7.6.2.1-1.

The RX spurious emissions requirements for an MSR AAS BS are that for
each applicable *basic limit* specified in table 7.6.2.1-1 for each *TAB
connector RX min cell group,* the power sum of emissions at the *TAB
connectors* of the *TAB connector RX min cell group* shall not exceed an
AAS BS limit specified as the *basic limit* + X, where X =
10log~10~(N~RXU,countedpercell~), unless stated differently in regional
regulation.

In addition to the *basic limit*s in table 7.6.2.1-1, additional
spurious emissions requirements in 3GPP TS 37.104 \[9\],
subclause 6.6.1.3 form *basic limit*s for additional receiver spurious
emission requirements.

In case of FDD BS (for BC1 and BC2), the levels specified for Protection
of the BS receivers of own or different BS in 3GPP TS 37.104 \[9\],
subclause 6.6.1.2 form basic levels for additional receiver spurious
emission requirements.

In addition, the requirements for co-location with other base stations
specified in 3GPP TS 37.104 \[9\], subclause 6.6.1.4 may also form basic
levels for co-location spurious emission requirements.

NOTE: Conformance to the *AAS BS receiver* spurious emissions
requirement can be demonstrated by meeting at least one of the following
criteria as determined by the manufacturer:

> 1\) The sum of the spurious emissions power measured on each *TAB
> connector* in the *TAB connector RX min cell group* shall be less than
> or equal to the AAS BS limit as defined above for the respective
> frequency span.
>
> Or
>
> 2\) The spurious emissions power at each *TAB connector* shall be less
> than or equal to the AAS BS limit as defined above for the respective
> frequency span, scaled by -10log~10~(*n*), where *n* is the number of
> *TAB connectors* in the *TAB connector RX min cell group*.

### 7.6.3 Minimum requirement for single RAT UTRA operation

The single RAT UTRA FDD wide area, medium range area and local area RX
spurious emissions *basic limit*s are the same as those specified in
3GPP TS 25.104 \[6\], subclause 7.7.1.

The single RAT UTRA TDD wide area and local area RX spurious emissions
*basic limit*s are the same as those specified in 3GPP TS 25.105 \[7\],
subclause 7.7.1.2.

The RX spurious emissions requirements for a single RAT UTRA AAS BS are
that for each applicable *basic limit* as specified in 3GPP TS 25.104
\[6\] or 3GPP TS 25.105 \[7\], for each *TAB connector RX min cell
group,* the power sum of emissions at the *TAB connectors* of the *TAB
connector RX min cell group* shall not exceed an AAS BS limit specified
as the *basic limit* + X, where X = 10log~10~(N~RXU,countedpercell~),
unless stated differently in regional regulation.

NOTE: Conformance to the *AAS BS receiver* spurious emissions
requirement can be demonstrated by meeting at least one of the following
criteria as determined by the manufacturer:

> 1\) The sum of the spurious emissions power measured on each *TAB
> connector* in the *TAB connector RX min cell group* shall be less than
> or equal to the AAS BS limit as defined above for the respective

> 2\) The spurious emissions power at each *TAB connector* shall be less
> than or equal to the AAS BS limit as defined above for the respective
> frequency span, scaled by -10log~10~(*n*), where *n* is the number of
> *TAB connectors* in the *TAB connector RX min cell group*.

### 7.6.4 Minimum requirement for single RAT E-UTRA operation

The single RAT E-UTRA wide area, medium range area and local area RX
spurious emissions *basic limit*s are the same as those specified in
3GPP TS 36.104 \[8\], subclause 7.7.1 with the exception that the
frequency range around the band edge (within which the requirement is
not applicable) is Δf~OBUE~.

The RX spurious emissions requirements for a single RAT E-UTRA AAS BS
are that for each applicable *basic limit* specified in 3GPP TS 36.104
\[4\] for each *TAB connector RX min cell group*, the power sum of
emissions at the *TAB connectors* of the *TAB connector RX min cell
group* shall not exceed an AAS limit specified as the *basic limit* + X,
where X = 10log~10~(N~RXU,countedpercell~), unless stated differently in
regional regulation.

NOTE: Conformance to the *AAS BS receiver* spurious emissions
requirement can be demonstrated by meeting at least one of the following
criteria as determined by the manufacturer:

> 1\) The sum of the emissions power measured on each *TAB connector* in
> the *TAB connector RX min cell group* shall be less than or equal to
> the AAS BS limit as defined above for the respective frequency span.
>
> Or
>
> 2\) The spurious emission power at each *TAB connector* shall be less
> than or equal to the AAS BS limit as defined above for the respective
> frequency span, scaled by -10log~10~(*n*), where *n* is the number of
> *TAB connectors* in the *TAB connector RX min cell group*.

7.7 Receiver intermodulation
----------------------------

### 7.7.1 General

Third and higher order mixing of the two interfering RF signals can
produce an interfering signal in the band of the desired channel.
Intermodulation response rejection is a measure of the capability of the
receiver unit to receive a wanted signal on its assigned channel
frequency in the presence of two interfering signals which have a
specific frequency relationship to the wanted signal. The requirement
applies per *TAB connector.*

### 7.7.2 Minimum requirement for MSR operation

#### 7.7.2.1 General intermodulation minimum requirement

Interfering signals shall be a CW signal and an E-UTRA or UTRA signal as
specified in 3GPP TS 37.104 \[9\], annex A.

The requirement is applicable outside the *Base Station RF Bandwidth* or
*Radio Bandwidth*. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to
the *Base Station RF Bandwidth* *edges* or *Radio Bandwidth* edges.

For *multi-band TAB connectors*, the requirement applies in addition
inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* at those connectors, in case the gap
size is at least twice as wide as the UTRA/E-UTRA interfering signal
centre frequency offset from the *Base Station RF Bandwidth* *edge*. The
interfering signal offset is defined relative to the *Base Station RF
Bandwidth* *edges* inside the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*.

For the wanted signal at the assigned channel frequency and two
interfering signals coupled to the *TAB connector*, using the parameters
in tables 7.7.2.1-1 and 7.7.2.1-2, the following requirements shall be
met:

\- For any E-UTRA carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95 % of the
*maximum throughput* of the reference measurement channel defined in
3GPP TS 36.104 \[8\], subclause 7.2.1.

\- For any UTRA FDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0,001 for the
reference measurement channel defined in 3GPP TS 25.104 \[6\], subclause
7.2.1.

\- For any UTRA TDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0,001 for the
reference measurement channel defined in 3GPP TS 25.105 \[7\], subclause
7.2.1.2.

\- For any NR carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channel defined for *BS type
1-H* in TS 38.104 \[28\], subclause 7.2.2

#### 7.7.2.2 General narrowband intermodulation minimum requirement

Interfering signals shall be a CW signal and an E-UTRA 1RB signal as
specified in 3GPP TS 37.104 \[9\], annex A.

The requirement is applicable outside the *Base Station RF Bandwidth* or
*Radio Bandwidth*. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to
the *Base Station RF Bandwidth* *edges* or *Radio Bandwidth* edges.

For *TAB connector* supporting operation in *non-contiguous spectrum*
within each supported operating band, the requirement applies in
addition inside any *sub-block gap* in case the *sub-block gap* is at
least as wide as the *channel bandwidth* of the E-UTRA interfering
signal in table 7.7.2.2-2. The interfering signal offset is defined
relative to the *sub-block* edges inside the gap.

For *multi-band TAB connectors*, the requirement applies in addition
inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* at those connectors in case the gap
size is at least as wide as the E-UTRA interfering signal in table
7.7.2.2-2. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the
*Base Station RF Bandwidth* *edges* inside the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*.

For the wanted signal at the assigned channel frequency and two
interfering signals coupled to the *TAB connector*, using the parameters
in tables 7.7.2.2-1 and 7.7.2.2-2, the following requirements shall be
met:

\- For any E-UTRA carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95 % of the
*maximum throughput* of the reference measurement channel defined in
3GPP TS 36.104 \[8\], subclause 7.2.1.

\- For any UTRA FDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0,001 for the
reference measurement channel defined in 3GPP TS 25.104 \[6\], subclause
7.2.1.

\- For any UTRA TDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0,001 for the
reference measurement channel defined in 3GPP TS 25.105 \[7\], subclause
7.2.1.2.

\- For any NR carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channel defined for *BS type
1-H* in TS 38.104 \[28\], subclause 7.2.2

7.8 In-channel selectivity
--------------------------

### 7.8.1 General

In-channel selectivity (ICS) is a measure of the receiver unit ability
to receive a wanted signal at its assigned resource block locations in
the presence of an interfering signal received at a larger power
spectral density. In this condition a throughput requirement shall be
met for a specified reference measurement channel. The requirement
applies per *TAB connector*.

### 7.8.2 Minimum requirement for MSR operation

For E-UTRA, the minimum requirement for in-channel selectivity is
specified in subclause 7.8.4.

For NR, the minimum requirement for in-channel selectivity is specified
in 3GPP TS 38.104 \[28\] for *BS type 1-H* in subclause 7.8.2.

This requirement is not applicable for UTRA operation.

### 7.8.3 Minimum requirement for single RAT UTRA operation

This requirement is not applicable for UTRA BS.

### 7.8.4 Minimum requirement for single RAT E-UTRA operation

The single RAT E-UTRA AAS BS of Wide Area BS class shall fulfil minimum
requirements for in-channel selectivity specified in 3GPP TS 36.104
\[8\], subclause 7.4.1.

36.104 \[8\], subclause 7.4.1.

The single RAT E-UTRA AAS BS of Local Area BS class shall fulfil minimum
requirements for in-channel selectivity specified in 3GPP TS 36.104
\[8\], subclause 7.4.1.

The interfering signal shall be an E-UTRA signal as specified in 3GPP TS
36.104 \[8\], annex C and shall be time aligned with the wanted signal.

8 Performance requirements
==========================

8.1 General
-----------

Performance requirements specify the ability of the AAS BS to correctly
demodulate signals in various conditions and configurations.

The demodulation requirements for an AAS BS are the same as *non-AAS BS*
demodulation requirements specified for:

\- *Single RAT UTRA operation* in TS 25.104 \[9\] clause 8 for FDD
operation, and in TS 25.105 \[10\] clause 8 for TDD operation,

\- *Single RAT E-UTRA operation* in TS 36.104 \[11\], subclauses 8.2 --
8.4 and 8.6 -- 8.7.

### 8.1.1 UTRA operation

Performance requirements for *single RAT UTRA operation* in FDD are
specified for the measurement channels defined in 3GPP TS 25.104 \[2\]
and 3GPP TS 25.105 \[3\]. The requirements only apply to those
measurement channels that are supported by AAS BS. For FRC8 in 3GPP TS
25.104 \[2\] the non E-DPCCH boosting and E-DPCCH boosting requirement
only apply for the option supported by the AAS BS. The performance
requirements for the high speed train scenarios defined in 3GPP
TS 25.104 \[2\] and 3GPP TS 25.105 \[3\] are optional.

Unless stated otherwise, performance requirements apply for a single
cell only. Performance requirements for an AAS BS supporting UTRA FDD
DC-HSUPA or DB-DC-HSUPA and UTRA TDD MC-HSUPA are defined in terms of
single carrier requirements. For FDD operation the requirements in
clause 8 shall be met with the transmitter unit(s) associated with the
*TAB connectors(s)* in the operating band ON.

NOTE: In normal operating conditions the *TAB connectors(s)* in UTRA FDD
operation are configured to transmit and receive at the same time. The
transmitter unit(s) associated with the *TAB connectors* may be OFF for
some of the tests as specified in TS 37.145-1 \[29\] and TS 37.145-2
\[30\].

In the referred UTRA specifications and in this clause, the term BS with
RX diversity refers to performance requirements for two *demodulation
branches*, and BS without RX diversity refers to performance
requirements for one *demodulation branch*.

For AAS BS with RX diversity, only the BS performance requirements with
RX diversity apply, the required E~b~/N~0~ for UTRA FDD and Î~or~/I~oc~
for UTRA TDD shall be applied separately for each *demodulation branch*.

For AAS BS without RX diversity, only the BS performance requirements
without RX diversity apply. The required E~b~/N~0~ for UTRA FDD and
Î~or~/I~oc~ for UTRA TDD shall be applied for each AAS BS *demodulation
branch*.

The E~b~/N~0~ used for UTRA FDD is defined as:

Where:

is the received total energy of DPDCH, DPCCH, S-DPCCH, HS-DPCCH,
E-DPDCH, S-E-DPDCH, E-DPCCH and S-E-DPCCH per PN chip per *demodulation
branch* from all branches

is the total one-sided noise power spectral density due to all noise
sources

is the number of chips per frame

is the number of information bits in DTCH excluding CRC bits per frame

### 8.1.2 E-UTRA operation

Performance requirements for the AAS BS are specified for the fixed
reference channels (FRC) and propagation conditions defined in 3GPP TS
36.104 \[8\] annex A and annex B, respectively. The requirements only
apply to those FRCs that are supported by the AAS BS.

Unless stated otherwise, performance requirements apply for a single
carrier only. Performance requirements for an AAS BS E-UTRA supporting
*carrier aggregation* are defined in terms of single carrier
requirements. For FDD operation the requirements shall be met with the
transmitter unit(s) associated with the *TAB connectors(s)* in the
operating band ON.

NOTE: In normal operating conditions *TAB connectors* in FDD operation
are configured to transmit and receive at the same time. The transmitter
unit(s) associated with the *TAB connectors* may be OFF for some of the
tests as specified in TS 37.145-1 \[29\] and TS 37.145-2 \[30\].

In the referred E-UTRA specification, the term \"RX antennas\" refers to
*demodulation branches* (and not physical antennas).

The SNR used in this clause is specified based on a single carrier and
defined as:

SNR = S / N

Where:

S is the total signal energy in the subframe on a single *TAB
connector*.

N is the noise energy in a bandwidth corresponding to the *transmission
bandwidth* over the duration of a subframe.

For *enhanced performance requirements type A* and type B, the SINR used
in this clause is specified based on a single carrier and defined as:

Where:

is the total signal energy of one intra-cell UE in the subframe on a
single *TAB connector*.

is the summation of the received energy of the strongest inter-cell
interferers explicitly defined in a test procedure plus the white noise
energy *N*, in a bandwidth corresponding to the *transmission bandwidth*
over the duration of a subframe on a single *TAB connector*. The
respective energy of each inter-cell interferer relative to is defined
by its associated DIP value

8.2 Minimum requirements for MSR operation
------------------------------------------

For *single RAT UTRA operation*, minimum requirements for demodulation
performance are specified in subclause 8.3.

For *single RAT E-UTRA operation*, minimum requirements for demodulation
performance are specified in subclause 8.4.

8.3 Minimum requirements for UTRA operation
-------------------------------------------

The *single RAT UTRA operation* in FDD shall fulfil all mandatory BS
demodulation performance requirements specified in subclauses 8.2 to
8.12 of 3GPP TS 25.104 \[6\].

The *single RAT UTRA operation* in TDD shall fulfil all mandatory BS
demodulation performance requirements specified in subclauses 8.2 to 8.5
of 3GPP TS 25.105 \[7\].

In the referred UTRA specifications, the term BS with RX diversity
refers to performance requirements for two *demodulation branches*, and
BS without RX diversity refers to performance requirements for one
*demodulation branch*.

8.4 Minimum requirements for E-UTRA operation
---------------------------------------------

The *single RAT E-UTRA operation* shall fulfil all mandatory BS
demodulation performance requirements specified in subclauses 8.2 to 8.4
of 3GPP TS 36.104 \[8\].

In the referred E-UTRA specification, the term \"RX antennas\" refers to
*demodulation branches* (i.e. not physical antennas).

9 Radiated transmitter characteristics
======================================

9.1 General
-----------

Radiated transmitter characteristics requirements apply on the AAS BS
including all its functional components active and for all foreseen
modes of operation of the AAS BS unless otherwise stated.

Unless otherwise stated, the transmitter characteristics are specified
with a full complement of transceiver units for the configuration in
normal operating conditions.

*The manufacturer shall declare the minimum number of supported
geographical cells (i.e. geographical areas). The minimum number of
supported geographical cells (N~cells~) relates to the AAS BS setting
with the minimum amount of cell splitting supported.*

*OTA AAS BS transmitter requirements apply per geographical cell .*

*Radiated emissions with requirements described as TRP are defined as
follows:*

,where P~D~(r,θ,ϕ) is the power density in W/m^2^ at a distance *r* of
two orthogonal polarizations.

9.2 Radiated transmit power
---------------------------

### 9.2.1 General

An AAS BS is declared to support one or more beams. Radiated transmit
power is defined as the EIRP level for a declared beam at a specific
*beam peak direction*.

For each beam, the requirement is based on declaration of a beam
identity, *reference beam direction pair*, *beamwidth*, *rated beam
EIRP*, *OTA peak directions set*, the *beam direction pairs* at the
maximum steering directions and their associated *rated beam EIRP* and
*beamwidth(s)*.

For a declared beam and *beam direction pair*, the *rated beam EIRP*
level is the maximum power that the base station is declared to radiate
at the associated *beam peak direction* during the *transmitter ON
period*.

For each *beam peak direction* associated with a *beam direction pair*
within the *OTA peak directions set*, a specific *rated beam EIRP* level
may be claimed. Any claimed value shall be met within the accuracy
requirement as described below. *Rated beam EIRP* is only required to be
declared for the *beam direction pairs* subject to conformance testing
as detailed in TS 37.145-2 \[30\].

NOTE 1: *OTA peak directions set* is set of *beam peak directions* for
which the EIRP accuracy requirement is intended to be met. The *beam
peak directions* are related to a corresponding contiguous range or
discrete list of *beam centre directions* by the *beam direction pairs*
included in the set.

NOTE 2: A *beam direction pair* is data set consisting of the *beam
centre direction* and the related *beam peak direction.*

NOTE 3: A declared EIRP value is a value provided by the manufacturer
for verification according to the conformance specification declaration
requirements, whereas a claimed EIRP value is provided by the
manufacturer to the equipment user for normal operation of the equipment
and is not subject to formal conformance testing.

### 9.2.2 Minimum requirement for MSR operation

For each declared beam, in normal conditions, for any specific *beam
peak direction* associated with a *beam direction pair* within the *OTA
peak directions set*, a manufacturer claimed EIRP level in the
corresponding *beam peak direction* shall be achievable to within +2,2
dB and -2,2 dB of the claimed value.

For each declared beam, in extreme conditions, for any specific *beam
peak direction* associated with a *beam direction pair* within the *OTA
peak directions set*, a manufacturer claimed EIRP level in the
corresponding *beam peak direction* shall be achievable to within +2,7
dB and -2,7 dB of the claimed value.

In certain regions, the minimum requirement for normal conditions may
apply also for some conditions outside the range of conditions defined
as normal.

### 9.2.3 Minimum requirement for single RAT UTRA operation

The minimum requirement for UTRA FDD and UTRA TDD 1,28Mcps option

### 9.6.3 OTA Time alignment error

#### 9.6.3.1 General

This requirement applies to frame timing in:

\- UTRA single/multi-carrier transmissions and their combinations with
MIMO or TX diversity.

\- E-UTRA single/multi-carrier transmissions and their combinations with
MIMO or TX diversity.

\- E-UTRA *carrier aggregation*, with or without MIMO or TX diversity.

\- NR single/multi-carrier transmissions, and their combinations with
MIMO.

\- NR Carrier Aggregation, with or without MIMO.

Frames of the WCDMA/LTE/NR signals present in the radiated domain are
not perfectly aligned in time. In relation to each other, the RF signals
present in the radiated domain may experience certain timing
differences.

For a specific set of signals/transmitter configuration/transmission
mode, the OTA Time Alignment Error (OTA TAE) is defined as the largest
timing difference between any two different E-UTRA signals or any two
different UTRA signals or any two different NR signals belonging to
different *reference symbols (e.g. CRS0 or CRS1 for E-UTRA, PDSCH DMRS
on ports 1000 and 1001 for NR)* in the radiated domain. The OTA time
alignment error requirement is defined as a *single direction
requirement* at the RIB and shall be met within the *OTA coverage
range*.

#### 9.6.3.2 Minimum requirement for MSR operation 

The minimum requirement for a UTRA time alignment error is the same as
defined in subclause 9.6.3.3.

The minimum requirement for an E-UTRA time alignment error is the same
as defined in subclause 9.6.3.4.

The minimum requirement for an NR time alignment error is the same as
that for *BS type 1-O* defined in 3GPP TS 38.104 \[28\] subclause
9.6.3.2.

#### 9.6.3.3 Minimum requirement for single RAT UTRA operation

This requirement applies to frame timing in Tx diversity, MIMO
transmission, DC-HSDPA, DB-DC-HSDPA, 4C-HSDPA, NC-4C-HSDPA, 8C-HSDPA and
their combinations.

The OTA TAE between any two reference symbols shall not exceed the
specified minimum requirements described in 3GPP TS 25.104 \[6\],
subclause 6.8.4.1.

#### 9.6.3.4 Minimum requirement for single RAT E-UTRA operation

This requirement applies to frame timing in TX diversity, MIMO
transmission, *carrier aggregation* and their combinations.

The OTA TAE between any two reference symbols shall not exceed the
specified minimum requirements described in 3GPP TS 36.104 \[8\],
subclause 6.5.3.1.

### 9.6.4 OTA Modulation quality

#### 9.6.4.1 General

OTA modulation quality is defined by the difference between the measured
carrier signal and a reference signal. Modulation quality can be
expressed e.g. as Peak Code Domain Error (PCDE) or Relative Code Domain
Error (RCDE) or Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) for UTRA and Error Vector
Magnitude (EVM) for E-UTRA.

The OTA modulation quality requirement is defined as a *single direction
requirement* at the RIB and shall be met within the *OTA coverage
range*.

#### 9.6.4.2 Minimum requirement for MSR operation 

The minimum requirement for a UTRA modulation quality are defined in
subclause 9.6.4.3.

The minimum requirement for an E-UTRA modulation quality are defined in
subclause 9.6.4.4.

The minimum requirement for an NR modulation quality is the same as that
for *BS type 1-O* defined in 3GPP TS 38.104 \[28\] in subclause 9.6.2.2.

#### 9.6.4.3 Minimum requirement for single RAT UTRA operation

The Error Vector Magnitude is a measure of the difference between the
ideal waveform and the measured waveform. This difference is called the
error vector. Both waveforms pass through a matched Root Raised Cosine
filter to the considered chip rate and roll-off α=0.22. Both waveforms
are then further modified by selecting the frequency, absolute phase,
absolute amplitude and chip clock timing to minimize the error vector.
The EVM result is defined as the square root of the ratio of the mean
error vector power to the mean reference power expressed as a
percentage.

For UTRA FDD the measurement interval is one timeslot as defined by the
C-PICH (when present) otherwise the measurement interval is one timeslot
starting with the beginning of the SCH. The requirement is valid over
the total power dynamic range as specified in subclause 9.4.4. The
minimum requirements are the same as those in 3GPP TS 25.104 \[6\],
subclause 6.8.2.1.

For UTRA FDD the Peak Code Domain Error is computed by projecting the
error vector onto the code domain at a specified spreading factor. The
Code Domain Error for every code in the domain is defined as the ratio
of the mean power of the projection onto that code, to the mean power of
the composite ideal waveform. This ratio is expressed in dB. The Peak
Code Domain Error is defined as the maximum value for the Code Domain
Error for all codes. The measurement interval is one timeslot as defined
by the C-PICH (when present) otherwise the measurement interval is one
timeslot starting with the beginning of the SCH. The minimum
requirements are the same as those in 3GPP TS 25.104 \[6\], subclause
6.8.3.1.

For UTRA FDD the Relative Code Domain Error is computed by projecting
the error vector onto the code domain at a specified spreading factor.
Only the active code channels in the composite ideal waveform are
considered for this requirement. The Relative Code Domain Error for
every active code is defined as the ratio of the mean power of the error
projection onto that code, to the mean power of the active code in the
composite ideal waveform. This ratio is expressed in dB. The measurement
interval is one frame. The minimum requirements are the same as those in
3GPP TS 25.104 \[6\], subclause 6.8.5.1.

The requirement for Relative Code Domain Error is only applicable for
64QAM modulated codes.

#### 9.6.4.4 Minimum requirement for single RAT E-UTRA operation

For E-UTRA, the minimum requirement for modulation quality, EVM, is
specified in 3GPP TS 36.104 \[8\], subclause 6.5.2.

### 9.6.5 OTA Transmit pulse shape filter

#### 9.6.5.1 General

Transmit pulse shape filter for *single RAT UTRA operation* in FDD and
for *MSR operation* in UTRA FDD is defined in 3GPP TS 25.104 \[6\]
subclause 6.8.1.

Transmit pulse shape filter is not defined for a *single RAT E-UTRA
operation*, nor for *MSR operation* using E-UTRA and/or NR.

9.7 OTA Unwanted Emissions
--------------------------

### 9.7.1 General

Unwanted emissions consist of so-called out-of-band emissions and
spurious emissions according to ITU definitions 3GPP TS 25.331 \[16\].
In ITU terminology, out of band emissions are unwanted emissions
immediately outside the *channel bandwidth* resulting from the
modulation process and non-linearity in the transmitter but excluding
spurious emissions. Spurious emissions are emissions which are caused by
unwanted transmitter effects such as harmonics emission, parasitic
emission, intermodulation products and frequency conversion products,
but exclude out of band emissions.

OTA unwanted emissions for *OTA AAS BS* in *single RAT E-UTRA operation*
and *MSR operation* using E-UTRA consist of an OTA operating band
unwanted emissions requirement and OTA spurious emissions requirement.
OTA operating band unwanted emissions requirement defines limits for
emissions in each supported *downlink operating band* plus the frequency
ranges Δf~OBUE~ above and Δf~OBUE~ below each band, where Δf~OBUE~ is
the maximum offset of the operating band unwanted emission mask from the
operating band edge. Emissions outside of this frequency range are
limited by OTA spurious emissions requirement.

The values of Δf~OBUE~ are defined for *OTA AAS BS* for E-UTRA and UTRA
operating bands in Table 9.7.1-1.

Table 9.7.1-1: Maximum offset of OBUE outside the downlink *operating
band*

  **BS type**    **Operating band characteristics**              **Δf~OBUE~ \[MHz\]**
  -------------- ----------------------------------------------- ----------------------
  *OTA AAS BS*   F~DL\_high~ -- F~DL\_low~ \< 100 MHz            10
                 100 MHz ≤ F~DL\_high~ -- F~DL\_low~ ≤ 900 MHz   40

OTA unwanted emissions for *OTA AAS BS* in *single UTRA operation* and
*MSR operation* using UTRA consist of OTA spectrum emission mask
requirement and OTA spurious emissions requirement.

NOTE: for definitions of conducted unwanted emissions requirements refer
to clause 6.6

The unwanted emission requirements are applied per cell for all the
configurations supported by *OTA AAS BS*. Requirements for OTA unwanted
emissions are captured using TRP, *single direction requirements* or
co-location requirements as described per requirement.

There is in addition a requirement for occupied bandwidth and an ACLR
requirement.

### 9.7.2 OTA occupied bandwidth

#### 9.7.2.1 General

The OTA occupied bandwidth is the width of a frequency band such that,
below the lower and above the upper frequency limits, the mean powers
emitted are each equal to a specified percentage β/2 of the total mean
transmitted power. See also recommendation ITU-R SM.328 \[17\].

The value of β/2 shall be taken as 0.5%.

The OTA occupied bandwidth requirement applies during the *transmitter
ON period* for a single transmitted carrier. The minimum requirement
below may be applied regionally. There may also be regional requirements
to declare the OTA occupied bandwidth according to the definition in the
present clause.

The OTA occupied bandwidth is defined as a *single direction
requirement* and shall be met in the manufacturer\'s declared *OTA
coverage range* at the RIB.

#### 9.7.2.2 Minimum requirement for MSR operation

\[8\], subclause 6.6.1.

### 9.7.3 OTA Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio

#### 9.7.3.1 General

filtered mean power centred on the assigned channel frequency to the
filtered mean power centred on an adjacent channel frequency. The
measured power is TRP.

#### 9.7.3.2 Minimum requirement for MSR operation

For AAS BS in *MSR operation* using E-UTRA, the OTA ACLR limits for AAS
BS are the same as those specified in 3GPP TS 37.104 \[9\] subclauses

> subclause for the respective frequency span, by -10log~10~(*4*)

##### 9.7.4.3.2 Minimum requirements for single RAT UTRA FDD operation

The minimum requirement is specified in table\'s 9.7.4.3.2-1 to
9.7.3.4.2-10 for the appropriate P~max,c,TRP~, where:

\- ∆f is the separation between the carrier frequency and the nominal
-3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to the carrier frequency.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the carrier frequency and the
centre of the measurement filter;

\- f\_offset~max~ is either 12.5 MHz or the offset to the UMTS Tx band
edge as defined in clause 5.2, whichever is the greater.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

Inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gaps* with Wgap \< 2×Δf~OBUE~ for a
*multi-band RIB*, emissions shall not exceed the cumulative sum of the
*minimum requirements* specified at the *Base Station RF Bandwidth
edges* on each side of the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*. The *minimum
requirements* for *Base Station RF Bandwidth edge* is specified in
tables 9.7.3.4.2-1 to 9.7.3.4.2-10 below, where in this case:

\- ∆f is equal to 2.5MHz plus the separation between the *Base Station

For a *multi-band RIB*, the operating band unwanted emission minimum
requirements apply also in a supported operating band without any
carrier transmitted, in the case where there are carrier(s) transmitted
in another supported operating band. In this case, no cumulative limit
is applied in the *inter-band gap* between a supported *downlink
operating band* with carrier(s) transmitted and a supported *downlink
operating band* without any carrier transmitted and

\- In case the *inter-band gap* between a downlink band with carrier(s)
transmitted and a downlink band without any carrier transmitted is less
than 2×Δf~OBUE~ , f\_offset~max~ shall be the offset to the frequency
Δf~OBUE~ outside the outermost edges of the two *downlink operating
band*s and the operating band unwanted emission limit of the band where
there are carriers transmitted, as defined in the tables of the present

\- In other cases, the operating band unwanted emission limit of the
band where there are carriers transmitted, as defined in the tables of
the present subclause for the largest frequency offset (∆f~max~), shall

transmitted.

Inside any *sub-block gap* for a RIB operating in *non-contiguous
spectrum*, emissions shall not exceed the cumulative sum of the *minimum
requirements* specified for the adjacent sub blocks on each side of the
*sub-block gap*. The *minimum requirement* for each sub block is

case:

\- ∆f is equal to 2.5MHz plus the separation between the sub block edge
frequency and the nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to
the sub block edge.

\- f\_offset is equal to 2.5MHz plus the separation between the sub
block edge frequency and the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is equal to the *sub-block gap* bandwidth minus half
of the bandwidth of the measuring filter plus 2.5MHz.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

In certain regions, the following *basic limit* may apply to RIB
operating in Band XXXII within 1452-1492 MHz for the protection of
services in spectrum adjacent to the frequency range 1452-1492 MHz. The
level of emissions, measured on centre frequencies F~filter~ with filter
bandwidth according to table 9.7.4.3.2-10, shall not exceed the maximum
emission TRP limits in the table. This requirement applies in the
frequency range 1429-1518 MHz even though part of the range falls in the
spurious domain.

#### 9.7.4.4 Minimum requirement for single RAT E-UTRA operation

There is no spectrum emission mask requirement for a single RAT E-UTRA
AAS BS.

### 9.7.5 OTA Operating band unwanted emission 

#### 9.7.5.1 General

Unless otherwise stated, for E-UTRA single band and MSR the operating
band unwanted emission limits are defined from Δf~OBUE~ below the lowest
frequency of each supported *downlink operating band* to the lower *Base
Station RF Bandwidth edge* located at F~BW\ RF,low~ and from the upper
*Base Station RF Bandwidth edge* located at F~BW\ RF,high~ up to
Δf~OBUE~ above the highest frequency of each supported *downlink
operating band*. The values of Δf~OBUE~ are defined in table 9.7.1-1.

The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered
and for all transmission modes foreseen by the manufacturer\'s
specification.

The operating band unwanted emissions minimum requirements are quoted as
TRP per *RIB* unless otherwise stated.

The requirements shall apply whatever the type of RIB is considered
(single carrier or multi-carrier) and for all transmission modes
foreseen by the manufacturer\'s specification. In addition, for a RIB
operating in *non-contiguous spectrum*, the requirements apply inside
any *sub-block gap*. In addition, for a *multi-band RIB* the
requirements apply inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*.

The unwanted emission limits in the part of the *downlink operating
band* that falls in the spurious domain are consistent with ITU-R
Recommendation SM.329 \[14\].

Additional limits in clause 9.7.5.2.4.7 may apply outside OBUE frequency
domain.

Emissions shall use the minimum requirements specified in the tables
below, where:

\- ∆f is the separation between the channel edge frequency and the
nominal -3dB point of the measuring filter closest to the carrier
frequency.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the channel edge frequency and
the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is the offset to the frequency Δf~OBUE~ MHz outside
the *downlink operating band*.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

For a *multi-band RIB* inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gaps* with W~gap~
\< 2×Δf~OBUE~, emissions shall not exceed the cumulative sum of the
minimum requirements specified at the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edges*
on each side of the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*. The minimum requirement
for *Base Station RF Bandwidth edge* is specified in the subclause
9.7.5.4.2 to 9.7.5.4.7 below, where in this case:

\- ∆f is the separation between the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edge*
frequency and the nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to
the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edge*.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the *Base Station RF Bandwidth
edge* frequency and the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is equal to the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* minus half of
the bandwidth of the measuring filter.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

For *multi-band RIB*, the operating band unwanted emission limits apply
also in a supported operating band without any carrier transmitted, in
the case where there are carrier(s) transmitted in another supported
operating band. In this case, no cumulative limit is applied in the
*inter-band gap* between a supported *downlink operating band* with
carrier(s) transmitted and a supported *downlink operating band* without
any carrier transmitted and

\- In case the *inter-band gap* between a supported *downlink operating
band* with carrier(s) transmitted and a supported *downlink operating
band* without any carrier transmitted is less than 2×Δf~OBUE~,
f\_offset~max~ shall be the offset to the frequency Δf~OBUE~ MHz outside
the outermost edges of the two supported *downlink operating band*s and
the operating band unwanted emission limit of the band where there are
carriers transmitted, as defined in the tables of the present subclause,
shall apply across both downlink bands.

\- In other cases, the operating band unwanted emission limit of the
band where there are carriers transmitted, as defined in the tables of
the present subclause for the largest frequency offset (∆f~max~), shall
apply from Δf~OBUE~ MHz below the lowest frequency, up to Δf~OBUE~ MHz
above the highest frequency of the supported *downlink operating band*
without any carrier transmitted.

For a multicarrier E-UTRA RIB or a RIB configured for intra-band
contiguous or non-contiguous *carrier aggregation* the definitions above
apply to the lower edge of the carrier transmitted at the lowest carrier
frequency and the upper edge of the carrier transmitted at the highest
carrier frequency within a specified frequency band.

In addition, inside any *sub-block gap* for a RIB operating in
*non-contiguous spectrum*, emissions shall not exceed the cumulative sum
of the minimum requirements specified for the adjacent sub blocks on
each side of the *sub-block gap*. The minimum requirement for each sub
block is specified in the tables sub-cluase 9.7.5.4.2 to 9.7.5.4.7
below, where in this case:

\- ∆f is the separation between the sub block edge frequency and the
nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to the sub block
edge.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the sub block edge frequency and
the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is equal to the *sub-block gap* bandwidth minus half
of the bandwidth of the measuring filter.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

Δf~OBUE~ is defined in clause 6.6.1.

#### 9.7.5.2 Minimum requirement for MSR operation 

##### 9.7.5.2.1 General

The MSR operating band unwanted emission minimum requirements are given
in subclauses 9.7.5.2.2, 9.7.5.2.3, and 9.7.5.2.4.

##### 9.7.5.2.2 Minimum requirements for Band Categories 1 and 3

For an MSR RIB operating in BC1 or BC3 bands, the minimum requirements
are specified in tables 9.7.5.2.2-1 to 9.7.5.2.2-4, dependent on BS
class and output power.

Applicability of Wide Area operating band unwanted emission requirements
in tables 9.7.5.2.2-1, 9.7.5.2.2-1a and 9.7.5.2.2-1b is specified in
table 9.7.5.2.2-0.

NOTE 3: This frequency range ensures that the range of values of
f\_offset is continuous.

NOTE 4: As a general rule for the requirements in the present subclause,
the resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment should be equal to
the measurement bandwidth. However, to improve measurement accuracy,
sensitivity and efficiency, the resolution bandwidth may be smaller than
the measurement bandwidth. When the resolution bandwidth is smaller than
the measurement bandwidth, the result should be integrated over the
measurement bandwidth in order to obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth
of the measurement bandwidth.

NOTE 5: The requirement is not applicable when ∆f~max~ \< 10 MHz.

> The following notes are common to all subclauses in 9.7.5.2.3:

NOTE 9: This frequency range ensures that the range of values of
f\_offset is continuous.

NOTE 10: As a general rule for the requirements in the present
subclause, the resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment should be
equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to improve measurement
accuracy, sensitivity and efficiency, the resolution bandwidth may be
smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When the resolution bandwidth is
smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the result should be integrated
over the measurement bandwidth in order to obtain the equivalent noise
bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.

NOTE 11: The requirement is not applicable when ∆f~max~ \< 10 MHz.

NOTE 12: All limits in table 9.7.5.2.3‑1, table 9.7.5.2.3‑3,
table 9.7.5.2.3‑4 and table 9.7.5.2.3‑7 are identical to the
corresponding limits for Band Category 1 and 3.

##### 9.7.5.2.4 Additional requirements

###### 9.7.5.2.4.1 Limits in FCC Title 47

In addition to the AAS BS may have to comply with the applicable
emission limits established by FCC Title 47 \[8\], when deployed in
regions where those limits are applied, and under the conditions
declared by the manufacturer.

###### 9.7.5.2.4.2 Unsynchronized operation for BC3 

In certain regions, the following requirements may apply to a TDD AAS BS
operating in BC3 in the same geographic area and in the same operating
band as another TDD system without synchronisation. For this case the
emissions shall not exceed -52 dBm/MHz in each supported *downlink
operating band* except in:

> \- The frequency range from **Δf~OBUE~** below the lower *Base Station
> RF Bandwidth edge* to the frequency **Δf~OBUE~** above the upper *Base
> Station RF Bandwidth edge* of each supported band.

NOTE 1: Local or regional regulations may specify another excluded
frequency range, which may include frequencies where synchronised TDD
systems operate.

NOTE 2: TDD base stations that are synchronized and operating in BC3 can
transmit without these additional co-existence requirements.

###### 9.7.5.2.4.3 Protection of DTT 

In certain regions the following requirement may apply for protection of
DTT. For an AAS BS operating in Band 20, the level of emissions in the
band 470-790 MHz, measured in an 8 MHz filter bandwidth on centre
frequencies F~filter~ according to table 9.7.5.2.4.3-1, shall not exceed
the maximum emission TRP level shown in the table. This requirement
applies in the frequency range 470-790 MHz even though part of the range
falls in the spurious domain.

NOTE: The regional requirement is defined in terms of EIRP (effective
isotropic radiated power), which is dependent on both the BS emissions
and the deployment (including antenna gain and feeder loss). The method
outlined in annex B1 Indicates how the limit in table 5.2.4.3-1
demonstrates compliance to the regional requirement.

###### 9.7.5.2.4.5 Co-existence with RNSS/GPS services in North America

In regions where FCC regulation applies, requirements for protection of
GPS according to FCC Order DA 20-48 applies for operation in Band 24.
The following normative requirement covers the base station, to be used
together with other information about the site installation to verify
compliance with the requirement in FCC Order DA 20-48. The requirement
applies to BS operating in Band 24 to ensure that appropriate
interference protection is provided to the GPS. This requirement applies
in the frequency range 1541-1650 MHz even though part of the range falls
in the spurious domain.

The level of emissions in the 1541 -- 1650 MHz band, measured in
measurement bandwidth according to table 9.7.5.2.4.5-1 shall not exceed
the maximum TRP limits indicated in the table.

###### 9.7.5.2.4.7 Additional band 32, 50, 51, 74, 75 and 76 unwanted emissions

In certain regions, the following requirements may apply to BS operating
in Band 32 within 1452-1492 MHz, in Band 75 within 1432-1517 MHz and in
Band 76 within 1427-1432 MHz. The maximum level of operating band
unwanted emissions, measured as EIRP, on centre frequencies f\_offset
with filter bandwidth, according to table 9.7.5.2.4.7-1, shall not
exceed the EIRP limits indicated in the table.

For Band 32, this requirement applies in the frequency range 1452-1492
MHz when non-Mobile/Fixed Communications Network (MFCN) services are
deployed in adjacent frequency ranges, while it applies also within
1427-1452 MHz and/or 1492-1517 MHz when MFCN services are deployed in
such frequency ranges, even though part of the ranges falls in the
spurious domain. For Band 75, this requirement applies in the frequency
range 1427-1517 MHz. For Band 76, this requirement applies in the
frequency range 1432-1517 MHz even though part of the range falls in the
spurious domain.

##### 9.7.5.4.6 Additional requirements

###### 9.7.5.4.6.1 Additional operating band unwanted emission limits for E-UTRA bands

These requirements may be applied for the protection of other systems
operating inside or near each supported E-UTRA, E-UTRA with NB-IoT and
NB-IoT BS downlink operating band. The limits may apply as an optional
protection of such systems that are deployed in the same geographical
area as the E-UTRA BS, or they may be set by local or regional
regulation as a mandatory requirement for an E-UTRA operating band. It
is in some cases not stated in the present document whether a
requirement is mandatory or under what exact circumstances that a limit
applies, since this is set by local or regional regulation. An overview
of regional requirements in the present document is given in subclause
4.3.

In certain regions the following requirement may apply. For E-UTRA,
emissions shall not exceed the maximum levels specified in Tables
9.7.5.4.6.1-1.

In certain regions, the following requirements may apply to an E-UTRA,
E-UTRA with NB-IoT and NB-IoT TDD BS operating in the same geographic
area and in the same operating band as another E-UTRA TDD system without
synchronisation. For this case the emissions shall not exceed -52
dBm/MHz in each supported downlink operating band except in:

\- The frequency range from 10 MHz below the lower channel edge to the
frequency 10 MHz above the upper channel edge of each supported band.

###### 9.7.5.4.6.2 Protection of DTT 

In certain regions the following requirement may apply for protection of
DTT. For an AAS BS operating in Band 20, the level of emissions in the
band 470-790 MHz, measured in an 8 MHz filter bandwidth on centre
frequencies F~filter~ according to table 9.7.5.4.6.2-1, shall not exceed
the maximum emission TRP level shown in the table. This requirement
applies in the frequency range 470-790 MHz even though part of the range
falls in the spurious domain.

### 9.7.6 OTA Spurious emission

#### 9.7.6.1 General

The OTA spurious emissions limits are specified as TRP per *RIB* unless
otherwise specified.

The OTA transmitter spurious emission limits apply from 30 MHz to
12.75 GHz, excluding the following RAT-specific frequency ranges:

\- UTRA FDD BS as specified in TS 25.104 \[2\]: from 12.5MHz below the
lowest carrier frequency used up to 12.5MHz above the highest carrier
frequency used.

> \- E-UTRA BS as specified in TS 36.104 \[4\]: from Δf~OBUE~ below the
> lowest frequency of the *downlink operating band* up to Δf~OBUE~ above
> the highest frequency of the *downlink operating band*, where Δf~OBUE~
> is defined in subclause 9.7.1.

\- MSR BS as specified in TS 37.104 \[5\]: from Δf~OBUE~ below the
lowest frequency of the *downlink operating band* up to Δf~OBUE~ above
the highest frequency of the *downlink operating band*, where Δf~OBUE~
is defined in subclause 9.7.1.

For some operating bands the upper frequency limit is higher than
12.75 GHz in order to comply with the 5^th^ harmonic limit of the
*downlink operating band*, as specified in ITU-R recommendation SM.329
\[14\]. In some exceptional cases, requirements apply also closer than
Δf~OBUE~ MHz from the *downlink operating band*; these cases are
highlighted in the requirement tables in respective referenced UTRA,
E-UTRA or MSR specifications. For operating bands supported by
*multi-band RIB* each supported band including the Δf~OBUE~ around the
band are excluded from the spurious emissions requirements.

The requirements applies for both *single band* *RIBs* and *multi-band*
*RIBs* (except for frequencies at which exclusion bands or other
multi-band provisions apply) and for all transmission modes foreseen by
the manufacturer\'s specification. Unless otherwise stated, all
requirements are measured as mean power.

For operation in Region 2, where the FCC guidance for MIMO systems in
\[18\] is applicable, the emissions limits are the same regardless of
the number of transceiver units so the limits are equivalent to those
for a single transceiver unit as specified in the *as the corresponding
applicable non-AAS BS per transmitter requirement specified in* 3GPP TS
25.104 \[2\], 3GPP TS 25.105 \[3\], 3GPP TS 36.104 \[4\] or 3GPP TS
37.104 \[5\]. For E-UTRA the limits will be 9dB lower and for UTRA FDD
the limits will be 6 dB lower, unless stated differently in regional
regulation.

The AAS BS requirements for spurious emissions limits which are
specified for Band 46 or for Band 49 in 3GPP TS 37.104 \[5\], are
applicable for AAS BS.

For BS operating in bands n50, n51, n74, n75 and n76 additional emission
limits that might be applicable in the spurious emissions frequency
domain are specified in clause 9.7.5.2.4.7.

#### 9.7.6.2 MSR operation

##### 9.7.6.2.1 Minimum requirement for MSR operation 

###### 9.7.6.2.1.1 Minimum requirement (Category A)

The TRP of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits in table
9.7.6.2.1.1-1

###### 9.7.6.2.1.2 Minimum requirement (Category B)

For UTRA, the minimum requirement is specified in subclause 9.7.6.3.1.2

For E-UTRA, the minimum requirement is specified in subclause
9.7.6.4.1.2

For NR, the minimum requirement is specified in 3GPP TS 38.104 \[27\] in
subclause 9.7.5.2.2.

###### 9.7.6.2.1.3 (void)

##### 9.7.6.2.2 Protection of the BS receiver of own or different BS

This requirement shall be applied for FDD operation in order to prevent
the receivers of own or a different BS of the same band being
desensitised by emissions from a *OTA AAS BS*.

The requirement is a co-location requirement. The power levels are
specified at the *co-location reference antenna* output.

The power sum of any spurious emissions is specified over all supported
polarizations of the *co-location reference antenna* and shall not
exceed the limits in table 9.7.6.2.2-1 depending on the declared Base
Station class and Band Category.

Table 9.7.6.2.2-1: BS Spurious emissions limits for protection of the BS
receiver

##### 9.7.6.2.3 Additional spurious emissions requirements

For UTRA, the minimum requirement is specified in subclause 9.7.6.3.3

For E-UTRA, the minimum requirement is specified in subclause 9.7.6.4.3

For NR, the minimum requirement is specified in 3GPP TS 38.104 \[27\]
subclause 9.7.5.2.4.

##### 9.7.6.2.4 Co-location with other base stations

For UTRA, the minimum requirement for Co-location with other base
stations is specified in subclause 9.7.6.3.4

For E-UTRA, the minimum requirement for Co-location with other base
stations is specified in subclause 9.7.6.4.4

For NR, the minimum requirement for Co-location with other base stations
is specified in 3GPP TS 38.104 \[27\] subclause 9.7.5.2.5

#### 9.7.6.3 Minimum requirement for single RAT UTRA operation

##### 9.7.6.3.1 Mandatory Requirements

###### 9.7.6.3.1.1 Minimum requirement (Category A)

The minimum requirement for single RAT UTRA BS is the same as that
defined for an MSR BS in subclause 9.7.6.2.1.1.

###### 9.7.6.3.1.2 Minimum requirement (Category B)

The following limits shall be met in cases where Category B limits for
spurious emissions, as defined in ITU-R Recommendation SM.329 \[17\],
are applied.

The TRP of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits in table
9.7.6.2.1.1-2

Table 9.7.6.3.1.2-1: *OTA AAS BS* Mandatory spurious emissions limits,
operating band I, II, III, IV, VII, X, XXII, XXV, XXXII (Category B)

##### 9.7.6.3.2 Protection of the BS receiver of own or different BS

This requirement shall be applied for UTRA FDD operation in order to
prevent the receivers of own or a different BS of the same band being
desensitised by emissions from a *OTA AAS BS*.

The requirement is a co-location requirement. The power levels are
specified at the *co-location reference antenna* output.

The power sum of any spurious emission is specified over all supported
polarizations of the *co-location reference antenna* and shall not
exceed the limits in table 9.7.6.3.2-1.

receiver

##### 9.7.6.3.3 Additional spurious emissions requirements

The TRP of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits of table
9.7.6.3.3-1 for a AAS BS where requirements for co-existence with the
system listed in the first column apply. For a *multi-band RIB*, the
exclusions and conditions in the notes column of table 9.7.6.3.3-1 apply
for each supported operating band.

##### 9.7.6.3.4 Co-location with other base stations

###### 9.7.6.3.4.1 General

These requirements may be applied for the protection of other BS
receivers when GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850, CDMA850, UTRA FDD, UTRA
TDD, E-UTRA BS and/or NR BS are co-located with a BS.

The requirements assume with base stations of the same class.

NOTE: For co-location with UTRA, the requirements are based on
co-location with UTRA FDD or TDD base stations.

The requirements are co-location emission requirements are specified as
the power sum of the supported polarization(s) at the *co-location
reference* antenna conducted output(s).

###### 9.7.6.3.4.2 Minimum Requirement

The output of the *co-location reference antenna* of any spurious
emission shall not exceed the limits of table 9.7.6.3.4.2-1 for a AAS BS
where requirements for co-location with a BS type listed in the first
column apply, depending on the declared Base Station class. For a
*multi-band RIB*, the exclusions and conditions in the Notes column of
table 9.7.6.3.4.2-1 apply for each supported operating band.

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this
subclause, the co-location requirements in table 9.7.6.3.4.2-1 do not
apply for the 10 MHz frequency range immediately outside the BS transmit
frequency range of a *downlink operating band* (see subclause 9.7.1).
The current state-of-the-art technology does not allow a single generic
solution for co-location with other system on adjacent frequencies for
30 dB BS-BS minimum coupling loss. However, there are certain
site-engineering solutions that can be used. These techniques are
addressed in TR 25.942 \[12\].

NOTE 2: Table 9.7.6.3.4.2-1 assumes that two operating bands, where the
corresponding BS transmit and receive frequency ranges in subclause
9.7.1 would be overlapping, are not deployed in the same geographical
area. For such a case of operation with overlapping frequency
arrangements in the same geographical area, special co-location
requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.

NOTE 3: Co-located TDD base stations that are synchronized and using the
same or adjacent operating band can transmit without special
co-locations requirements. For unsynchronized base stations, special
co-location requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP
specifications.

#### 9.7.6.4 Minimum requirement for single RAT E-UTRA operation

##### 9.7.6.4.1 Mandatory Requirements

###### 9.7.6.4.1.1 Minimum requirement (Category A)

The minimum requirement for single RAT E-UTRA BS is the same as that
defined for an MSR BS in subclause 9.7.6.2.1.1.

###### 9.7.6.4.1.2 Minimum Requirement (Category B)

The TRP of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits in table
9.7.6.4.1.2-1

##### 9.7.6.4.2 Protection of the BS receiver of own or different BS

This requirement shall be applied for E-UTRA FDD operation in order to
prevent the receivers of own or a different BS of the same band being
desensitised by emissions from a *OTA AAS BS*.

The requirement is a co-location requirement. The power levels are
specified at the *co-location reference antenna* output.

The power sum of any spurious emission is specified over all supported
polarizations of the *co-location reference antenna* and shall not
exceed the limits in table 9.7.6.4.2-1.

Table 9.7.6.4.2-1: BS Spurious emissions limits for protection of the BS
receiver

##### 9.7.6.4.3 Additional spurious emissions requirements

###### 9.7.6.4.3.1 General

These requirements may be applied for the protection of system operating
in frequency ranges other than the BS *downlink operating band*. The
limits may apply as an optional protection of such systems that are
deployed in the same geographical area as the BS, or they may be set by
local or regional regulation as a mandatory requirement for an operating
band. It is in some cases not stated in the present document whether a
requirement is mandatory or under what exact circumstances that a limit
applies, since this is set by local or regional regulation. An overview
of regional requirements in the present document is given in subclause
4.5.

Some requirements may apply for the protection of specific equipment
(UE, MS and/or BS) or equipment operating in specific systems (GSM/EDGE,
CDMA, UTRA, E-UTRA, NR, etc.) as listed below.

All additional spurious requirements are TRP unless otherwise stated.

###### 9.7.6.4.3.2 Minimum Requirement

The TRP of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits of table
9.7.6.4.3.2-1 for an AAS BS where requirements for co-existence with the
system listed in the first column apply. For a *multi-band RIB*, the
exclusions and conditions in the notes column of table 9.7.6.4.3.2-1
apply for each supported operating band.

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this
subclause, except for the cases where the noted requirements apply to a
BS operating in Band 25, Band 27, Band 28 or Band 29, the co-existence
requirements in table 9.7.6.2.3.2-1 do not apply for the Δf~OBUE~
frequency range immediately outside the *downlink operating band* (see
subclause 9.7.1). Emission limits for this excluded frequency range may
be covered by local or regional requirements.

NOTE 2: Table 9.7.6.2.3.2-1 assumes that two operating bands, where the
frequency ranges in subclause 9.7.1 would be overlapping, are not
deployed in the same geographical area. For such a case of operation
with overlapping frequency arrangements in the same geographical area,
special co-existence requirements may apply that are not covered by the
3GPP specifications.

NOTE 3: For the protection of DCS1800, UTRA Band III or E-UTRA Band 3 in
China, the frequency ranges of the downlink and uplink protection
requirements are 1805 -- 1850 MHz and 1710 -- 1755 MHz respectively.

NOTE 4: TDD base stations deployed in the same geographical area, that
are synchronized and use the same or adjacent operating bands can
transmit without additional co-existence requirements. For
unsynchronized base stations (except in Band 46, or in Band 49), special
co-existence requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP
specifications.

NOTE 6: For Band 28 BS, specific solutions may be required to fulfil the
spurious emissions limits for BS for co-existence with Band 27 UL
operating band.

NOTE 7: For Band 29 BS, specific solutions may be required to fulfil the
spurious emissions limits for BS for co-existence with UTRA Band XII or
E-UTRA Band 12 UL operating band, E-UTRA Band 17 UL operating band or
E-UTRA Band 85 UL operating band.

The following requirement may be applied for the protection of PHS. This
requirement is also applicable at specified frequencies falling between
Δf~OBUE~ below the lowest BS transmitter frequency of the *downlink
operating band* and Δf~OBUE~ above the highest BS transmitter frequency
of the *downlink operating band*.

The TRP of any spurious emission shall not exceed:

##### 9.7.6.4.4 Co-location with other base stations

###### 9.7.6.4.4.1 General

These requirements may be applied for the protection of other BS
receivers when GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850, CDMA850, UTRA FDD, UTRA
TDD E-UTRA BS and/or NR BS are co-located with a BS.

The requirements assume with base stations of the same class.

NOTE: For co-location with UTRA, the requirements are based on
co-location with UTRA FDD or TDD base stations.

The requirement is a co-location requirement. The power levels are
specified at the *co-location reference antenna* output.

###### 9.7.6.4.4.2 Minimum Requirement

The power sum of any spurious emission is specified over all supported
polarizations of the *co-location reference antenna* and shall not
exceed the limits of table 9.7.6.4.4.2-1 for a AAS BS where requirements
for co-location with a BS type listed in the first column apply,
depending on the declared Base Station class. For a *multi-band RIB* ,
the exclusions and conditions in the notes column of table 9.7.6.4.4.2-1
apply for each supported operating band.

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this
subclause, the co-location requirements in table 9.7.6.4.4.2-1 do not
apply for the Δf~OBUE~ frequency range immediately outside the BS
transmit frequency range of a *downlink operating band* (see subclause
9.7.1). The current state-of-the-art technology does not allow a single
generic solution for co-location with other system on adjacent
frequencies for 30 dB BS-BS minimum coupling loss. However, there are
certain site-engineering solutions that can be used. These techniques
are addressed in TR 25.942 \[12\].

NOTE 2: Table 9.7.6.4.4.2-1 assumes that two operating bands, where the
corresponding BS transmit and receive frequency ranges in subclause
9.7.1 would be overlapping, are not deployed in the same geographical
area. For such a case of operation with overlapping frequency
arrangements in the same geographical area, special co-location
requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.

NOTE 3: Co-located TDD base stations that are synchronized and using the
same or adjacent operating band can transmit without special
co-locations requirements. For unsynchronized base stations, special
co-location requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP
specifications.

9.8 OTA Transmitter intermodulation
-----------------------------------

### 9.8.1 General

The OTA transmitter intermodulation requirement is a measure of the
capability of the transmitter unit to inhibit the generation of signals
in its non-linear elements caused by presence of the wanted signal and
an interfering signal reaching the transmitter unit via the RDN and
antenna array from a co-located base station. The requirement applies
during the *transmitter ON period* and the *transmitter transient
period*.

The requirement applies at each RIB supporting transmission in the
operating band.

The transmitter intermodulation level is the *total radiated power* of
the intermodulation products when an interfering signal is injected into
the *co-location reference antenna*.

### 9.8.2 Minimum requirement for MSR operation

#### 9.8.2.1 General minimum requirement

The transmitter intermodulation level shall not exceed the unwanted
emission limits specified for OTA transmitter spurious emission in
subclause 9.7.6.1, 9.7.6.2.1 and 9.7.6.2.3, OTA operating band unwanted
emission in subclause 9.7.5 and OTA ACLR in subclause 9.7.3 in the
presence of a wanted signal and an interfering signal according to table
9.8.2.1‑1 for *OTA AAS BS* operation in BC1, BC2 and BC3.

The requirement is applicable outside the *Base Station RF Bandwidth
edges*. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the *Base
Station RF Bandwidth* *edges* or *Radio Bandwidth* edges.

For RIB*s* supporting operation in *non-contiguous spectrum*, the
requirement is also applicable inside a *sub-block gap* for interfering
signal offsets where the interfering signal falls completely within the
*sub-block gap*. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to
the *sub-block* edges.

For *multi-band RIBs*, the requirement applies relative to the *Base
Station RF Bandwidth* *edges* of each operating band. In case the inter
*Base Station RF Bandwidth* gap is less than 15 MHz, the requirement in
the gap applies only for interfering signal offsets where the
interfering signal falls completely within the inter *Base Station RF
Bandwidth* gap.

edges for BC2. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the
*Base Station RF Bandwidth* *edges*.

For RIBs supporting operation in *non-contiguous spectrum* in BC1 or
BC2, the requirement is also applicable inside a *sub-block gap* with a
gap size larger than or equal to two times the interfering signal centre
frequency offset. For RIBs supporting operation in *non-contiguous
spectrum* in BC1, the requirement is not applicable inside a *sub-block
gap* with a gap size equal to or larger than 5 MHz. The interfering
signal offset is defined relative to the *sub-block* edges.

For *multi-band* *RIBs*, the requirement applies relative to the *Base
Station RF Bandwidth* *edges* of a BC2 operating band. The requirement
is also applicable for BC1 and BC2 inside an inter *Base Station RF
Bandwidth* gap equal to or larger than two times the interfering signal
centre frequency offset. For RIBs supporting operation in multiple
operating bands, the requirement is not applicable for BC1 band inside

Table 9.8.4.2-1: Void

10 Radiated receiver characteristics
====================================

10.1 General
------------

OTA receiver characteristics requirements apply to the *AAS BS*
including all its functional components active unless otherwise stated
in each requirement.

Unless otherwise stated the requirements in clause 10 apply during the
AAS BS *receive period.*

The requirements in clause 10 shall be met for any transmitter setting.

The (E-UTRA) and NR throughput requirements defined for the receiver
characteristics in this clause do not assume HARQ retransmissions.

When the AAS BS is configured to receive multiple carriers, all the
throughput requirements are applicable for each received carrier.

Each requirement shall be met over the RoAoA specified.

For requirements which are to be met over the *OTA REFSENS RoAoA*
absolute requirement values are offset by the following term:

Δ~OTAREFSENS~ = 44.1 - 10\*log10(BeW~θ,REFSENS\*~BeW~φ,REFSENS~) (dB)
for the reference direction.

And

Δ~OTAREFSENS~ = 41.1 - 10\*log10(BeW~θ,REFSENS\*~BeW~φ,REFSENS~) (dB)
for all other directions.

For requirements which are to be met over the *minSENS RoAoA* absolute
requirement values are offset by the following term:

> Δ~minSENS~ = P~REFSENS~ -- EIS~minSENS~ (dB)

10.2 OTA sensitivity
--------------------

### 10.2.1 General

The OTA sensitivity requirement is based upon the declaration of one or
more *OTA sensitivity direction declarations* (OSDD), related to an *AAS
BS receiver*.

The *AAS BS receiver* may optionally be capable of redirecting/changing
the *receiver target* by means of adjusting BS settings resulting in
multiple *sensitivity RoAoA*. The *sensitivity RoAoA* resulting from the
current AAS BS settings is the active *sensitivity RoAoA*.

If the AAS BS is capable of redirecting the *receiver target* related to
the OSDD then the OSDD shall include:

\- The set(s) of RAT, *Channel bandwidth* and declared minimum EIS level
applicable to any active *sensitivity RoAoA* inside the *receiver target
redirection range* in the OSDD.

\- A declared *receiver target redirection range*, describing all the
angles of arrival that can be addressed for the OSDD through alternative
settings in the AAS BS.

\- Five declared *sensitivity RoAoA* comprising the conformance testing
directions as detailed in TS 37.145-2 \[30\].

\- The *receiver target reference direction*.

NOTE 1: Some of the declared *sensitivity RoAoA* may coincide depending
on the redirection capability.

NOTE 2: In addition to the declared *sensitivity RoAoA*, several
*sensitivity RoAoA* may be implicitly defined by the *receiver target
redirection range* without being explicitly declared in the OSDD.

NOTE 3: (Void)

If the *AAS BS* is not capable of redirecting the *receiver target*
related to the OSDD, then the OSDD includes only:

\- The set(s) of RAT, *Channel bandwidth* and declared minimum EIS level
applicable to the *sensitivity RoAoA* in the OSDD.

\- One declared active *sensitivity RoAoA*.

\- The *receiver target reference direction*.

NOTE 4: For AAS BS without target redirection capability, the declared
(fixed) *sensitivity RoAoA* is always the active *sensitivity RoAoA*.

The OTA sensitivity EIS level declaration shall apply to each supported
polarization, under the assumption of *polarization match*.

### 10.2.2 Minimum requirement for MSR operation

The minimum requirements for a UTRA FDD and for UTRA TDD 1,28 Mcps
option carrier OTA sensitivity are defined in subclause 10.2.3.

The minimum requirement for an E-UTRA carrier OTA sensitivity is defined
in subclause 10.2.4.

The minimum requirement for an NR carrier OTA sensitivity is the same as
that defined for *BS type 1-O* in 3GPP TS 38.104 \[28\] in subclause
10.2.1.2

### 10.2.3 Minimum requirement for single RAT UTRA operation

For a received signal whose AoA of the incident wave is within the
active *sensitivity RoAoA* of an OSDD, the error rate criterion as
described below shall be met when the level of the arriving signal is
equal to the minimum EIS level in the respective declared set of EIS
level, RAT and *channel bandwidth*.

For UTRA FDD, the BER shall not exceed 0,001, using the 12,2 kbps data
rate reference measurement channel specified in 3GPP TS 25.104 \[2\].

For UTRA TDD 1,28 Mcps option, the BER shall not exceed 0,001, using the
12,2 kbps data rate reference measurement channel specified in 3GPP TS
25.105 \[3\].

NOTE: The requirement applies for all declared sets of EIS, RAT and
*channel bandwidth*, within the OSDD comprising UTRA, and for all
related active *sensitivity RoAoA* settings within the AAS BS
capability.

### 10.2.4 Minimum requirement for single RAT E-UTRA operation

For a received signal whose AoA of the incident wave is within the
active *sensitivity RoAoA* of an OSDD the throughput criterion, as
described below, shall be met when the level of the arriving signal is
equal to the minimum EIS level in the respective declared set of EIS
level, RAT and *channel bandwidth*.

The throughput shall be ≥ 95 % of the *maximum throughput* of the
reference measurement channel as specified in 3GPP TS 36.104 \[4\] with
parameters specified in table 10.2.4-1.

NOTE 1: The requirement applies for all declared sets of EIS level, RAT
and *channel bandwidth*, within the OSDD comprising E-UTRA, and for all
related active *sensitivity RoAoA* settings within the AAS BS
capability.

+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+

NOTE 2: Several OSDD EIS level declarations corresponding to different
*channel bandwidths* may be made.

10.3 OTA Reference sensitivity level
------------------------------------

### 10.3.1 General

The OTA REFSENS requirement is intended to ensure the OTA reference
sensitivity level for a declared *OTA REFSENS RoAoA*.

The OTA reference sensitivity power level EIS~REFSENS~ is the mean power
received at the RIB at which a reference performance requirement shall
be met for a specified reference measurement channel.

The OTA REFSENS requirement shall apply to each supported polarization,
under the assumption of *polarization match*.

### 10.3.2 Minimum requirement for MSR operation

For UTRA, the minimum requirement for reference sensitivity is specified
in subclause 10.3.3.

For E-UTRA, the minimum requirement for reference sensitivity is
specified in subclause 10.3.4.

For NR, the minimum requirement for reference sensitivity is the same as
that specified for *BS type 1-O* in 3GPP TS 38.104 \[28\] in subclause
10.3.2.

### 10.3.3 Minimum requirement for single RAT UTRA operation

If the AoA of the incident wave of a received signal is within the *OTA
REFSENS RoAoA*, the error rate criterion as described below shall be met
when the level of the arriving signal is equal to EIS~REFSENS~.

For UTRA FDD, using the reference measurement channel specified in 3GPP
TS 25.104 \[2\], the OTA reference sensitivity level and performance
shall be as specified in table 10.3.3-1.

+----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+

### 10.3.4 Minimum requirement for single RAT E-UTRA operation

If the AoA of the incident wave of a received signal is within the *OTA
REFSENS RoAoA*, the throughput criterion as described below shall be met
when the level of the arriving signal is equal to EIS~REFSENS~ in the
respective declared *channel bandwidth*.

The throughput shall be ≥ 95 % of the *maximum throughput* of the
reference measurement channel as specified in 3GPP TS 36.104 \[4\] with
parameters specified in table 10.3.4-1 for Wide Area BS, in table
10.3.4-2 for Local Area BS and in table 10.3.4-3 for Medium Range BS.

10.4 OTA Dynamic range
----------------------

#### 10.4.1 General

The OTA dynamic range is a measure of the capability of the receiver
unit to receive a wanted signal in the presence of an interfering signal
inside the received *channel bandwidth* or the capability of receiving
high level of wanted signal.

The requirement applies at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave of
a received signal and the interfering signal are from the same direction
and are within the OTA REFSENS *RoAoA.*

The wanted and interfering signals apply to each supported polarization,
under the assumption of *polarization match*.

#### 10.4.2 Minimum requirement for MSR operation

For UTRA, the minimum requirement for dynamic range is specified in
subclause 10.4.3.

For E-UTRA, the minimum requirement for dynamic range is specified in
subclause 10.4.4.

For NR, the minimum requirement for dynamic range is the same as that
specified for BS type 1-O in 3GPP TS 38.104 \[28\] in subclause 10.4.2

#### 10.4.3 Minimum requirement for single RAT UTRA operation

The BER shall not exceed 0.001 for the parameters specified in table
10.4.3-1

#### 10.4.4 Minimum requirement for single RAT E-UTRA operation

For E-UTRA, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the *maximum throughput* of
the reference measurement channel as specified in 3GPP TS 36.104 \[8\],
annex A with parameters specified in table 10.4.4-1 for Wide Area BS, in
table 10.4.4-2 for Local Area BS **and in table 10.4.4-3 for Medium

10.5 OTA Adjacent channel selectivity, general blocking, and narrowband blocking
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 10.5.1 General

The adjacent channel selectivity (ACS), general blocking and narrowband
blocking characteristics are measures of the receiver unit ability to
receive a wanted signal at its assigned channel in the presence of an
unwanted interferer inside the operating band.

The requirement applies at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave of
a received signal and the interfering signal are from the same
direction, and:

\- when the wanted signal is based on EIS~REFSENS~ : the AoA of the
incident wave of a received signal and the interfering signal are within
the OTA REFSENS *RoAoA.*

\- when the wanted signal is based on EIS~minSENS~ : the AoA of the
incident wave of a received signal and the interfering signal are within
the within the *minSENS RoAoA*.

The wanted and interfering signals apply to each supported polarization,
under the assumption o*f polarization match*.

NOTE: For Single RAT requirements, the in-band selectivity
characteristics is referred to as \"adjacent channel selectivity\",
whereas for the MSR requirements, the corresponding property is referred
to as \"general blocking\" since the adjacent frequency range may not
carry a channel addressable from the interfered carrier.

The in-band blocking requirement applies from F~UL\_low~ - Δf~OOB~ to
F~UL\_high~ + Δf~OOB~, excluding the downlink frequency range of the FDD
*operating band*. The Δf~OOB~ is defined in table 10.5-1.

Table 10.5-1: Δf~OOB~ offset for operating bands

  *Operating band* characteristics                Δf~OOB~ \[MHz\]
  ----------------------------------------------- -----------------
  F~UL\_high~ -- F~UL\_low~ \< 100 MHz            20
  100 MHz ≤ F~UL\_high~ -- F~UL\_low~ ≤ 900 MHz   60

### 10.5.2 Minimum requirement for MSR operation

#### 10.5.2.1 General minimum requirement

For the general blocking requirement, the interfering signal shall be a
UTRA FDD signal as specified in 3GPP TS 37.104 \[9\], annex A for a
UTRA, E-UTRA or NR (≤ 20 MHz) wanted signal. The interfering signal
shall be a 20 MHz E-UTRA signal for NR wanted signal channel bandwidth
greater than 20MHz.

The requirement is applicable outside the *Base Station RF Bandwidth* or
*Radio Bandwidth*. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to
the *Base Station RF Bandwidth* *edges* or *Radio Bandwidth* edges
applicable to each RIB.

For RIB supporting operation in *non-contiguous spectrum*, the
requirement applies in addition inside any *sub-block gap*, in case the
*sub-block gap* size is at least 15 MHz. The interfering signal offset
is defined relative to the *sub-block* edges inside the *sub-block gap*.

For *multi-band RIBs*, the requirement applies in addition inside any
*Inter RF Bandwidth gap*, in case the gap size is at least 15 MHz. The
interfering signal offset is defined relative to the *Base Station RF
Bandwidth* *edges* inside the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*.

For the wanted and interfering signal at the RIB, using the parameters
in tables 7.4.2.1‑1 and 7.4.2.1‑2, the following requirements shall be
met:

\- For any E-UTRA carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95 % of the
*maximum throughput* of the reference measurement channel defined in
3GPP TS 36.104 \[8\], subclause 7.2.1.

\- For any UTRA FDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0,001 for the
reference measurement channel defined in 3GPP TS 25.104 \[6\], subclause
7.2.1.

\- For any NR carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channel defined for *BS type
1-O* in TS 38.104 \[28\], subclause 10.3.2

The OTA levels are applied referenced to 2 antenna gain offsets
Δ~OTAREFSENS~ and Δ~minSENS~.

For *multi-band RIBs*, the requirement applies according to table
10.5.2.1-1 for the in-band blocking frequency ranges of each supported
operating band.

Table 10.5.2.1-2: (Void)

NOTE: The requirement in table 10.5.2.1-1 assumes that two operating
bands, where the *downlink operating band* (see subclause 4.5 in 3GPP TS
37.104 \[9\]) of one band would be within the in-band blocking region of
the other band, are not deployed in the same geographical area.

#### 10.5.2.2 General narrowband blocking minimum requirement

For the general narrowband blocking requirement, the interfering signal
shall be an E-UTRA 1RB signal as specified in 3GPP TS 37.104 \[9\],
annex A.

The requirement is applicable outside the *Base Station RF Bandwidth* or
*Radio Bandwidth*. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to
the *Base Station RF Bandwidth* *edges* or *Radio Bandwidth* edges.

For RIBs supporting operation in *non-contiguous spectrum*, the
requirement applies in addition inside any *sub-block gap*, in case the
*sub-block gap* size is at least 3 MHz. The interfering signal offset is
defined relative to the *sub-block* edges inside the *sub-block gap*.

For *multi-band RIBs*, the requirement applies in addition inside any
*Inter RF Bandwidth gap*, in case the gap size is at least 3 MHz. The
interfering signal offset is defined relative to the *Base Station RF
Bandwidth* *edges* inside the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*.

For the wanted and interfering signal at the RIB using the parameters in
table 10.5.2.2‑1, the following requirements shall be met:

\- For any E-UTRA carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95 % of the
*maximum throughput* of the reference measurement channel defined in
3GPP TS 36.104 \[8\], subclause 7.2.1.

\- For any UTRA FDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0,001 for the
reference measurement channel defined in 3GPP TS 25.104 \[6\], subclause
7.2.1.

\- For any NR carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channel defined for *BS type
1-O* in TS 38.104 \[28\], subclause 10.3.2

#### 10.5.2.3 Additional BC3 blocking minimum requirement

This additional requirement only applies for BS operating in the same
geographical area as UTRA TDD.

For the additional BC3 blocking requirement, the interfering signal is a
1,28 Mcps UTRA TDD signal as specified in 3GPP TS 37.104 \[9\], annex A.

The requirement is always applicable outside the *Base Station RF
Bandwidth* or *Radio Bandwidth*. The interfering signal offset is
defined relative to the *Base Station RF Bandwidth* *edges* or *Radio
Bandwidth* edges.

For *multi-band RIBs*, the requirement applies in addition inside any
*Inter RF Bandwidth gap*, in case the gap size is at least 4.8 MHz. The
interfering signal offset is defined relative to the *Base Station RF
Bandwidth* *edges* inside the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*.

For the wanted and interfering signal at the RIB, using the parameters
in table 10.5.2.3‑1, the following requirements shall be met:

\- For any E-UTRA TDD carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95 % of the
*maximum throughput* of the reference measurement channel defined in
3GPP TS 36.104 \[8\], subclause 7.2.1.

### 10.5.3 Minimum requirement for single RAT UTRA operation

#### 10.5.3.1 General

Adjacent channel selectivity (ACS) is a measure of the receiver ability
to receive a wanted signal at its assigned channel frequency in the
presence of an adjacent channel signal at a given frequency offset from
the centre frequency of the assigned channel. ACS is the ratio of the
receiver filter attenuation on the assigned channel frequency to the
receiver filter attenuation on the adjacent channel(s).

The interference signal is offset from the wanted signal by the
frequency offset Fuw. The interference signal shall be a W-CDMA signal
as specified in 3GPP TS 25.104 \[6\] Annex C.

For RIBs supporting operation in *non-contiguous spectrum*, the
requirement applies in addition inside any *sub-block gap*, in case the
*sub-block gap* size is at least 5 MHz. The interfering signal offset is
defined relative to the *sub-block* edges inside the *sub-block gap* and
is equal to -2.5MHz/+2.5MHz, respectively.

For *multi-band RIBs*, the requirement applies in addition inside any
*Inter RF Bandwidth gap* at the RIB, in case the gap size is at least 5
MHz. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the *Base
Station RF Bandwidth* *edges* inside the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* and is
equal to -2.5MHz/+2.5MHz, respectively.

The OTA levels are applied referenced to Δ~minSENS~.

#### 10.5.3.2 Minimum requirement

The BER shall not exceed 0.001 for the parameters specified in table
10.5.3.2-1.

#### 10.5.3.3 Minimum requirement - Co-location with UTRA-TDD

The current state-of-the-art technology does not allow a single generic
solution for co-location with UTRA-TDD on adjacent frequencies for 30dB
BS-BS minimum coupling loss.

Further information and analysis for this scenario can be found in TR
25.942 \[12\].

### 10.5.4 Minimum requirement for single RAT E-UTRA operation

#### 10.5.4.1 General

Adjacent channel selectivity (ACS) is a measure of the receiver ability
to receive a wanted signal at its assigned channel frequency in the
presence of an adjacent channel signal with a specified centre frequency
offset of the interfering signal to the band edge of a victim system.
For E-UTRA *OTA AAS BS*, the interfering signal shall be an E-UTRA
signal as specified in 3GPP TS 36.104 \[8\] Annex C.

#### 10.5.4.2 Minimum requirement

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the *maximum throughput* of the
reference measurement channel.

For E-UTRA Wide Area BS, the wanted and the interfering signal coupled
to the BS antenna input are specified in tables 10.5.4.2-1 and
10.5.4.2-2 for narrowband blocking and in table 10.5.4.2-3 for ACS. The
reference measurement channel for the wanted signal is identified in
table 10.3.4-1 for each *channel bandwidth* and further specified in
3GPP TS 36.104 \[8\] Annex A.

For E-UTRA Medium Range BS, the wanted and the interfering signal
coupled to the BS antenna input are specified in tables 10.5.4.2-1 and
10.5.4.2-2 for narrowband blocking and in table 10.5.4.2-6 for ACS.
Narrowband blocking requirements are not applied for Band 46. The
reference measurement channel for the wanted signal is identified in
table 10.3.4-3 for each *channel bandwidth* and further specified in
3GPP TS 36.104 \[8\] Annex A.

For E-UTRA Local Area BS, the wanted and the interfering signal coupled
to the BS antenna input are specified in tables 10.5.4.2-1 and
10.5.4.2-2 for narrowband blocking and in table 10.5.4.2-4 for ACS.
Narrowband blocking requirements are not applied for Band 46 nor for
Band 49. The reference measurement channel for the wanted signal is
identified in table 10.3.4-2 for each *channel bandwidth* and further
specified in 3GPP TS 36.104 \[8\] Annex A.

For narrowband blocking the OTA levels are applied referenced to 2
antenna gain offsets Δ~OTAREFSENS~ and Δ~minSENS~.

For ACS the OTA levels are applied referenced to Δ~minSENS~.

The ACS and narrowband blocking requirement is applicable outside the
*Base Station RF Bandwidth* or *Radio Bandwidth*. The interfering signal
offset is defined relative to the *Base station RF Bandwidth edges* or
*Radio Bandwidth* edges.

For RIBs supporting operation in *non-contiguous spectrum* within any
operating band, the ACS requirement applies in addition inside any
*sub-block gap*, in case the *sub-block gap* size is at least as wide as
the E-UTRA interfering signal in table 10.5.4.2-3, 10.5.4.2-4 and
10.5.4.2-5. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the
*sub-block* edges inside the *sub-block gap*

For *multi-band RIBs*, the ACS requirement applies in addition inside
any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* at the RIB, in case the gap size is at
least as wide as the E-UTRA interfering signal in table 10.5.4.2-3,
10.5.4.2-4 and 10.5.4.2-5. The interfering signal offset is defined
relative to the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edges* inside the *Inter RF
Bandwidth gap*.

For a RIBs operating in *non-contiguous spectrum* within any operating
band, the narrowband blocking requirement applies in addition inside any
*sub-block gap*, in case the *sub-block gap* size is at least as wide as
the *channel bandwidth* of the E-UTRA interfering signal in table
10.5.4.2-2. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the
*sub-block* edges inside the *sub-block gap*.

For *multi-band RIBs*,, the narrowband blocking requirement applies in
addition inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*, in case the *Inter RF
Bandwidth gap* size is at least as wide as the E-UTRA interfering signal
in table 10.5.4.2-2. The interfering signal offset is defined relative
to the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edges* inside the *Inter RF Bandwidth
gap*.

10.6 OTA Blocking
-----------------

### 10.6.1 General

The blocking characteristics are a measure of the receiver unit ability
to receive a wanted signal at the RIB at its assigned channel in the
presence of an unwanted interferer.

The requirement applies at the *RIB* when the AoA of the incident wave
of the received signal and the interfering signal are the same direction
and are within the *minSENS RoAoA*

The wanted signal applies to each supported polarization, under the
assumption of *polarization match.* The interferer shall be polarization
matched in-band and the polarization maintained for out-of-band
frequencies.

The out-of-band blocking requirement applies from 30 MHz to F~UL\_low~ -
Δf~OOB~ and from F~UL\_high~ + Δf~OOB~ up to 12750 MHz, including the
downlink frequency range of the FDD *operating band* for BS supporting
FDD. Δf~OOB~ is defined in table 10.5-1.

### 10.6.2 Minimum requirement for MSR operation

#### 10.6.2.1 General minimum requirement

The OTA interfering signal RMS field-strength shall be set to 0.36 V/m
at the RIB.

NOTE: The RMS field-strength level in V/m is related to the interferer
EIRP level at a distance described as , where EIRP is in W and r is in
m; for example, 0.36 V/m is equivalent to 36 dBm at fixed distance of 30
m.

For a wanted and an interfering signal coupled to the RIB using the
parameters in table 10.6.2.1-1, the following requirements shall be met:

\- For any E-UTRA carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95 % of the
*maximum throughput* of the reference measurement channel defined in
3GPP TS 36.104 \[8\], subclause 7.2.1.

\- For any UTRA FDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0.001 for the
reference measurement channel defined in 3GPP TS 25.104 \[6\], subclause
7.2.1.

\- For any NR carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channel defined for *BS type
1-O* in TS 38.104 \[28\], subclause 10.3.2.

For *multi-band RIB*, the requirement applies for each supported
operating band. The in-band blocking frequency ranges of all supported
operating bands according to table 10.6.2.1-1 shall be excluded from the
requirement.

  NOTE 1: EIS~minSENS~ depends on the RAT, the BS class and the channel bandwidth, see subclause 7.2.\                                      
  \"x\" is equal to 6 in case of NR, E-UTRA or UTRA wanted signals.                                                                         
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ---------------------------------- ----------------------------

#### 10.6.2.2 Co-location minimum requirement

This additional blocking requirement may be applied for the protection
of *AAS BS receivers* when E-UTRA BS, NR BS, UTRA BS, CDMA BS or
GSM/EDGE BS operating in a different frequency band are co-located with
an AAS BS.

The requirement is a co-location requirement. The interferer power
levels are specified at the *co-location reference antenna* conducted
input. The interfering power is specified per supported polarization.

The requirement is valid over *minSENS RoAoA*.

When the wanted and an interfering signal using the parameters in table
10.6.2.2-1, the following requirements shall be met:

\- For any E-UTRA carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95 % of the
*maximum throughput* of the reference measurement channel defined in
3GPP TS 36.104 \[8\], subclause 7.2.1.

\- For any UTRA FDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0,001 for the
reference measurement channel defined in 3GPP TS 25.104 \[6\], subclause
7.2.1.

### 10.6.3 Minimum requirement for single RAT UTRA operation

#### 10.6.3.1 General minimum requirement

In addition to the following in-band and narrowband requirements, the
general minimum requirements relating to out of band blocking defined
for MSR in subclause 10.6.2.1 shall also be applied for single RAT UTRA
operation.

The minimum requirement for in-band blocking and narrowband blocking
UTRA operation is defined below:

The requirement is applicable outside the *Base Station RF Bandwidth* or
*Radio Bandwidth*. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to
the *Base Station RF Bandwidth* *edges* or *Radio Bandwidth* edges
applicable to each RIB.

For RIB supporting operation in *non-contiguous spectrum*, the
requirement applies in addition inside any *sub-block gap*, in case the
*sub-block gap* size is at least 15MHz. The interfering signal offset is
defined relative to the *sub-block* edges inside the *sub-block gap* and
is equal to -7.5MHz/+7.5MHz, respectively.

For a RIB supporting operation in *non-contiguous spectrum* the
narrowband blocking requirement applies in addition inside any
*sub-block gap*, in case the *sub-block gap* size is at least 400kHz or
600kHz, depending on the operating band. The interfering signal offset
is defined relative to the *sub-block* edges inside the *sub-block gap*
and is equal to -200kHz/+200kHz or -300kHz/+300kHz, respectively.

For *multi-band RIBs* the requirement in the in-band blocking frequency
range applies for each supported operating band. The requirement applies
in addition inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*, in case *Inter RF
Bandwidth gap* size is at least 15MHz. The interfering signal offset is
defined relative to lower/upper *Base Station RF Bandwidth* *edges*
inside the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* and is equal to -7.5MHz/+7.5MHz,
respectively.

For *multi-band RIBs* the narrowband blocking requirement applies in
addition inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*, in case the *Inter RF
Bandwidth gap* size is at least 400kHz or 600kHz, depending on the
operating band. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to
lower/upper *Base Station RF Bandwidth* *edges* inside the *Inter RF
Bandwidth gap* and is equal to -200kHz/+200kHz or -300kHz/+300kHz,
respectively.

For the wanted and interfering signal at the RIB, using the parameters
in tables 10.6.4.1‑1 and 10.6.4.1‑2, the following requirements shall be
met:

\- For any UTRA FDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0,001 for the
reference measurement channel defined in 3GPP TS 25.104 \[6\], subclause
7.2.1.

The OTA levels are applied referenced to 2 antenna gain offsets
Δ~OTAREFSENS~ and Δ~minSENS~.

#### 10.6.3.2 Co-location minimum requirement

This additional blocking requirement may be applied for the protection
of *AAS BS receivers* when E-UTRA BS, NR BS, UTRA BS, CDMA BS or
GSM/EDGE BS operating in a different frequency band are co-located with
an AAS BS.

The requirement is a co-location requirement. The interferer power
levels are specified at the *co-location reference antenna* conducted
input. The interfering power is specified per supported polarization.

The requirement is valid over *minSENS RoAoA*.

When the wanted and an interfering signal using the parameters in table
10.6.2.2-1 for co-location with UTRA or E-UTRA systems and table
10.6.3.2-1 for co-location with GSM systems, the following requirements
shall be met:

\- For any UTRA FDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0,001 for the
reference measurement channel defined in 3GPP TS 25.104 \[6\], subclause
7.2.1.

### 10.6.4 Minimum requirement for single RAT E-UTRA operation

#### 10.6.4.1 General minimum requirement

In addition to the following in-band and narrowband requirements, the
general minimum requirements relating to out of band blocking defined
for MSR in subclause 10.6.2.1 shall also be applied for single RAT
E-UTRA operation.

The minimum requirement for in-band blocking E-UTRA operation is defined
below:

The requirement is applicable outside the *Base Station RF Bandwidth* or
*Radio Bandwidth*. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to
the *Base Station RF Bandwidth* *edges* or *Radio Bandwidth* edges
applicable to each RIB.

For RIB supporting operation in *non-contiguous spectrum*, the
requirement applies in addition inside any *sub-block gap*, in case the
*sub-block gap* size is at least 15 MHz. The interfering signal offset
is defined relative to the *sub-block* edges inside the *sub-block gap*.

For *multi-band RIBs*, the requirement applies in addition inside any
*Inter RF Bandwidth gap*, in case the gap size is at least 15 MHz. The
interfering signal offset is defined relative to the *Base Station RF
Bandwidth* *edges* inside the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*.

For the wanted and interfering signal at the RIB, using the parameters
in tables 10.6.4.1‑1 and 10.6.4.1‑2, the following requirements shall be
met:

\- For any E-UTRA carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95 % of the
*maximum throughput* of the reference measurement channel defined in
3GPP TS 36.104 \[8\], subclause 7.2.1.

The OTA levels are applied referenced to 2 antenna gain offsets
Δ~OTAREFSENS~ and Δ~minSENS~.

For *multi-band RIBs*, the requirement applies according to table
10.6.4.1-1 for the in-band blocking frequency ranges of each supported
operating band.

#### 10.6.4.2 Co-location minimum requirement

This additional blocking requirement may be applied for the protection
of *AAS BS receivers* when E-UTRA BS, NR BS, UTRA BS, CDMA BS or
GSM/EDGE BS operating in a different frequency band are co-located with
an AAS BS.

The requirement is a co-location requirement. The interferer power
levels are specified at the *co-location reference antenna* conducted
input. The interfering power is specified per supported polarization.

The requirement is valid over *minSENS RoAoA*.

When the wanted and an interfering signal using the parameters in table
10.6.2.2-1 for co-location with UTRA or E-UTRA systems and table
10.6.4.2-1 for co-location with GSM systems, the following requirements
shall be met:

\- For any E-UTRA carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95 % of the
*maximum throughput* of the reference measurement channel defined in
3GPP TS 36.104 \[8\], subclause 7.2.1.

10.7 OTA Receiver spurious emissions
------------------------------------

### 10.7.1 General

The receiver spurious emission requirement is the power of the emissions
radiated from the antenna array from a receiver unit. For an *OTA AAS
BS* operating in FDD, OTA RX spurious emissions requirement do not apply
as they are superseded by the OTA TX spurious emissions requirement.
This is due to the fact that TX and RX spurious emissions cannot be
distinguished in OTA domain.

NOTE: The OTA receiver spurious emission requirement applicability for
the AAS BS with the RX-only capabilities is not covered by the present
release of this specification.

For an *OTA AAS BS* operating in TDD, the OTA receiver spurious
emissions requirement applies during the *transmitter OFF period* only.

For RX only *multi-band RIB*, the RX spurious emissions requirements are
subject to exclusion zones in each supported operating band.

### 10.7.2 Minimum requirement for MSR operation

### 10.7.2.1 General minimum requirement

There are no OTA receiver spurious emissions requirements for UTRA FDD.

For E-UTRA, the minimum requirement is specified in subclause 10.7.4

For NR, the minimum requirement is the same as that specified for *BS
type 1-O* in TS 38.104 \[28\] in subclause 10.7.2

### 10.7.3 Minimum requirement for single RAT UTRA operation

There are no OTA receiver spurious emissions requirements for single RAT
UTRA FDD.

### 10.7.4 Minimum requirement for single RAT E-UTRA operation

The TRP of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits in table
10.7.4-1:

+----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+

In addition to the requirements in table 10.7.4-1, the power of any
spurious emission shall not exceed the levels specified for Protection
of the E-UTRA FDD BS receiver of own or different BS in subclause
9.7.6.4.2 and for Co-existence with other systems in the same
geographical area in subclause 9.7.6.4.3. In addition, the co-existence
requirements for co-located base stations specified in subclause
9.7.6.4.4 may also be applied.

10.8 OTA Receiver intermodulation
---------------------------------

### 10.8.1 General

Third and higher order mixing of the two interfering RF signals can
produce an interfering signal in the band of the desired channel.
Intermodulation response rejection is a measure of the capability of the
receiver unit to receive a wanted signal on its assigned channel
frequency in the presence of two interfering signals which have a
specific frequency relationship to the wanted signal.

The requirement applies at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave of
a received signal and the interfering signal are from the same
direction, and:

\- when the wanted signal is based on EIS~REFSENS~ : the AoA of the
incident wave of a received signal and the interfering signal are within
the OTA REFSENS *RoAoA.*

\- when the wanted signal is based on EIS~minSENS~ : the AoA of the
incident wave of a received signal and the interfering signal are within
the *minSENS RoAoA*.

The wanted and interfering signals apply to each supported polarization,
under the assumption of *polarization match*.

### 10.8.2 Minimum requirement for MSR operation

#### 10.8.2.1 General intermodulation minimum requirement

Interfering signals shall be a CW signal and an E-UTRA or UTRA signal as
specified in 3GPP TS 37.104 \[9\], annex A.

The requirement is applicable outside the *Base Station RF Bandwidth* or
*Radio Bandwidth*. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to
the *Base Station RF Bandwidth* *edges* or *Radio Bandwidth* edges.

For *multi-band RIBs*, the requirement applies in addition inside any
*Inter RF Bandwidth gap*, in case the gap size is at least twice as wide
as the UTRA/E-UTRA interfering signal centre frequency offset from the
*Base Station RF Bandwidth* *edge*. The interfering signal offset is
defined relative to the *Base Station RF Bandwidth* *edges* inside the
*Inter RF Bandwidth gap*.

For the wanted signal at the assigned channel frequency and two
interfering signals at the RIB, using the parameters in tables
10.8.2.1-1 and 10.8.2.1-2, the following requirements shall be met:

\- For any E-UTRA carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95 % of the
*maximum throughput* of the reference measurement channel defined in
3GPP TS 36.104 \[8\], subclause 7.2.1.

\- For any UTRA FDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0,001 for the
reference measurement channel defined in 3GPP TS 25.104 \[6\], subclause
7.2.1.

\- For any NR carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channel defined for *BS type
1-O* in TS 38.104 \[28\], subclause 10.3.2

The OTA levels are applied referenced to 2 antenna gain offsets
Δ~OTAREFSENS~ and Δ~minSENS~.

#### 10.8.2.2 General narrowband intermodulation minimum requirement

Interfering signals shall be a CW signal and an E-UTRA 1RB signal as
specified in 3GPP TS 37.104 \[9\], annex A.

The requirement is applicable outside the *Base Station RF Bandwidth* or
*Radio Bandwidth*. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to
the *Base Station RF Bandwidth* *edges* or *Radio Bandwidth* edges.

For RIB supporting operation in *non-contiguous spectrum* within each
supported operating band, the requirement applies in addition inside any
*sub-block gap* in case the *sub-block gap* is at least as wide as the
*channel bandwidth* of the E-UTRA interfering signal in table
10.8.2.2-2. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the
*sub-block* edges inside the gap.

For *multi-band RIBs*, the requirement applies in addition inside any
*Inter RF Bandwidth gap,* in case the gap size is at least as wide as
the E-UTRA interfering signal in table 10.8.2.2-2. The interfering
signal offset is defined relative to the *Base Station RF Bandwidth*
*edges* inside the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*.

For the wanted signal at the assigned channel frequency and two
interfering signals at the RIB, using the parameters in tables
10.8.2.2-1 and 10.8.2.2-2, the following requirements shall be met:

\- For any E-UTRA carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95 % of the
*maximum throughput* of the reference measurement channel defined in
3GPP TS 36.104 \[8\], subclause 7.2.1.

\- For any UTRA FDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0,001 for the
reference measurement channel defined in 3GPP TS 25.104 \[6\], subclause
7.2.1.

\- For any NR carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channel defined in TS 38.104
\[17\], subclause 7.2.

The OTA levels are applied referenced to 2 antenna gain offsets
Δ~OTAREFSENS~ and Δ~minSENS~.

### 10.8.3 Minimum requirement for single RAT UTRA operation

The static reference performance as specified in subclause 10.3 and 10.2
shall be met for a Wide Area BS when the signals in table 10.8.3-1 and
table 10.8.3-2 are at the RIB.

The static reference performance as specified in subclause 10.3 and 10.2
shall be met for a Medium range BS when the signals in table 10.8.3-3
and table 10.8.3-4 are at the RIB.

The static reference performance as specified in subclause 10.3 and 10.2
shall be met for a Local Area BS when the signals in table 10.8.3-5 and
table 10.8.3-6 are at the RIB.

For RIB supporting operation in *non-contiguous spectrum* within each
supported operating band, the requirement applies in addition inside any
*sub-block gap* in case the *sub-block gap* is at least is at least
6.8MHz. The CW interfering signal offset is defined relative to the
lower/upper *sub-block* edge inside the *sub-block gap* and is equal to
-1MHz/+1MHz, respectively. The GMSK modulated interfering signal offset
is defined relative to the lower/upper *sub-block* edge inside the
*sub-block gap* and is equal to -3.4MHz/+3.4MHz, respectively.

For *multi-band RIBs*, the requirement applies in addition inside any
*Inter RF Bandwidth gap*, in case the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* size is
at least 6.8MHz. The CW interfering signal offset is defined relative to
lower/upper *Base Station RF Bandwidth edges* inside the *Inter RF
Bandwidth gap* and is equal to -1MHz/+1MHz, respectively. The GMSK
modulated interfering signal offset is defined relative to lower/upper
*Base Station RF Bandwidth edges* inside the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*
and is equal to -3.4MHz/+3.4MHz, respectively.

The OTA levels are applied referenced to 2 antenna gain offsets
Δ~OTAREFSENS~ and Δ~minSENS~.

### 10.8.4 Minimum requirement for single RAT E- UTRA operation

For E-UTRA, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the *maximum throughput* of
the reference measurement channel, with a wanted signal at the assigned
channel frequency and two interfering signals at the RIB, with the
conditions specified in tables 10.8.4-1 and 10.8.4-2 for intermodulation
performance and in tables 10.8.4-3, 10.8.4-4, and 10.8.4-5 for
narrowband intermodulation performance. Narrowband intermodulation
requirements are not applied for Band 46 nor for Band 49. The reference
measurement channel for the wanted signal is identified in
table 10.8.4-1 to 6 for each *channel bandwidth* and further specified
in 3GPP TS 36.104 \[8\] Annex A.

The receiver intermodulation requirement is applicable outside the *Base
Station RF Bandwidth* or *Radio Bandwidth edges*. The interfering signal
offset is defined relative to the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edges* or
*Radio Bandwidth edges*.

For RIB supporting operation in *non-contiguous spectrum* within each
supported operating band, the requirement applies in addition inside any
*sub-block gap* in case the *sub-block gap* is at least as wide as the
*channel bandwidth* of the E-UTRA interfering signal in table 10.8.4-3.
The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the *sub-block*
edges inside the *sub-block gap*.

For *multi-band RIBs*, the intermodulation requirement applies in
addition inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap,* in case the gap size is at
least as wide as the E-UTRA interfering signal centre frequency offset
from the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edge*.

For *multi-band RIBs*, the narrowband intermodulation requirement
applies in addition inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap,* in case the gap
size is at least as wide as the E-UTRA interfering signal in tables
10.8.4-3, 10.8.4-4 and 10.8.4-5. The interfering signal offset is
defined relative to the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edges* inside the
*Inter RF Bandwidth gap*.

The OTA levels are applied referenced to 2 antenna gain offsets
Δ~OTAREFSENS~ and Δ~minSENS~.

10.9 OTA In-channel selectivity
-------------------------------

### 10.9.1 General

In-channel selectivity (ICS) is a measure of the receiver unit ability
to receive a wanted signal at its assigned resource block locations in
the presence of an interfering signal received at a larger power
spectral density. In this condition a throughput requirement shall be
met for a specified reference measurement channel.

The requirement applies at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave of
a received signal and the interfering signal are from the same direction
and are within the *minSENS RoAoA*.

The wanted and interfering signals apply to each supported polarization,
under the assumption of *polarization match*.

### 10.9.2 Minimum requirement for MSR operation

For E-UTRA, the minimum requirement for in-channel selectivity is
specified in subclause 10.9.4.

For NR, the minimum requirement for in channel selecitivity is the same
as that specified for *BS type 1-O* in 3GPP TS 38.104 \[28\] in
subclause 10.9.2

This requirement is not applicable for UTRA operation.

### 10.9.3 Minimum requirement for single RAT UTRA operation

This requirement is not applicable for UTRA BS.

### 10.9.4 Minimum requirement for single RAT E- UTRA operation

For E-UTRA, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the *maximum throughput* of
the reference measurement channel as specified in 3GPP 36.104 \[8\]
Annex A with parameters specified in table 10.9.4-1 for Wide Area BS, in
table 10.9.4-2 for Local Area BS and in table 10.9.4-3 for Medium Range
BS.

The OTA levels are applied referenced to Δ~minSENS~.

11 Radiated performance requirements
====================================

11.1 General
------------

### 11.1.1 OTA demodulation branches

OTA performance requirements are only specified for up to 2
*demodulation branches.*

If the OTA AAS BS uses polarization diversity and has the ability to
maintain isolation between the signals for each of the *demodulation
branches*, then OTA performance requirements can be tested for up to two
*demodulation branches*. When tested for two *demodulation branches*,
each demodulation branch maps to one polarization.

If the OTA AAS BS does not use polarization diversity then OTA
performance requirements can only be tested for a single *demodulation
branch.*

### 11.1.2 UTRA operation

Performance requirements for *single RAT UTRA operation* in FDD are
specified for the measurement channels defined in 3GPP TS 25.104 \[2\].
The requirements only apply to those measurement channels that are
supported by AAS BS. For FRC8 in 3GPP TS 25.104 \[2\] the non E-DPCCH
boosting and E-DPCCH boosting requirement only apply for the option
supported by the AAS BS. The performance requirements for the high speed
train scenarios defined in 3GPP TS 25.104 \[2\] are optional.

Unless stated otherwise, performance requirements apply for a single
cell only. Performance requirements for an AAS BS supporting UTRA FDD
DC-HSUPA or DB-DC-HSUPA and UTRA TDD MC\_HSUPA are defined in terms of
single carrier requirements. For FDD operation the requirements in
clause 11 shall be met with the transmitter unit(s) associated with the
RIB in the operating band ON.

NOTE: In normal operating conditions the *transceiver units* in UTRA FDD
operation are configured to transmit and receive at the same time. The
transmitter unit(s) associated with the RIB may be OFF for some of the
tests as specified in 3GPP TS 37.145 \[13\].

In the referred UTRA specifications and in this clause, the term BS with
RX diversity refers to performance requirements for two *demodulation
branches*, and BS without RX diversity refers to performance
requirements for one *demodulation branch*.

For AAS BS with RX diversity, only the BS performance requirements with
RX diversity apply, the required E~b~/N~0~ for UTRA FDD and Î~or~/I~oc~
for UTRA TDD shall be applied separately for each *demodulation branch*.

For AAS BS without RX diversity, only the BS performance requirements
without RX diversity apply. The required E~b~/N~0~ for UTRA FDD and
Î~or~/I~oc~ for UTRA TDD shall be applied for each AAS BS *demodulation
branch*.

The E~b~/N~0~ used for UTRA FDD is defined as:

Where:

is the received total energy of DPDCH, DPCCH, S-DPCCH, HS-DPCCH,
E-DPDCH, S-E-DPDCH, E-DPCCH and S-E-DPCCH per PN chip per *demodulation
branch* from all branches

is the total one-sided noise power spectral density due to all noise
sources

is the number of chips per frame

is the number of information bits in DTCH excluding CRC bits per frame

UTRA operation

### 11.1.3 E-UTRA operation

Performance requirements for the AAS BS are specified for the fixed
reference channels (FRC) and propagation conditions defined in 3GPP TS
36.104 \[8\] annex A and annex B, respectively. The requirements only
apply to those FRCs that are supported by the AAS BS.

Unless stated otherwise, performance requirements apply for a single
carrier only. Performance requirements for an AAS BS E-UTRA supporting
*carrier aggregation* are defined in terms of single carrier
requirements. For FDD operation the requirements shall be met with the
transmitter unit(s) associated with the RIB in the operating band ON.

NOTE: In normal operating conditions the *transceiver units* in FDD
operation are configured to transmit and receive at the same time. The
transmitter unit(s) associated with the RIB may be OFF for some of the
tests as specified in 3GPP TS 37.145 \[13\].

In the referred E-UTRA specification, the term \"RX antennas\" refers to
*demodulation branches* (and not physical antennas).

The SNR used in this clause is specified based on a single carrier and
defined as:

SNR = S / N

Where:

S is the total signal energy in the subframe.

N is the noise energy in a bandwidth corresponding to the *transmission
bandwidth* over the duration of a subframe.

For enhanced performance requirements type A, the SINR used in this
clause is specified based on a single carrier and defined as:

Where:

is the total signal energy in the subframe.

is the summation of the received energy of the strongest interferers
explicitly defined in a test procedure plus the white noise energy *N*,
in a bandwidth corresponding to the *transmission bandwidth* over the
duration of a subframe. The respective energy of each interferer
relative to is defined by its associated DIP value.

11.2 Minimum requirements for MSR operation
-------------------------------------------

For *single RAT UTRA operation*, minimum requirements for demodulation
performance are specified in subclause 8.3.

For *single RAT E-UTRA operation*, minimum requirements for demodulation
performance are specified in subclause 8.4.

11.3 Minimum requirements for UTRA operation
--------------------------------------------

The *single RAT UTRA operation* in FDD shall fulfil all mandatory BS
demodulation performance requirements specified in subclauses 8.2 to
8.12 of 3GPP TS 25.104 \[6\].

In the referred UTRA specifications, the term BS with RX diversity
refers to performance requirements for two *demodulation branches*, and
BS without RX diversity refers to performance requirements for one
*demodulation branch*.

11.4 Minimum requirements for E-UTRA operation 
----------------------------------------------

The *single RAT E-UTRA operation* shall fulfil all mandatory BS
demodulation performance requirements specified in subclauses 8.2 - 8.4
(for PUSCH, PUCCH and PRACH) and 8.6 -- 8.7 (for subslot-PUSCH and
sPUCCH) of TS 36.104 \[8\].

In the referred E-UTRA specification, the term \"RX antennas\" refers to
*demodulation branches* (i.e. not physical antennas).

########  Annex A (normative): Environmental requirements for the BS equipment

The AAS BS equipment shall fulfil all the requirements in the full range
of environmental conditions for the relevant environmental class. The
environmental conditions and class shall be from the relevant IEC
specifications or the corresponding ETSI specifications listed below.

IEC specifications for environmental requirements:

IEC 60721-3-3 \[21\]: \"Stationary use at weather protected locations\".

IEC 60721-3-4 \[22\]: \"Stationary use at non weather protected
locations\".

ETSI specifications for environmental requirements:

ETSI EN 300 019-1-3 \[23\]: \"Stationary use at weather protected
locations\".

ETSI EN 300 019-1-4 \[24\]: \"Stationary use at non weather protected
locations\".

Normally it should be sufficient for all tests to be conducted using
normal test conditions except where otherwise stated. For guidance on
the use of test conditions to be used in order to show compliance refer
to TS 37.145-1 \[29\] or TS 37.145-2 \[30\].

######## Annex B (Informative): Calculation of EIRP based on fixed assumption of passive antenna gain

B.1 Calculation of EIRP based on fixed assumption of passive antenna gain
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some regional requirements are defined per effective isotropic radiated
power (EIRP), which is a combination of the transmitted power (or in
some cases spectral density) and the effective antenna gain which is a
site specific condition. Such requirements may be applied per antenna,
per cell, or per base station. It shall be noted that the definition of
BS or cell may differ between regulations. Where the regulator
prescribes a method for EIRP calculation, that method supersedes the
proposed assessment in this annex.

The regulations set an EIRP limit considering a passive antenna BS.
Although the gain of passive antennas may vary somewhat, the gain
variation is in the order of a few dBs. The instantaneous gain of an AAS
BS may be much larger. However AAS unwanted emissions requirements are
defined as TRP, since TRP impacts co-existence properties.

In order to relate the EIRP values in the specifications to TRP, a fixed
assumption has been made on the gain of a typical passive BS antenna.

Thus, the maximum TRP can be estimated using the following formulas:

> TRP limit per antenna: P~TRP,\ antenna~ = P~EIRP~ - G~Ant~
>
> E-UTRA TRP limit per cell or per BS: P~TRP~ =P~TRP,antenna~ + 9dB
>
> UTRA TRP limit per cell or per BS: P~TRP~ =P~TRP,antenna~ + 6dB

It is noted that the AAS architecture assumes that a BS subject to OTA
requirements will have at least 8 antennas.

In case the TRP requirement is set per polarisation, the summation shall
be made per polarisation.

\"P~EIRP~\" is the effective isotropic radiated power (or radiated power
spectral density) set in the regulation (assuming a passive BS antenna)
in dBm (or dBm/measurement BW).

\"G~Ant~\" is the effective antenna gain, the antenna gain (dBi) is a
fixed reference value of 17 dBi. Directivity value should be used in
above equations, however with all antenna losses are assumed zero then
we can use effective antenna gain.
