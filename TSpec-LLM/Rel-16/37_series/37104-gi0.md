 Foreword
========

This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:

**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something

**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something

The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the
context of normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.

The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes
for \"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as
possible, and they are not used in a normative context except in a
direct citation from an external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so
as to maintain continuity of style when extending or modifying the
provisions of such a referenced document.

**should** indicates a recommendation to do something

**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something

**may** indicates permission to do something

**need not** indicates permission not to do something

The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\"
are used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.

**can** indicates that something is possible

**cannot** indicates that something is impossible

The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\"
and \"need not\".

**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a
result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to
happen as a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which
is outside the scope of the present document

**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result
of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document

**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

In addition:

**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement
of fact

**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates
a statement of fact

The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

 1 Scope
=======

The present document establishes the minimum RF characteristics of NR,
E-UTRA, UTRA, GSM/EDGE and NB-IoT Multi-Standard Radio (MSR) Base

4 General
=========

4.1 Relation between the MSR specification and the single-RAT specifications
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The requirements for MSR are in most parts specified in the present
document, while many requirements are also specified through normative
references to the respective single-RAT specifications in \[2\], \[3\],
\[4\], \[5\] and \[17\]. The resulting set of requirements for an MSR BS
can be divided into three types, depending on their relation to the
single-RAT specifications:

1\. **Generic MSR requirement:** A common generic requirement is
specified in the present document that applies for all RATs and for BS
configured for both multi-RAT and single-RAT operation. In some cases,
there are additional requirement(s) that apply only in some Band
Category. There are no references to the single-RAT specifications.

2\. **Generic MSR requirement, with additional single-RAT
requirements:** A common generic requirement is specified in the present
document which applies as in point 1. In addition, some single RAT
requirement(s) apply, included by normative reference(s) to the
single-RAT specification(s).

3\. **Single-RAT only requirements:** In this case, no common generic
requirement is defined. The existing single-RAT requirement applies for
each RAT, included by normative reference(s) to the single-RAT
specification(s).

The applicability of each requirement is described in clause 5.

4.2 Relationship between minimum requirements and test requirements
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The Minimum Requirements given in this specification make no allowance
for measurement uncertainty. The test specification TS 37.141 \[10\]
defines Test Tolerances. These Test Tolerances are individually
calculated for each test. The Test Tolerances are used to relax the
Minimum Requirements in this specification to create Test Requirements.
For some requirements, including regulatory requirements, the test
tolerance is set to zero.

For MSR single-RAT requirements, the principle used to define the test
requirement remains from the existing specifications.

For both MSR single-RAT and multi-RAT requirements, the measurement
results returned by the Test System are compared - without any
modification - against the Test Requirements as defined by the shared
risk principle. The Shared Risk principle is defined in ITU-R M.1545
\[9\].

4.3 Base station classes
------------------------

The requirements in this specification apply to Wide Area Base Stations,
Medium Range Base Stations and Local Area Base Stations unless otherwise
stated.

Wide Area Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived from
Macro Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equal to 70
dB. The Wide Area Base Station class has the same requirements as the
base station for General Purpose application in Release 9 and 10.

Medium Range Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived
from Micro Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equals
to 53 dB.

Local Area Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived from
Pico Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equal to 45
dB.

For GSM/EDGE operation of an MSR BS, the requirements according to the
applicable multicarrier BTS class apply. The Wide Area BS, Medium Range
BS and Local Area BS in the present specification correspond to the Wide
Area multicarrier BTS, Medium Range multicarrier BTS and Local Area
multicarrier BTS respectively in the GSM/EDGE specifications. MSR
requirements for multi-RAT operation only apply for the highest GSM/EDGE
static power step.

4.4 Regional requirements
-------------------------

Some requirements in the present document may only apply in certain
regions either as optional requirements, or set by local and regional
regulation as mandatory requirements. It is normally not stated in the
3GPP specifications under what exact circumstances that the requirements
apply, since this is defined by local or regional regulation.

Table 4.4-1 lists all requirements in the present specification that may
be applied differently in different regions. There are additional
single-RAT regional requirements that may apply. These are referenced
from the present specification, but listed in the specification for the
RATs concerned \[2\]\[3\]\[4\]\[5\]\[17\].

4.5 Operating bands and Band Categories
---------------------------------------

MSR requirements are applicable for band definitions and band numbering
as defined in the specifications TS 45.005 \[5\], TS25.104 \[2\], TS
25.105 \[3\], TS 36.104 \[4\] and TS 38.104 \[17\]. For the purpose of
defining the BS requirements, the operating bands are divided into three
band categories as follows:

\- Band Category 1 (BC1): Bands for NR FDD, E-UTRA FDD and/or UTRA FDD
operation. Bands in this category are also used for NB-IoT operation
(all modes)

\- Band Category 2 (BC2): Bands for NR FDD, E-UTRA FDD, UTRA FDD and/or
GSM/EDGE operation. Bands in this category are also used for NB-IoT
operation (all modes)

\- Band Category 3 (BC3): Bands for NR TDD, E-UTRA TDD and/or UTRA TDD
operation. Bands in this category are also used for NB-IoT operation
(all modes)

NOTE: For UTRA TDD, requirements in the present document cover the
1.28 Mcps UTRA TDD option.

The paired and unpaired bands for the three Band Categories are shown in
Table 4.5-1 and 4.5-2, together with the supported RATs and
corresponding NR, E-UTRA, UTRA and GSM/EDGE band designations.

Table 4.5-1: Paired bands in NR, E-UTRA, UTRA and GSM/EDGE.

4.6 Channel arrangement
-----------------------

### 4.6.1 Channel spacing

The GSM/EDGE carrier spacing is 200 kHz \[5\].

The nominal UTRA FDD channel spacing is 5 MHz. The nominal channel
spacing is 1.6MHz for the 1.28 Mcps UTRA TDD Option. These can be
adjusted to optimise performance in a particular deployment scenario
\[2,3\].

In E-UTRA the spacing between carriers will depend on the deployment
scenario, the size of the frequency block available and the channel
bandwidths. The nominal channel spacing between two adjacent E-UTRA
carriers is defined as following:

Nominal Channel spacing = (BW~Channel(1)~ + BW~Channel(2)~)/2

where BW~Channel(1)~ and BW~Channel(2)~ are the channel bandwidths of
the two respective E-UTRA carriers. The channel spacing can be adjusted
to optimize performance in a particular deployment scenario \[4\].

The standalone NB-IoT carrier spacing is 200kHz.

In NR the spacing between carriers will depend on the deployment
scenario, the size of the frequency block available and the *BS channel
bandwidths*. The nominal channel spacing between two adjacent NR
carriers is defined as following:

\- For NR FR1 operating bands with 100 kHz channel raster,

Nominal Channel spacing = (BW~Channel(1)~ + BW~Channel(2)~)/2

\- For NR FR1 operating bands with 15 kHz channel raster,

\- Nominal Channel spacing = (BW~Channel(1)~ + BW~Channel(2)~)/2 + {-5
kHz, 0 kHz, 5 kHz} for ∆F~Raster~ equals to 15 kHz

\- Nominal Channel spacing = (BW~Channel(1)~ + BW~Channel(2)~)/2 + {-10
kHz, 0 kHz, 10 kHz} for ∆F~Raster~ equals to 30 kHz

where BW~Channel(1)~ and BW~Channel(2)~ are the *BS channel bandwidths*
of the two respective NR carriers. The channel spacing can be adjusted
depending on the channel raster to optimize performance in a particular
deployment scenario \[17\].

The spacing between E-UTRA and NR carriers will depend on the deployment
scenario, the size of the frequency block available and the channel
bandwidths. The nominal channel spacing between and E-UTRA carrier and
an adjacent NR carrier is defined as following:

\- For NR operating bands with 100 kHz channel raster,

Nominal Channel spacing = (BW~E-UTRA\_Channel~ + BW~NR\_Channel~)/2

\- For NR operating bands with 15 kHz channel raster,

Nominal Channel spacing = (BW~E-UTRA\_Channel~ +
BW~NR\_Channel~)/2+{-5kHz, 0kHz, 5kHz} for ∆F~Raster~ equals to 15 kHz

Nominal Channel spacing = (BW~E-UTRA\_Channel~ + BW~NR\_Channel~)/2+{-10
kHz, 0 kHz, 10 kHz} for ∆F~Raster~ equals to 30 kHz

where BW~E-UTRA\_Channel~ and BW~NR\_Channel~ are the channel bandwidths
of the E-UTRA and NR carriers, ∆F~Raster~ is the band dependent channel
raster granularity defined in TS38.101-1\[19\]. The channel spacing can
be adjusted depending on the channel raster to optimize performance in a
particular deployment scenario.

.

### 4.6.1A CA Channel spacing

In E-UTRA for contiguously aggregated carriers the channel spacing
between adjacent component carriers shall be multiple of 300 kHz.

The nominal channel spacing between two adjacent aggregated E-UTRA
carriers is defined as follows:

where BW~Channel(1)~ and BW~Channel(2)~ are the channel bandwidths of
the two respective E-UTRA component carriers according to Table 5.6-1
with values in MHz. The channel spacing for intra-band contiguous
carrier aggregation can be adjusted to any multiple of 300 kHz less than
the nominal channel spacing to optimize performance in a particular
deployment scenario.

In NR for intra-band contiguously aggregated carriers, the channel
spacing between adjacent component carriers shall be multiple of least
common multiple of channel raster and sub-carrier spacing.

The nominal channel spacing between two adjacent aggregated NR carriers
is defined as follows:

For NR operating bands with 100 kHz channel raster:

For NR operating bands with 15 kHz channel raster:

with

where BW~Channel(1)~ and BW~Channel(2)~ are the *BS channel bandwidths*
of the two respective NR component carriers according to Table 5.3.3-1
and 5.3.3-2 in TS 38.104 \[17\] with values in MHz, μ~0~ the largest μ
value among the subcarrier spacing configurations supported in the
operating band for both of the channel bandwidths according to Table
5.3.5-1 and Table 5.3.5-2 in TS 38.104 \[17\] and *GB~Channel(i)~* the
minimum guard band for channel bandwidth *i* according to Table 5.3.3-1
and Table 5.3.3-2 in TS 38.104 \[17\] for the said μ value, with μ as
defined in TS 38.211. In case there is no common μ value for both of the
channel bandwidths, μ~0~=1 is selected for NR *operating bands* with 15
kHz channel raster and *GB~Channel(i)~* is the minimum guard band for
channel bandwidth i according to Table 5.3.3-1 in TS38.104 \[17\] for
*μ=1* with *μ* as defined in TS 38.211.

In NR the channel spacing for intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation
can be adjusted to any multiple of least common multiple of channel
raster and sub-carrier spacing less than the nominal channel spacing to
optimize performance in a particular deployment scenario.

### 4.6.2 Channel raster

The GSM/EDGE channel raster is 200 kHz for all bands \[5\].

The UTRA FDD and TDD channel raster is 200 kHz for all bands, which
means that the centre frequency must be an integer multiple of 200 kHz.
In addition, a number of additional centre frequencies are specified for
UTRA FDD according to \[2\], which means that the centre frequencies for
UTRA FDD channels are shifted 100 kHz relative to the general raster.

The E-UTRA channel raster is 100 kHz for all bands, which means that the
carrier centre frequency must be an integer multiple of 100 kHz \[4\].

NB-IoT channel raster is 100 kHz for all bands \[4\].

NR channel raster is specified in Clause 5.4.2 of TS 38.104 \[17\].

### 4.6.3 Carrier frequencies and numbering

The carrier frequencies and corresponding numbering is defined for each
RAT in the respective specifications TS 38.104 \[17\], 36.104 \[4\]
TS25.104 \[2\], TS 25.105 \[3\] and TS 45.005 \[5\]. In the context of
MSR, the frequency numbering scheme for each RAT will remain.

\- The E-UTRA carrier frequency numbering (EARFCN) is defined in
subclause 5.7 of TS 36.104 \[4\].

\- The UTRA FDD carrier frequency numbering (UARFCN) is defined in
subclause 5.4 of TS 25.104 \[2\].

\- The UTRA TDD carrier frequency numbering (UARFCN) is defined in
subclause 5.4 of TS 25.105 \[3\].

\- The GSM/EDGE carrier frequency numbering (ARFCN) is defined subclause
2 of TS 45.005 \[5\].

\- The NB-IoT carrier frequency numbering (EARFCN) is defined in
subclause 5.7 of TS 36.104 \[4\].

\- The NR carrier frequency numbering (NR-ARFCN) is defined in subclause
5.4.2.3 of TS 38.104 \[17\].

NOTE: The numbering schemes for UTRA FDD and TDD are not coordinated,
while both are called UARFCN.

4.7 Requirements for contiguous and non-contiguous spectrum
-----------------------------------------------------------

A spectrum allocation where an MSR BS operates can either be contiguous
or non-contiguous. Unless otherwise stated, the requirements in the
present specification apply for BS configured for both contiguous
spectrum operation and non-contiguous spectrum operation.

For MSR BS operation in non-contiguous spectrum, some requirements apply
both at the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges and inside the sub-block
gaps. For each such requirement, it is stated how the limits apply
relative to the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges and the sub-block edges
respectively.

4.8 Requirements for BS capable of multi-band operation
-------------------------------------------------------

For BS capable of multi-band operation (for NR this refers to BS type
1-C with a multi-band antenna connector), the RF requirements in clause
6 and 7 apply for each supported operating band unless otherwise stated.
For some requirements it is explicitly stated that specific additions or
exclusions to the requirement apply for BS capable of multi-band
operation. In the case of multiband operation of a BS, single-RAT
operation and the corresponding applicability of the requirements for
each operating band is determined based on the RAT configuration within
only that operating band, unless otherwise stated. A BS may operate
multi-RAT where the individual RATs are operated in different RAT
specific bands that partially or fully overlap; Δf~OBUE~ and Δf~OOB~ are
according to the combined frequency range occupied by the overlapping
bands.

For BS capable of multi-band operation, various structures in terms of
combinations of different transmitter and receiver implementations
(multi-band or single band) with mapping of transceivers to one or more
antenna port(s) in different ways are possible. In the case where
multiple bands are mapped on an antenna connector, the exclusions or
provisions for multi-band capable BS are applicable to this antenna
connector. In the case where a single band is mapped on an antenna
connector, the following applies:

\- Single-band transmitter spurious emissions, operating band unwanted
emissions, ACLR, transmitter intermodulation and receiver spurious
emissions requirements apply to this antenna connector that is mapped to
single-band.

\- If the BS is configured for single-band operation, single-band
requirements shall apply to this antenna connector configured for
single-band operation and no exclusions or provisions for multi-band
capable BS are applicable. Single-band requirements are tested
separately at the antenna connector configured for single-band
operation, with all other antenna connectors terminated.

For a band supported by a Base Station where the transmitted carriers
are not processed in active RF components together with carriers in any
other band, single-band transmitter requirements shall apply. For a band
supported by a Base Station where the received carriers are not
processed in active RF components together with carriers in any other
band, single-band receiver requirements shall apply.

For a BS capable of multi-band operation supporting BC3 bands for TDD,
the RF requirements in the present specification assume synchronized
operation, where no simultaneous uplink and downlink occur between the
bands.

The RF requirements for multi-band operation supporting bands for both
FDD and TDD are not covered by the present release of this
specification.

5 Applicability of requirements
===============================

5.1 Band category 1
-------------------

For all BS operating in bands belonging to Band Category 1, the RF
requirements listed in Table 5.1-1 apply for each supported operating
band. Requirements apply according to the RAT configuration of the Base
Station, as listed in the heading of the table. Some requirements listed
in the table may not be mandatory or they may apply only regionally.
This is further specified in the clause of each requirement and in Table
4.4-1. For multiband operation, the applicability of the requirements
for each operating band is determined based on the RAT configuration
within only that operating band, unless otherwise stated.

5.2 Band category 2
-------------------

For all BS operating in bands belonging to Band Category 2, the RF
requirements listed in Table 5.2-1 apply for each supported operating
band. Requirements apply according to the RAT configuration of the Base
Station, as listed in the heading of the table. Some requirements listed
in the table may not be mandatory or they may apply only regionally.
This is further specified in the clause of each requirement and in Table
4.4-1. For multiband operation, the applicability of the requirements
for each operating band is determined based on the RAT configuration
within only that operating band, unless otherwise stated.

Category 2

5.4 Inclusion of requirements by reference
------------------------------------------

Many requirements in the present specification are not explicitly stated
in the clauses listed in Tables 5.1-1, 5.2-1 and 5.3-1, but are instead
included by reference to the respective single-RAT specifications. Each
reference is normative and identifies the clause where the requirement
is specified.

In some cases, the referenced clause may contain requirements that for
different reasons do not apply for an MSR base station. It is in those
cases stated that \"applicable parts of\" the referenced clause applies.
What parts are applicable is determined by the scope of the MSR
specification. For example:

\- In a referenced clause including requirements for multiple operating
bands, only requirements for bands listed in the present document apply.

\- In a referenced clause that includes requirements for different types
of base stations, only requirements for the BS classes specified for
each RAT apply, see subclause 4.3.

6 Transmitter characteristics
=============================

6.1 General
-----------

Unless otherwise stated, the requirements in clause 6 are expressed for
a single transmitter antenna connector. In case of multi-carrier
transmission with multiple transmitter antenna connectors, transmit
diversity, DB-DC-HSDPA or MIMO transmission, the requirements apply for
each transmitter antenna connector.

A BS supporting DC-HSDPA and DB-DC-HSDPA transmits two UTRA FDD cells
simultaneously. A BS supporting DC-HSDPA transmits two UTRA FDD cells
simultaneously on adjacent carrier frequencies.

Unless otherwise stated, the transmitter characteristics are specified
at the BS antenna connector (test port A) with a full complement of
transceivers for the configuration in normal operating conditions. If
any external apparatus such as a TX amplifier, a filter or the
combination of such devices is used, requirements apply at the far end
antenna connector (test port B).

Unless otherwise stated the requirements in subclause 6 applies at all
times, i.e. during the Transmitter ON period, the Transmitter OFF period
and the Transmitter transient period.

Figure 6.1-1: Transmitter test ports

Values for **F~offset,\ RAT~** to meet transmitter requirements are
specific for each RAT in each Band Category as specified in subclause
4.5.1 for Band Category 1, subclause 4.5.2 for Band Category 2 and
subclause 4.5.3 for Band Category 3.

Unless otherwise stated the requirements for NB-IoT in subclause 6
applies for all operation modes (In-band operation, Guard-band operation
and Stand-alone operation).

6.2 Base station output power
-----------------------------

Output power of the base station is the mean power delivered to a load
with resistance equal to the nominal load impedance of the transmitter.

The configured carrier power is the target maximum power for a specific
carrier for the operating mode set in the BS within the limits given by
the manufacturer\'s declaration.

The maximum total output power, P~max~, of the base station is the mean
power level measured at the antenna connector during the transmitter ON
period in a specified reference condition.

The maximum RAT output power, P~max,RAT~, of the base station is the
mean power level measured at the antenna connector during the
transmitter ON period for a specific RAT in a specified reference
condition.

The maximum carrier output power, P~max,c~ of the base station is the
mean power level measured at the antenna connector during the
transmitter ON period for a specific carrier in a specified reference
condition.

The rated carrier output power, P~Rated,c~, of the base station is the
mean power level for a specific carrier that the manufacturer has
declared to be available at the antenna connector during the transmitter
ON period.

NOTE: For NB-IoT in-band and guard band operation, the LTE carrier and
NB-IoT carrier shall be seen as a single carrier occupied LTE channel
bandwidth, the output power over this carrier is shared between LTE and
NB-IoT. For *NB-IoT operation in NR in-band*, the NR carrier and NB-IoT
carrier shall be seen as a single carrier occupied NR channel bandwidth,
the output power over this carrier is shared between NR and NB-IoT. This
note is applied for Pout, Rated total output power, Pmax,c and Prated,c.

The rated carrier output power of the BS shall be as specified in Table
6.2-1.

Table 6.2-1 Base Station rated carrier output power

  BS class                                                                                          P~Rated,c~

  NOTE: There is no upper limit for the rated carrier output power of the Wide Area Base Station.   

In addition, for Band 85 NB-IoT standalone operation, the BS rated
output power limit of 43 dBm applies over the NB-IoT carriers in the
range 728-729 MHz of the DL operating band. The BS output power limit of
43 dBm shall be considered as shared among all NB-IoT carriers in the
728-729 MHz frequency range or as the maximum value per NB-IoT carrier
in the case where only one NB-IoT carrier is deployed in 728-729 MHz
frequency range.

### 6.2.1 Minimum requirement

In normal conditions, the maximum carrier output power shall remain
within +2 dB and -2 dB of the configured carrier power declared by the

6.6 Unwanted emissions
----------------------

Unwanted emissions consist of out-of-band emissions and spurious
emissions \[6\]. Out of band emissions are unwanted emissions
immediately outside the channel bandwidth resulting from the modulation
process and non-linearity in the transmitter but excluding spurious
emissions. Spurious emissions are emissions which are caused by unwanted
transmitter effects such as harmonics emission, parasitic emission,
intermodulation products and frequency conversion products, but exclude
out of band emissions.

The out-of-band emissions requirement for the BS transmitter is
specified in terms of an Operating band unwanted emissions requirement
that defines limits for emissions in each supported downlink operating
band plus the frequency ranges Δf~OBUE~ above and Δf~OBUE~ below each
band. Emissions outside of this frequency range are limited by a
spurious emissions requirement. The values of Δf~OBUE~ are defined in
table 6.6-1.

Table 6.6-1: Maximum offset of OBUE outside the downlink operating band

  Operating band characteristics                   Δf~OBUE~ \[MHz\]
  ------------------------------------------------ ------------------
  F~DL\_high~ -- F~DL\_low~ ≤ 200 MHz              10
  200 MHz \< F~DL\_high~ -- F~DL\_low~ ≤ 900 MHz   40

There is in addition a requirement for occupied bandwidth and an ACLR
requirement applicable for some RATs.

### 6.6.1 Transmitter spurious emissions

The transmitter spurious emission limits apply from 9 kHz to 12.75 GHz,
excluding the frequency range from Δf~OBUE~ below the lowest frequency
of the downlink operating band up to Δf~OBUE~ above the highest
frequency of the downlink operating band. For BS capable of multi-band
operation where multiple bands are mapped on the same antenna connector,
this exclusion applies for each supported operating band. For BS capable
of multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped on separate
antenna connectors, the single-band requirements apply and the
multi-band exclusions and provisions are not applicable.

Exceptions are the requirements in Table 6.6.1.3.1-2 and specifically
stated exceptions in Table 6.6.1.3.1-1 that apply also closer than
Δf~OBUE~ from the downlink operating band. For some operating bands the
upper frequency limit is higher than 12.75 GHz.

The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter
considered. It applies for all transmission modes foreseen by the
manufacturer\'s specification. Unless otherwise stated, all requirements
are measured as mean power (RMS).

#### 6.6.1.1 Mandatory Requirements

The requirements of either subclause 6.6.1.1.1 (Category A limits) or
subclause 6.6.1.1.2 (Category B limits) shall apply. In addition, for a
BS operating in Band Category 2, the requirements of 6.6.1.1.3 shall
apply in case of Category B limits when GSM/EDGE is configured.

##### 6.6.1.1.1 Minimum requirement (Category A)

  Note 1: For E-UTRA Band 28 BS operating in regions where Band 28 is only partially allocated for E-UTRA operations, this requirement only applies in the UL frequency range of the partial allocation.                                                                                       

#### 6.6.1.3 Additional spurious emissions requirements

These requirements may be applied for the protection of system operating
in frequency ranges other than the BS downlink operating band. The
limits may apply as an optional protection of such systems that are
deployed in the same geographical area as the BS, or they may be set by
local or regional regulation as a mandatory requirement for an operating
band. It is in some cases not stated in the present document whether a
requirement is mandatory or under what exact circumstances that a limit
applies, since this is set by local or regional regulation. An overview
of regional requirements in the present document is given in subclause
4.4.

Some requirements may apply for the protection of specific equipment
(UE, MS and/or BS) or equipment operating in specific systems (GSM/EDGE,
CDMA, UTRA, E-UTRA, NR, etc.) as listed below.

##### 6.6.1.3.1 Minimum Requirement

The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits of Table
6.6.1.3.1-1 for a BS where requirements for co-existence with the system
listed in the first column apply. For BS capable of multi-band
operation, the exclusions and conditions in the Note column of Table
6.6.1.3.1-1 apply for each supported operating band. For BS capable of
multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped on separate antenna
connectors, the exclusions and conditions in the Note column of Table
6.6.1.3.1-1 apply for the operating band supported at that antenna
connector.

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this
subclause, except for the cases where the noted requirements apply to a
BS operating in Band 25, Band 27, Band 28 or Band 29, the co-existence
requirements in Table 6.6.1.3.1-1 do not apply for the 10 MHz frequency
range immediately outside the downlink operating band (see Tables 4.5-1
and 4.5-2). Emission limits for this excluded frequency range may be
covered by local or regional requirements.

NOTE 2: Table 6.6.1.3.1-1 assumes that two operating bands, where the
frequency ranges in Table 4.5-1 or Table 4.5-2 would be overlapping, are
not deployed in the same geographical area. For such a case of operation
with overlapping frequency arrangements in the same geographical area,
special co-existence requirements may apply that are not covered by the
3GPP specifications.

NOTE 3: For the protection of DCS1800, UTRA Band III, E-UTRA Band 3 or
NR Band n3 in China, the frequency ranges of the downlink and uplink
protection requirements are 1805 -- 1850 MHz and 1710 -- 1755 MHz
respectively.

NOTE 4: TDD base stations deployed in the same geographical area, that
are synchronized and use the same or adjacent operating bands can
transmit without additional co-existence requirements. For
unsynchronized base stations (except in Band 46), special co-existence
requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.

NOTE 6: For Band 28 BS, specific solutions may be required to fulfil the
spurious emissions limits for BS for co-existence with Band 27 UL
operating band.

NOTE 7: For Band 29 BS, specific solutions may be required to fulfil the
spurious emissions limits for BS for co-existence with UTRA Band XII or
E-UTRA Band 12 or NR Band n12 UL operating band or E-UTRA Band 17 UL
operating band or E-UTRA Band 85 UL operating band.

The following requirement may be applied for the protection of PHS. This
requirement is also applicable at specified frequencies falling between
Δf~OBUE~ below the lowest BS transmitter frequency of the downlink
operating band and Δf~OBUE~ above the highest BS transmitter frequency
of the downlink operating band.

The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:

Table 6.6.1.3.1-2: BS Spurious emissions limits for BS for co-existence
with PHS

  NOTE: The requirement is not applicable in China.                                           

The following requirement may apply to BS operating in Band 41 in
certain regions. This requirement is also applicable at the frequency
range from Δf~OBUE~ below the lowest frequency of the BS downlink
operating band up to Δf~OBUE~ above the highest frequency of the BS
downlink operating band.

For Band 41 NR operation in Japan, the operating band unwanted emissions
limits shall be applied to the sum of the emission power over all
*antenna connectors.*

The following requirement may apply to BS operating in Band 30 in
certain regions. This requirement is also applicable at the frequency
range from 10 MHz below the lowest frequency of the BS downlink
operating band up to 10 MHz above the highest frequency of the BS
downlink operating band.

+----------------+---------------+----------------+----------------+

In addition to the requirements in subclauses 6.6.1.1, 6.6.1.2 and above
in the present subclause, the BS may have to comply with the applicable
emission limits established by FCC Title 47 \[8\], when deployed in
regions where those limits are applied, and under the conditions
declared by the manufacturer.

#### 6.6.1.4 Co-location with other base stations

These requirements may be applied for the protection of other BS
receivers when GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850, CDMA850, UTRA FDD, UTRA
TDD, E-UTRA, NB-IoT and/or NR BS are co-located with a BS.

The requirements assume a 30 dB coupling loss between transmitter and
receiver and are based on co-location with base stations of the same
class.

NOTE: For co-location with UTRA, the requirements are based on
co-location with UTRA FDD or TDD base stations.

##### 6.6.1.4.1 Minimum Requirement

The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits of Table
6.6.1.4.1-1 for a BS where requirements for co-location with a BS type
listed in the first column apply, depending on the declared Base Station
class. For BS capable of multi-band operation, the exclusions and
conditions in the Note column of Table 6.6.1.4.1-1 apply for each
supported operating band. For BS capable of multi-band operation where
multiple bands are mapped on separate antenna connectors, the exclusions
and conditions in the Note column of Table 6.6.1.4.1-1 apply for the
operating band supported at that antenna connector.

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this
subclause, the co-location requirements in Table 6.6.1.4.1-1 do not
apply for the Δf~OBUE~ frequency range immediately outside the BS
transmit frequency range of a downlink operating band (see Tables 4.5-1
and 4.5-2). The current state-of-the-art technology does not allow a
single generic solution for co-location with other system on adjacent
frequencies for 30 dB BS-BS minimum coupling loss. However, there are
certain site-engineering solutions that can be used. These techniques
are addressed in TR 25.942 \[7\].

NOTE 2: Table 6.6.1.4.1-1 assumes that two operating bands, where the
corresponding BS transmit and receive frequency ranges in Table 4.5-1 or
Table 4.5-2 would be overlapping, are not deployed in the same
geographical area. For such a case of operation with overlapping
frequency arrangements in the same geographical area, special
co-location requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP
specifications.

NOTE 3: Co-located TDD base stations that are synchronized and using the
same or adjacent operating band can transmit without special
co-locations requirements. For unsynchronized base stations, special
co-location requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP
specifications.

### 6.6.2 Operating band unwanted emissions 

Unless otherwise stated, the Operating band unwanted emission limits are
defined from Δf~OBUE~ below the lowest frequency of each supported
downlink operating band to the lower Base Station RF Bandwidth edge
located at F~BW\ RF,low~ and from the upper Base Station RF Bandwidth
edge located at F~BW\ RF,high~ up to Δf~OBUE~ above the highest
frequency of each supported downlink operating band. The values of
Δf~OBUE~ are defined in table 6.6-1.The requirements shall apply
whatever the type of transmitter considered and for all transmission
modes foreseen by the manufacturer\'s specification, except for any
operating band with GSM/EDGE single RAT operation. The requirements in
TS 45.005 \[5\] as defined in subclause 6.6.2.3 apply to an MSR Base
Station for any operating band with GSM/EDGE single RAT operation in
Band Category 2.

For BS capable of multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped
on separate antenna connectors, the single-band requirements apply and
the cumulative evaluation of the emission limit in the Inter-RF
Bandwidth gap are not applicable.

#### 6.6.2.1 General minimum requirement for Band Categories 1 and 3

For a Wide Area BS operating in Band Category 1 or Band Category 3 the
requirement applies outside the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges. In
addition, for a Wide Area BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum, it
applies inside any sub-block gap. In addition, for a Wide Area BS
operating in multiple bands, the requirements apply inside any Inter RF
Bandwidth gap.

For a Medium Range BS operating in Band Category 1 the requirement
applies outside the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges. In addition, for a
Medium Range BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum, it applies inside
any sub-block gap. In addition, for a Medium Range BS operating in
multiple bands, the requirements apply inside any Inter RF Bandwidth
gap.

For a Local Area BS operating in Band Category 1 the requirement applies
outside the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges. In addition, for a Local
Area BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum, it applies inside any
sub-block gap. In addition, for a Local Area BS operating in multiple
bands, the requirements apply inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap.

Outside the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges, emissions shall not exceed
the maximum levels specified in Tables 6.6.2.1-1 to 6.6.2.1-4 below,
where:

\- ∆f is the separation between the Base Station RF Bandwidth edge
frequency and the nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to
the carrier frequency.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the Base Station RF Bandwidth
edge frequency and the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is the offset to the frequency Δf~OBUE~ outside the
downlink operating band.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

For a BS operating in multiple bands, inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gaps
with Wgap \< 2\*Δf~OBUE~, emissions shall not exceed the cumulative sum
of the minimum requirements specified at the Base Station RF Bandwidth
edges on each side of the Inter-RF Bandwidth gap. The minimum
requirement for Base Station RF Bandwidth edge is specified in Table
6.6.2.1-1 to 6.6.2.1-4 below, where in this case:

\- ∆f is the separation between the Base Station RF Bandwidth edge
frequency and the nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to
the carrier frequency.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the Base Station RF Bandwidth
edge frequency and the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is equal to the inter Base Station RF Bandwidth gap
minus half of the bandwidth of the measuring filter.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offsetmax minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

For BS capable of multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped
on the same antenna connector, the operating band unwanted emission
limits apply also in a supported operating band without any carriers
transmitted, in the case where there are carriers transmitted in other
operating band(s). In this case where there is no carrier transmitted in
an operating band, the operating band unwanted emission limit, as
defined in the tables of the present subclause for the largest frequency
offset (∆f~max~), of a band where there is no carrier transmitted shall
apply from Δf~OBUE~ below the lowest frequency, up to Δf~OBUE~ above the
highest frequency of the supported downlink operating band without any
carrier transmitted. And no cumulative limits are applied in the
inter-band gap between a supported downlink band with carrier(s)
transmitted and a supported downlink band without any carrier
transmitted.

Inside any sub-block gap for a BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum,
emissions shall not exceed the cumulative sum of the minimum
requirements specified for the adjacent sub blocks on each side of the
sub block gap. The minimum requirement for each sub block is specified
in Tables 6.6.2.1-1 to 6.6.2.1-4 below, where in this case:

\- ∆f is the separation between the sub block edge frequency and the
nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to the sub block
edge.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the sub block edge frequency and
the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is equal to the sub block gap bandwidth minus half of
the bandwidth of the measuring filter.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

For Band 41 NR operation in Japan, the operating band unwanted emissions
limits shall be applied to the sum of the emission power over all
*antenna connectors.*

Applicability of Wide Area operating band unwanted emission requirements
in Tables 6.6.2.1-1, 6.6.2.1-1b and 6.6.2.1-1c is specified in Table
6.6.2.1-0.

Note: Option 1 and Option 2 correspond to the Category B option 1/2
operating band unwanted emissions defined in the E-UTRA and NR
specifications TS 36.104 \[4\] and TS 38.104 \[17\]. Option 2 also
corresponds to the UTRA spectrum emission mask as defined in TS 25.104
\[2\].

#### 6.6.2.2 General minimum requirement for Band Category 2

For a BS operating in Band Category 2 the requirement applies outside
the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges. In addition, for a BS operating in
non-contiguous spectrum, it applies inside any sub-block gap.

Outside the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges, emissions shall not exceed
the maximum levels specified in Tables 6.6.2.2-1 to 6.6.2.2-8 below,
where:

\- ∆f is the separation between the Base Station RF Bandwidth edge
frequency and the nominal -3dB point of the measuring filter closest to
the carrier frequency.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the Base Station RF Bandwidth
edge frequency and the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is the offset to the frequency Δf~OBUE~ outside the
downlink operating band.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

For a BS operating in multiple bands, inside any Inter-RF Bandwidth gaps
with Wgap \< 2\*Δf~OBUE~, emissions shall not exceed the cumulative sum
of the minimum requirements specified at the Base Station RF Bandwidth
edges on each side of the Inter-RF Bandwidth gap. The minimum
requirement for Base Station RF Bandwidth edge is specified in Table
6.6.2.2-1 to 6.6.2.2-8 below, where in this case:

\- ∆f is the separation between the Base Station RF Bandwidth edge
frequency and the nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to
the carrier frequency.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the Base Station RF Bandwidth
edge frequency and the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is equal to the Inter RF Bandwidth gap minus half of
the bandwidth of the measuring filter.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offsetmax minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

For a BS capable of multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped
on the same antenna connector and where there is no carrier transmitted
in an operating band, the operating band unwanted emission limit, as
defined in the tables of the present subclause for the largest frequency
offset (∆f~max~), of a band where there is no carrier transmitted shall
apply from Δf~OBUE~ below the lowest frequency, up to Δf~OBUE~ above the
highest frequency of the supported downlink operating band without any
carrier transmitted. And no cumulative limits are applied in the
inter-band gap between a supported downlink band with carrier(s)
transmitted and a supported downlink band without any carrier
transmitted.

Inside any sub-block gap for a BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum,
emissions shall not exceed the cumulative sum of the minimum requirement
specified for the adjacent sub blocks on each side of the sub block gap.
The minimum requirement for each sub block is specified in Tables
6.6.2.2-1 to 6.6.2.2-8 below, where in this case:

\- ∆f is the separation between the sub block edge frequency and the
nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to the sub block
edge.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the sub block edge frequency and
the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is equal to the sub block gap bandwidth minus half of
the bandwidth of the measuring filter.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

Applicability of Wide Area operating band unwanted emission requirements
in Tables 6.6.2.2-1, 6.6.2.2-2a and 6.6.2.2-2b is specified in Table
6.6.2.2-0.

Note: Option 1 and option 2 correspond to the Category B option 1/2
operating band unwanted emissions defined in the E-UTRA and NR
specifications TS 36.104 \[4\] and TS 38.104 \[17\]. Option 2 also
corresponds to the UTRA spectrum emission mask as defined in TS 25.104
\[2\] with GSM related modifications.

+----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+

The following notes are common to all subclauses in 6.6.2:

NOTE 6: This frequency range ensures that the range of values of
f\_offset is continuous.

NOTE 7: As a general rule for the requirements in the present subclause,
the resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment should be equal to
the measurement bandwidth. However, to improve measurement accuracy,
sensitivity and efficiency, the resolution bandwidth may be smaller than
the measurement bandwidth. When the resolution bandwidth is smaller than
the measurement bandwidth, the result should be integrated over the
measurement bandwidth in order to obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth
of the measurement bandwidth.

NOTE 8: The requirement is not applicable when ∆f~max~ \< Δf~OBUE~.

NOTE 9: All limits in Table 6.6.2.2‑1, Table 6.6.2.2‑3, Table 6.6.2.2‑4
and Table 6.6.2.2‑7 are identical to the corresponding limits for Band
Category 1 and 3.

#### 6.6.2.3 GSM/EDGE single-RAT requirements

The following requirements in TS 45.005 \[5\] shall apply to an MSR Base
Station for any operating band with GSM/EDGE single RAT operation in
Band Category 2:

\- Spectrum due to the modulation and wide band noise*,* applicable
parts of subclause 4.2.1.1, 4.2.1.2, 4.2.1.3-a2, 4.2.1.3-b2, 4.2.1.3-c2
and 4.2.1.4.2.

\- Spectrum due to switching transients, applicable parts of subclause
4.2.2.1-b.

\- Emission requirement for frequency offsets of between 2 and 10 MHz
outside relevant transmit band, applicable parts of subclause 4.3.1 and
4.3.2.1.

\- Intra BTS Intermodulation, applicable parts of subclause 4.7.2,
4.7.2.1-b, 4.7.2.3-b and 4.7.2.3-c.

#### 6.6.2.4 Additional requirements

##### 6.6.2.4.1 Limits in FCC Title 47

In addition to the requirements in subclauses 6.6.2.1 and 6.6.2.2, the
BS may have to comply with the applicable emission limits established by
FCC Title 47 \[8\], when deployed in regions where those limits are
applied, and under the conditions declared by the manufacturer.

##### 6.6.2.4.2 Unsynchronized operation for BC3 

In certain regions, the following requirements may apply to a TDD BS
operating in BC3 in the same geographic area and in the same operating
band as another TDD system without synchronisation. For this case the
emissions shall not exceed -52 dBm/MHz in each supported downlink
operating band except in:

\- The frequency range from 10 MHz below the lower Base Station RF
Bandwidth edge to the frequency 10 MHz above the upper Base Station RF
Bandwidth edge of each supported band.

NOTE 1: Local or regional regulations may specify another excluded
frequency range, which may include frequencies where synchronised TDD
systems operate.

NOTE 2: TDD base stations that are synchronized and operating in BC3 can
transmit without these additional co-existence requirements.

NOTE 3: Unsynchronized operation for BC3 BS with any NR configuration is
not covered by the present release of this specification.

##### 6.6.2.4.3 Protection of DTT 

In certain regions the following requirement may apply for protection of
DTT. For a BS operating in Band 20, the level of emissions in the band
470-790 MHz, measured in an 8 MHz filter bandwidth on centre frequencies
F~filter~ according to Table 6.6.2.4.3-1, shall not exceed the maximum
emission level P~EM,N~ declared by the manufacturer. This requirement
applies in the frequency range 470-790 MHz even though part of the range
falls in the spurious domain.

Table 6.6.2.4.3-1: Declared emissions levels for protection of DTT

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Filter centre frequency, F~filter~   Measurement bandwidth   Declared emission level \[dBm\]
  ------------------------------------ ----------------------- ---------------------------------

  21 ≤ N ≤ 60                                                  

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: The regional requirement is defined in terms of EIRP (effective
isotropic radiated power), which is dependent on both the BS emissions
at the antenna connector and the deployment (including antenna gain and
feeder loss). The requirement defined above provides the characteristics
of the base station needed to verify compliance with the regional
requirement. Compliance with the regional requirement can be determined
using the method outlined in Annex G of TS 36.104 \[4\].

##### 6.6.2.4.4 Void

Table 6.6.2.4.4-1:Void

##### 6.6.2.4.5 Co-existence with RNSS/GPS services in North America

In regions where FCC regulation applies, requirements for protection of
GPS according to FCC Order DA 20-48 applies for operation in Band 24.
The following normative requirement covers the base station, to be used
together with other information about the site installation to verify
compliance with the requirement in FCC Order DA 20-48. The requirement
applies to BS operating in Band 24 to ensure that appropriate
interference protection is provided to the 1541 -- 1650 MHz band. This
requirement applies to the frequency range 1541-1650 MHz.

The level of emissions in the 1541 -- 1650 MHz band, measured in
measurement bandwidth according to Table 6.6.2.4.5-1 shall not exceed
the maximum emission levels P~EM,B24,a,~ P~EM,B24,b~, P~EM,B24,c~,
P~EM,B24,d~, P~EM,B24,e~ and P~EM,B24,f~ declared by the manufacturer.

Note: The regional requirements in FCC Order DA 20-48 are defined in
terms of EIRP (effective isotropic radiated power), which is dependent
on both the BS emissions at the antenna connector and the deployment
(including antenna gain and feeder loss). The EIRP level is calculated
using: P~EIRP~ = P~E~ + G~ant~ where P~E~ denotes the BS unwanted
emission level at the antenna connector, G~ant~ equals the BS antenna
gain minus feeder loss. The requirement defined above provides the
characteristics of the base station needed to verify compliance with the
regional requirement.

##### 6.6.2.4.7 Additional band 32, 50, 51, 74, 75 and 76 unwanted emissions

In certain regions, the following requirements may apply to BS operating
in Band 32 within 1452-1492 MHz, in Band 75 within 1432-1517 MHz and in
Band 76 within 1427-1432 MHz. The level of operating band unwanted
emissions, measured on centre frequencies f\_offset with filter
bandwidth, according to Table 6.6.2.4.7-1, shall neither exceed the
maximum emission level P~EM,B32,B75,B76,a\ ,~ P~EM,B32,B75,B76,b~ nor
P~EM,B32,B75,B76,c~ declared by the manufacturer.

For Band 32, this requirement applies in the frequency range 1452-1492
MHz when non-Mobile/Fixed Communications Network (MFCN) services are
deployed in adjacent frequency ranges, while it applies also within
1427-1452 MHz and/or 1492-1517 MHz when MFCN services are deployed in
such frequency ranges, even though part of the ranges falls in the
spurious domain. For Band 75, this requirement applies in the frequency
range 1427-1517 MHz. For Band 76, this requirement applies in the
frequency range 1432-1517 MHz even though part of the range falls in the
spurious domain.

### 6.6.3 Occupied bandwidth

The occupied bandwidth is the width of a frequency band such that, below
the lower and above the upper frequency limits, the mean powers emitted
are each equal to a specified percentage β/2 of the total mean
transmitted power. See also ITU-R Recommendation SM.328 \[11\].

The value of β/2 shall be taken as 0.5%.

The requirement in the present clause applies during the transmitter ON
period for a single transmitted carrier. For E-UTRA intra-band
contiguous carrier aggregation, the requirement in clause 6.6.1 of TS
36.104 \[4\] applies for the E-UTRA component carriers that are
aggregated. For NR intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation, the
requirement in clause 6.6.2.2 of TS 38.104 \[17\] applies for the NR
component carriers that are aggregated. The minimum requirement below
may be applied regionally. There may also be regional requirements to
declare the occupied bandwidth according to the definition in the
present clause.

#### 6.6.3.1 Minimum requirement

The occupied bandwidth shall be less than values listed in
Table 6.6.3.1-1.

Table 6.6.3.1-1: Occupied bandwidth

  1.28 Mcps UTRA TDD   1.6 MHz
  NB-IoT               200 kHz

### 6.6.4 Adjacent Channel Leakage Power Ratio (ACLR)

Adjacent Channel Leakage Power Ratio (ACLR) is the ratio of the filtered
mean power centred on the assigned channel frequency to the filtered
mean power centred on an adjacent channel frequency.

#### 6.6.4.1 E-UTRA minimum requirement

For E-UTRA, the minimum requirement for ACLR is specified in Table
6.6.4.1-1 and 6.6.4.1-2 and applies outside the Base Station RF
Bandwidth or Radio Bandwidth.

For a BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum, the ACLR also applies for
the first adjacent channel inside any sub-block gap with a gap size
W~gap~ ≥ 15MHz. The ACLR requirement for the second adjacent channel
applies inside any sub-block gap with a gap size W~gap~ ≥ 20 MHz. The
CACLR requirement in subclause 6.6.4.4 applies in sub block gaps for the
frequency ranges defined in Table 6.6.4.4-1.

For a BS operating in multiple bands, where multiple bands are mapped
onto the same antenna connector, the ACLR also applies for the first
adjacent channel inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap with a gap size
W~gap~ ≥ 15MHz. The ACLR requirement for the second adjacent channel
applies inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap with a gap size W~gap~ ≥ 20
MHz.

The CACLR requirement in subclause 6.6.4.4 applies in Inter-RF Bandwidth
gaps for the frequency ranges defined in Table 6.6.4.4-1.

The requirements apply during the transmitter ON period.

The ACLR is defined with a square filter of bandwidth equal to the
transmission bandwidth configuration of the transmitted signal
(BW~Config~) centred on the assigned channel frequency and a filter
centred on the adjacent channel frequency according to the tables below.

For Category A Wide Area BS, either the ACLR limits in the tables below
or the absolute limit of -13dBm/MHz shall apply, whichever is less
stringent.

For Category B Wide Area BS, either the ACLR limits in the tables below
or the absolute limit of -15dBm/MHz shall apply, whichever is less
stringent. For Medium Range BS, either the ACLR limits in the tables
below or the absolute limit of -25 dBm/MHz shall apply, whichever is
less stringent.

For Local Area BS, either the ACLR limits in the tables below or the
absolute limit of -32dBm/MHz shall apply, whichever is less stringent.

For operation in paired spectrum, the ACLR shall be higher than the
value specified in Table 6.6.4.1‑1.

#### 6.6.4.2 UTRA FDD minimum requirement

For UTRA FDD, the minimum requirement for ACLR is specified in TS 25.104
\[2\], subclause 6.6.2.2, and applies outside the Base Station RF
Bandwidth or Radio Bandwidth.

For a BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum, ACLR requirement also
applies for the first adjacent channel, inside any sub-block gap with a
gap size W~gap~ ≥ 15 MHz. The ACLR requirement for the second adjacent
channel applies inside any sub-block gap with a gap size W~gap~ ≥ 20
MHz. The CACLR requirement in subclause 6.6.4.4 applies in sub block
gaps for the frequency ranges defined in Table 6.6.4.4-1.

For a BS operating in multiple bands, where multiple bands are mapped
onto the same antenna connector, ACLR requirement also applies for the
first adjacent channel, inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap with a gap
size W~gap~ ≥ 15 MHz. The ACLR requirement for the second adjacent
channel applies inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap with a gap size W~gap~
≥ 20 MHz. The CACLR requirement in subclause 6.6.4.4 applies in Inter RF
Bandwidth gaps for the frequency ranges defined in Table 6.6.4.4-1.

#### 6.6.4.3 UTRA TDD minimum requirement

For UTRA TDD, the minimum requirement for ACLR is specified in TS 25.105
\[3\], subclause 6.6.2.2.1.2, and applies outside the Base Station RF
Bandwidth or Radio Bandwidth.

#### 6.6.4.4 Cumulative ACLR requirement in non-contiguous spectrum

The following requirement applies for the sub-block or Inter RF
Bandwidth gap sizes listed in Table 6.6.4.4-1:

\- Inside a sub-block gap within an operating band for a BS operating in
non-contiguous spectrum.

\- Inside an Inter RF Bandwidth gap for a BS operating in multiple
bands, where multiple bands are mapped on the same antenna connector.

The Cumulative Adjacent Channel Leakage Power Ratio (CACLR) in a
sub-block gap or the Inter RF Bandwidth gap is the ratio of

a\) the sum of the filtered mean power centred on the assigned channel
frequencies for the two carriers adjacent to each side of the sub-block
gap or the Inter RF Bandwidth gap, and

b\) the filtered mean power centred on a frequency channel adjacent to
one of the respective sub-block edges or Base Station RF Bandwidth
edges.

The requirement applies to adjacent channels of NR, E-UTRA or UTRA
carriers allocated adjacent to each side of the sub-block gap or the
Inter RF Bandwidth gap. The assumed filter for the adjacent channel
frequency is defined in Table 6.6.4.4-1 and the filters on the assigned
channels are defined in Table 6.6.4.4-2.

NOTE: If the RAT on the assigned channel frequencies are different, the
filters used are also different.

For Wide Area Category A BS, either the CACLR limits in Table 6.6.4.4-1
or the absolute limit of -13dBm/MHz shall apply, whichever is less
stringent.

For Wide Area Category B BS, either the CACLR limits in Table 6.6.4.4-1
or the absolute limit of -15dBm/MHz shall apply, whichever is less
stringent.

For Medium Range BS, either the CACLR limits in Table 6.6.4.4-1 or the
absolute limit of -25 dBm/MHz shall apply, whichever is less stringent.

For Local Area BS, either the CACLR limits in Table 6.6.4.4-1 or the
absolute limit of -32 dBm/MHz shall apply, whichever is less stringent.

The CACLR for E-UTRA and UTRA carriers located on either side of the
sub-block gap or the Inter RF Bandwidth gap shall be higher than the
value specified in Table 6.6.4.4-1.

#### 6.6.4.6 NR minimum requirement

For NR, the minimum requirements shall apply outside the Base Station RF
Bandwidth or Radio Bandwidth whatever the type of transmitter considered
(single carrier or multi-carrier) and for all transmission modes
foreseen by the manufacturer\'s specification.

For a BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum, the ACLR requirement
shall apply in *sub-block gaps* for the frequency ranges defined in
table 6.6.4.6-2a, while the CACLR requirement shall apply in *sub-block
gaps* for the frequency ranges defined in table 6.6.4.4-1.

For BS operating in multiple bands, where multiple bands are mapped onto
the same *antenna connector*, the ACLR requirement shall apply in *Inter
RF Bandwidth gaps* for the frequency ranges defined in table 6.6.4.6-2a,
while the CACLR requirement in subclause 6.6.4.4 shall apply in *Inter
RF Bandwidth gaps* for the frequency ranges defined in table 6.6.4.4-1.

The requirement shall apply during the *transmitter ON period*. The ACLR
is defined with a square filter of bandwidth equal to the transmission
bandwidth configuration of the transmitted signal (BW~Config~) centred
on the assigned channel frequency and a filter centred on the adjacent
channel frequency according to the tables below.

The ACLR absolute *limit* in table 6.6.4.6-2 or the ACLR (CACLR) *limit*
in table 6.6.4.6-1, 6.6.4.6-2a or 6.6.4.4-1, whichever is less
stringent, shall apply for each *antenna connector*.

For operation in paired and unpaired spectrum, the ACLR shall be higher
than the value specified in table 6.6.4.6‑1.

For Band 41 NR operation in Japan, absolute ACLR limits shall be applied
to the sum of the absolute ACLR power over all *antenna connectors*.

6.7 Transmitter intermodulation
-------------------------------

The transmitter intermodulation requirement is a measure of the
capability of the transmitter to inhibit the generation of signals in
its non-linear elements caused by presence of the wanted signal and an
interfering signal reaching the transmitter via the antenna. The
requirement applies during the transmitter ON period and the transmitter
transient period.

For BS capable of multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped
on separate antenna connectors, the single-band requirements apply
regardless of the interfering signals position relative to the Inter-RF
Bandwidth gap.

### 6.7.1 General minimum requirement

The transmitter intermodulation level is the power of the
intermodulation products when an interfering signal is injected into the
antenna connector.

The transmitter intermodulation level shall not exceed the unwanted
emission limits in subclause 6.6.1, 6.6.2, 6.6.4 in the presence of a
wanted signal and an interfering signal according to Table 6.7.1‑1 for
BS operation in BC1, BC2 and BC3.

The requirement is applicable outside the Base Station RF Bandwidth or
Radio Bandwidth. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to
the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges or Radio Bandwidth edges.

For BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum, the requirement is also
applicable inside a sub-block gap for interfering signal offsets where
the interfering signal falls completely within the sub-block gap. The
interfering signal offset is defined relative to the sub-block edges.

For BS capable of multi-band operation, the requirement applies relative
to the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges of each operating band. In case
the Inter RF Bandwidth gap is less than 15 MHz, the requirement in the
gap applies only for interfering signal offsets where the interfering
signal falls completely within the Inter RF Bandwidth gap.

### 6.7.2 Additional minimum requirement (BC1 and BC2)

The transmitter intermodulation level shall not exceed the unwanted
emission limits in subclause 6.6.1, 6.6.2, 6.6.4 in the presence of a
wanted signal and an interfering signal according to Table 6.7.2-1 for
BS operation in BC2.

The requirement is applicable outside the Base Station RF Bandwidth and
Radio Bandwidth for BC2. The interfering signal offset is defined
relative to the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges or Radio Bandwidth
edges.

For BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum in BC1 or BC2, the
requirement is also applicable inside a sub-block gap with a gap size
larger than or equal to two times the interfering signal centre
frequency offset. For BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum in BC1,
the requirement is not applicable inside a sub-block gap with a gap size
equal to or larger than 5 MHz. The interfering signal offset is defined
relative to the sub-block edges.

For BS capable of multi-band operation, the requirement applies relative
to the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges of a BC2 operating band. The
requirement is also applicable for BC1 and BC2 inside an Inter RF
Bandwidth gap equal to or larger than two times the interfering signal
centre frequency offset. For BS capable of multi-band operation, the
requirement is not applicable for BC1 band inside an Inter RF Bandwidth
gap with a gap size equal to or larger than 5 MHz.

  NOTE: Interfering signal positions that are partially or completely outside of any downlink operating band of the base station are excluded from the requirement.   

### 6.7.3 Additional minimum requirement (BC3)

This additional requirement shall only apply for BS co-located with an
UTRA TDD BS.

The transmitter intermodulation level shall not exceed the unwanted
emission limits in subclause 6.6.1, 6.6.2, 6.6.4 in the presence of a
wanted signal and an interfering signal according to Table 6.7.3-1 for
BS operation in BC3.

For BS capable of multi-band operation, the requirement applies relative
to the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges of each operating band. In case
the Inter RF Bandwidth gap is less than 3.2 MHz, the requirement in the
gap applies only for interfering signal offsets where the interfering
signal falls completely within the Inter RF Bandwidth gap.

7 Receiver characteristics
==========================

7.1 General
-----------

The requirements in clause 7 are expressed for a single receiver antenna
connector. For receivers with antenna diversity or in case of
multi-carrier reception with multiple receiver antenna connectors, the
requirements apply for each receiver antenna connector.

For blocking and intermodulation characteristics, the negative offsets
of the interfering signal apply relative to the assigned channel
frequency of the lowest carrier frequency received and positive offsets
of the interfering signal apply relative to the assigned channel
frequency of the highest carrier frequency received.

A BS supporting DC-HSUPA receives two UTRA FDD cells simultaneously on
adjacent carrier frequencies.

Unless otherwise stated, the receiver characteristics are specified at
the BS antenna connector (test port A) with a full complement of
transceivers for the configuration in normal operating conditions. For
FDD operation the requirements in clause 7 shall be met with the
transmitter(s) on. If any external apparatus such as a RX amplifier, a
filter or the combination of such devices is used, requirements apply at
the far end antenna connector (test port B).

NOTE: In normal operating conditions the BS in FDD operation is
configured to transmit and receive at the same time. The transmitter may
be off for some of the tests as specified in 37.141 \[10\].

Unless otherwise stated the requirements in clause 7 apply during the
base station receive period.

Unless otherwise stated the requirements for NB-IoT in subclause 7
applies for all operation modes (In-band operation, Guard-band operation
and Stand-alone operation).

7.4 In-band selectivity and blocking
------------------------------------

The in-band selectivity and blocking characteristics are measures of the
receiver ability to receive a wanted signal at its assigned channel in
the presence of an unwanted interferer inside the operating band and are
defined by a (wideband) and a narrowband blocking requirement.

The in-band blocking requirement applies from F~UL\_low~ - Δf~OOB~ to
F~UL\_high~ + Δf~OOB~, excluding the downlink frequency range of the FDD
*operating band*. The values of Δf~OOB~ are defined in table 7.4-1.

  *Operating band* characteristics                 Δf~OOB~ \[MHz\]
  ------------------------------------------------ -----------------
  200 MHz ≥ F~UL\_high~ -- F~UL\_low~              20
  200 MHz \< F~UL\_high~ -- F~UL\_low~ ≤ 900 MHz   60

### 7.4.1 General blocking minimum requirement

For the general blocking requirement, the interfering signal shall be a
UTRA FDD signal as specified in annex A for a UTRA, E-UTRA, NB-IOT,
GSM/EDGE or NR (≤ 20 MHz) wanted signal. The interfering signal shall be

than 20MHz.

The requirement is applicable outside the Base Station RF Bandwidth or
Radio Bandwidth. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to
the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges or Radio Bandwidth edges.

For BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum, the requirement applies in
addition inside any sub-block gap, in case the sub-block gap size is at
least 15 MHz. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the
sub-block edges inside the sub-block gap.

For BS capable of multi-band operation, the requirement applies in
addition inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap, in case the gap size is at
least 15 MHz. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the
Base Station RF Bandwidth edges inside the Inter RF Bandwidth gap.

For the wanted and interfering signal coupled to the base station
antenna input, using the parameters in Table 7.4.1‑1, the following
requirements shall be met:

\- For any E-UTRA carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channel defined in TS 36.104
\[4\], subclause 7.2.

\- For any UTRA FDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0.001 for the
reference measurement channel defined in TS 25.104 \[2\], subclause 7.2.

\- For any UTRA TDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0.001 for the

Table 7.4.1-2: Void

NOTE: The requirement in Table 7.4.1-1 assumes that two operating bands,
where the downlink operating band (see Table 4.5-1 and Table 4.5-2) of
one band would be within the in-band blocking region of the other band,
are not deployed in the same geographical area.

### 7.4.2 General narrowband blocking minimum requirement

For the general narrowband blocking requirement, the interfering signal
shall be an E-UTRA 1RB signal as specified in Annex A.

The requirement is applicable outside the Base Station RF Bandwidth or
Radio Bandwidth. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to
the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges or Radio Bandwidth edges.

For BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum, the requirement applies in
addition inside any sub-block gap, in case the sub-block gap size is at
least 3 MHz. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the
sub-block edges inside the sub-block gap.

For BS capable of multi-band operation, the requirement applies in
addition inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap in case the gap size is at
least 3 MHz. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the
Base Station RF Bandwidth edges inside the Inter RF Bandwidth gap.

For the wanted and interfering signal coupled to the base station
antenna input, using the parameters in Table 7.4.2‑1, the following
requirements shall be met:

\- For any E-UTRA carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channel defined in TS 36.104
\[4\], subclause 7.2.

\- For any UTRA FDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0.001 for the
reference measurement channel defined in TS 25.104 \[2\], subclause 7.2.

\- For any UTRA TDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0.001 for the
reference measurement channel defined in TS 25.105 \[3\], subclause 7.2.

\- For any GSM/EDGE carrier, the conditions are specified in TS 45.005
\[5\], Annex P.2.1.

\- For any NB-IoT carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channel defined in TS 36.104
\[4\], subclause 7.2.

\- For any NR carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channel defined in TS 38.104
\[17\], subclause 7.2.

### 7.4.3 Additional Narrowband blocking minimum requirement for GSM/EDGE

The GSM/EDGE in-band blocking requirement as stated in TS 45.005 \[5\],
applicable parts of subclauses 5.1.3 and 5.1.4, shall apply for any
GSM/EDGE carrier.

The conditions specified in TS 45.005 \[5\], Annex P.2.1 apply for
GSM/EDGE in-band narrowband blocking.

### 7.4.4 GSM/EDGE requirements for AM suppression

The GSM/EDGE AM suppression requirement as stated in TS 45.005 \[5\],
applicable parts of subclauses 5.2.2, shall apply for any GSM/EDGE
carrier.

The conditions specified in TS 45.005 \[5\], Annex P.2.3 apply for
GSM/EDGE AM suppression.

### 7.4.5 Additional BC3 blocking minimum requirement

This additional requirement only applies for BS operating in the same
geographical area as UTRA TDD.

The interfering signal is a 1.28 Mcps UTRA TDD modulated signal as
specified in Annex A.

The requirement is always applicable outside the Base Station RF
Bandwidth or Radio Bandwidth. The interfering signal offset is defined
relative to the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges or Radio Bandwidth
edges.

For BS capable of multi-band operation, the requirement applies in
addition inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap, in case the gap size is at
least 4.8 MHz. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the
Base Station RF Bandwidth edges inside the Inter RF Bandwidth gap.

For the wanted and interfering signal coupled to the base station
antenna input, using the parameters in Table 7.4.5‑1, the following
requirements shall be met:

\- For any E-UTRA, E-UTRA with NB-IoT and/or NB-IoT TDD carrier, the
throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel defined in TS 36.104 \[4\], subclause 7.2.

\- For any UTRA TDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0.001 for the
reference measurement channel defined in TS 25.105 \[3\], subclause 7.2.

7.5 Out-of-band blocking
------------------------

The Out-of-band blocking characteristic is a measure of the receiver
ability to receive a wanted signal at its assigned channel in the
presence of an unwanted interferer outside the uplink operating band.

### 7.5.1 General minimum requirement

For a wanted and an interfering signal coupled to BS antenna input using
the parameters in Table 7.5.1-1, the following requirements shall be
met:

\- For any E-UTRA carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channel defined in TS 36.104
\[4\], subclause 7.2.

\- For any UTRA FDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0.001 for the
reference measurement channel defined in TS 25.104 \[2\], subclause 7.2.

\- For any UTRA TDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0.001 for the
reference measurement channel defined in TS 25.105 \[3\], subclause 7.2.

\- For any GSM/EDGE carrier, the conditions are specified in TS 45.005
\[5\], Annex P.2.1.

\- For any NB-IoT carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channel defined in TS 36.104
\[4\], subclause 7.2.

\- For any NR carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channel defined in TS 38.104
\[17\], subclause 7.2.

For BS capable of multi-band operation, the requirement applies for each
supported operating band. The in-band blocking frequency ranges of all
supported operating bands according to Table 7.4.1-1 shall be excluded
from the requirement.

The out-of-band blocking requirement applies from 1 MHz to F~UL\_low~ -
Δf~OOB~ and from F~UL\_high~ + Δf~OOB~ up to 12750MHz, including the
downlink frequency range of the FDD *operating band for BS supporting
FDD*. Δf~OOB~ is defined in table 7.4-1

### 7.5.2 Co-location minimum requirement

This additional blocking requirement may be applied for the protection
of BS receivers when NR, E-UTRA, NB-IoT, UTRA, CDMA or GSM/EDGE BS
operating in a different frequency band are co-located with a BS.

The requirements in this subclause assume a 30 dB coupling loss between
the interfering transmitter and the BS receiver and are based on
co-location with base stations of the same class.

For a wanted and an interfering signal coupled to BS antenna input using
the parameters in Table 7.5.2-1, the following requirements shall be
met:

\- For any E-UTRA carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channel defined in TS 36.104
\[4\], subclause 7.2.

\- For any UTRA FDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0.001 for the
reference measurement channel defined in TS 25.104 \[2\], subclause 7.2.

\- For any UTRA TDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0.001 for the
reference measurement channel defined in TS 25.105 \[3\], subclause 7.2.

\- For any GSM/EDGE carrier, the conditions are specified in TS 45.005
\[5\], Annex P.2.1.

\- For any NB-IoT carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channel defined in TS 36.104
\[4\], subclause 7.2.

\- For any NR carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channel defined in TS 38.104
\[17\], subclause 7.2.

7.6 Receiver spurious emissions
-------------------------------

The receiver spurious emissions power is the power of emissions
generated or amplified in a receiver that appear at the BS receiver
antenna connector. The requirements apply to all BS with separate RX and
TX antenna ports. In this case for FDD BS the test shall be performed
when both TX and RX are on, with the TX port terminated.

For TDD BS with common RX and TX antenna port the requirement applies
during the Transmitter OFF period. For FDD BS with common RX and TX
antenna port the transmitter spurious emission limits as specified in
subclause 6.6.1 are valid.

For BS capable of multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped
on separate antenna connectors, the single-band requirements apply and
the excluded frequency range is only applicable for the operating band
supported on each antenna connector.

### 7.6.1 General minimum requirement

The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the levels in Table
7.6.1-1:

  NOTE: The frequency range from F~BW\ RF,DL,low~ - Δf~OBUE~ to F~BW\ RF,,DLhigh~ + Δf~OBUE~ may be excluded from the requirement. For BS capable of multi-band operation, the exclusion applies for all supported operating bands. For BS capable of multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped on separate antenna connectors, the single-band requirements apply and the excluded frequency range is only applicable for the operating band supported on each antenna connector.                                           

In addition to the requirements in Table 7.6.1-1, the power of any
spurious emission shall not exceed the Additional spurious emissions
requirements in subclause 6.6.1.3 and in case of FDD BS (for BC1 and
BC2) emission shall not exceed the levels specified for Protection of
the BS receivers of own or different BS in subclause 6.6.1.2. In
addition, the requirements for co-location with other base stations
specified in subclause 6.6.1.4 may also be applied.

### 7.6.2 Additional minimum requirement for BC2 (Category B)

For a BS operating in Band Category 2 when GSM/EDGE is configured and
where Category B spurious emissions apply, the power of any spurious
emissions shall not exceed the limits in Table 7.6.2-1.

For BS capable of multi-band operation, the limits in Table 7.6.2-1 are
only applicable when all supported operating bands belong to BC2 and
GSM/EDGE is configured in all bands.

7.7 Receiver intermodulation
----------------------------

Third and higher order mixing of the two interfering RF signals can
produce an interfering signal in the band of the desired channel.
Intermodulation response rejection is a measure of the capability of the
receiver to receive a wanted signal on its assigned channel frequency in
the presence of two interfering signals which have a specific frequency
relationship to the wanted signal.

### 7.7.1 General intermodulation minimum requirement

Interfering signals shall be a CW signal and an E-UTRA or UTRA signal as
specified in Annex A.

The requirement is applicable outside the Base Station RF Bandwidth or
Radio Bandwidth. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to
the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges or Radio Bandwidth edges.

For BS capable of multi-band operation, the requirement applies in
addition inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap, in case the gap size is at
least twice as wide as the UTRA/E-UTRA interfering signal centre
frequency offset from the Base Station RF Bandwidth edge. The
interfering signal offset is defined relative to the Base Station RF
Bandwidth edges inside the inter Base Station RF Bandwidth gap.

For the wanted signal at the assigned channel frequency and two
interfering signals coupled to the base station antenna input, using the
parameters in Table 7.7.1-1 and 7.7.1-2, the following requirements
shall be met:

\- For any E-UTRA carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channel defined in TS 36.104
\[4\], subclause 7.2.

\- For any UTRA FDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0.001 for the
reference measurement channel defined in TS 25.104 \[2\], subclause 7.2.

\- For any UTRA TDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0.001 for the
reference measurement channel defined in TS 25.105 \[3\], subclause 7.2.

\- For any GSM/EDGE carrier, the conditions are specified in TS 45.005
\[5\], Annex P.2.2.

\- For any NB-IoT carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channel defined in TS 36.104
\[4\], subclause 7.2.

\- For any NR carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channel defined in TS 38.104
\[17\], subclause 7.2.

### 7.7.2 General narrowband intermodulation minimum requirement

Interfering signals shall be a CW signal and an E-UTRA 1RB signal as
specified in Annex A.

The requirement is applicable outside the Base Station RF Bandwidth or
Radio Bandwidth. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to
the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges or Radio Bandwidth edges.

For BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum within each supported
operating band, the requirement applies in addition inside any sub-block
gap in case the sub-block gap is at least as wide as the channel
bandwidth of the E-UTRA interfering signal in Table 7.7.2-2. The
interfering signal offset is defined relative to the sub-block edges
inside the gap.

For BS capable of multi-band operation, the requirement applies in
addition inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap in case the gap size is at
least as wide as the E-UTRA interfering signal in Table 7.7.2-2. The
interfering signal offset is defined relative to the Base Station RF
Bandwidth edges inside the Inter RF Bandwidth gap.

For the wanted signal at the assigned channel frequency and two
interfering signals coupled to the base station antenna input, using the
parameters in Table 7.7.2-1 and 7.7.2-2, the following requirements
shall be met:

\- For any E-UTRA carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channel defined in TS 36.104
\[4\], subclause 7.2.

\- For any UTRA FDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0.001 for the
reference measurement channel defined in TS 25.104 \[2\], subclause 7.2.

\- For any UTRA TDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0.001 for the
reference measurement channel defined in TS 25.105 \[3\], subclause 7.2.

\- For any GSM/EDGE carrier, the conditions are specified in TS 45.005
\[5\], Annex P.2.2.

\- For any NB-IoT carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channel defined in TS 36.104
\[4\], subclause 7.2.

\- For any NR carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channel defined in TS 38.104
\[17\], subclause 7.2.
