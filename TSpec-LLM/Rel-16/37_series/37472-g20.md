Foreword
========

This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:

**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something

**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something

The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the
context of normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.

The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes
for \"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as
possible, and they are not used in a normative context except in a
direct citation from an external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so
as to maintain continuity of style when extending or modifying the
provisions of such a referenced document.

**should** indicates a recommendation to do something

**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something

**may** indicates permission to do something

**need not** indicates permission not to do something

The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\"
are used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.

**can** indicates that something is possible

**cannot** indicates that something is impossible

The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\"
and \"need not\".

**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a
result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to
happen as a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which
is outside the scope of the present document

**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result
of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document

**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

In addition:

**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement
of fact

**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates
a statement of fact

The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

1 Scope
=======

The present document specifies the standards for Signalling Transport to
be used across the W1 interface. The W1 interface provides means for
interconnecting a ng-eNB-CU and a ng-eNB-DU of a ng-eNB within a NG-RAN.
The present document describes how the W1AP signalling messages are
transported over W1.

2 References
============

The following documents contain provisions which, through reference in
this text, constitute provisions of the present document.

\- References are either specific (identified by date of publication,
edition number, version number, etc.) or non‑specific.

\- For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.

\- For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the case
of a reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), a
non-specific reference implicitly refers to the latest version of that
document *in the same Release as the present document*.

interconnection point between the ng-eNB-CU and the ng-eNB-DU.

**W1-C**: Reference point for the control plane protocol between
ng-eNB-CU and ng-eNB-DU.

3.3 Abbreviations
-----------------

For the purposes of the present document, the abbreviations given in
3GPP TR 21.905 \[1\] and the following apply. An abbreviation defined in
the present document takes precedence over the definition of the same
abbreviation, if any, in 3GPP TR 21.905 \[1\].

DiffServ Differentiated Service

IANA Internet Assigned Number Authority

IP Internet Protocol

PPP Point to Point Protocol

SCTP Stream Control Transmission Protocol

4. W1-C signalling bearer
-------------------------

4.1 Function and protocol stack
-------------------------------

The W1-C signalling bearer provides the following functions:

\- Provision of reliable transfer of W1AP messages over the W1-C
interface.

\- Provision of networking and routeing function.

\- Provision of redundancy in the signalling network.

\- Support for flow control and congestion control.

The protocol stack for W1-C Signalling Bearer is shown in figure 4.1-1
and details on each protocol are described in the following clauses.

Figure 4.1-1: W1-C signalling bearer protocol stack

The Transport Network Layer is based on IP transport, comprising SCTP on
top of IP.

5 Data link layer
=================

The support of any suitable Data Link Layer protocol, e.g. PPP,
Ethernet, etc., shall not be prevented.

6 IP layer
==========

The ng-eNB-CU and ng-eNB-DU shall support IPv6 (IETF RFC 8200 \[2\])
and/or IPv4 (IETF RFC 791 \[3\]).

The IP layer of W1-C only supports point-to-point transmission for
delivering W1AP message.

The ng-eNB-CU and ng-eNB-DU shall support the Diffserv Code Point
marking as described in IETF RFC 2474 \[4\].

7 Transport layer
=================

SCTP (IETF RFC 4960 \[5\]) shall be supported as the transport layer of
W1-C signalling bearer. The Payload Protocol Identifier assigned by IANA
to be used by SCTP for the application layer protocol W1AP is 73.

SCTP refers to the Stream Control Transmission Protocol developed by the
Sigtran working group of the IETF for the purpose of transporting
various signalling protocols over IP network.

The ng-eNB-DU and ng-eNB-CU shall support a configuration with a single
SCTP association per ng-eNB-DU/ng-eNB-CU pair.

The ng-eNB-DU shall establish the SCTP association. The SCTP Destination
Port number value assigned by IANA to be used for W1AP is 37472.

Within the set of SCTP associations established between one ng-eNB-CU
and ng-eNB-DU pair, a single SCTP association shall be employed for W1AP
elementary procedures that utilize non-UE-associated signalling with the
possibility of fail-over to a new association to enable robustness.

Between one ng-eNB-CU and ng-eNB-DU pair:

\- A single pair of stream identifiers shall be reserved over an SCTP
association for the sole use of W1AP elementary procedures that utilize
non UE-associated signalling.

\- At least one pair of stream identifiers over one or several SCTP
associations shall be reserved for the sole use of W1AP elementary
procedures that utilize UE-associated signalling. However, a few pairs
(i.e. more than one) should be reserved.

\- For a single UE-associated signalling, the ng-eNB-DU shall use one
SCTP association and one SCTP stream, and the association/stream should
not be changed during the communication of the UE-associated signalling
unless TNL binding update is performed.

Transport network redundancy may be achieved by SCTP multi-homing
between two end-points, of which one or both is assigned with multiple
IP addresses. SCTP end-points shall support a multi-homed remote SCTP
end-point. **For SCTP endpoint redundancy an INIT may be sent from a
ng-eNB-CU or ng-eNB-DU, at any time for an already established SCTP
association, which shall be handled as defined in IETF RFC 4960\[5\] in
sub clause 5.2.**

The SCTP congestion control may, using an implementation specific
mechanism, initiate higher layer protocols to reduce the signalling
traffic at the source and prioritise certain messages.
