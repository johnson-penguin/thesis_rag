The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\"
and \"need not\".

**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a
result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to
happen as a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which
is outside the scope of the present document

**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result
of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document

result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

In addition:

**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement
of fact

**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates
a statement of fact

The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

4 Background
============

4.1 Justification
-----------------

In 3GPP, many operators and vendors have realized the significant
benefit for increasing the UE transmits power. Now the HPUE for many
bands in LTE, e.g., Band 38, Band 40, Band 41 and Band 42 have been
completed. This results in significant improvement in UL coverage for
these high bands.

Meanwhile, the study of high power UE (HPUE) operation, i.e. power class
2, for NR Band n41, n77, n78 and n79 have been almost completed,
motivated by significant benefits in cell coverage and cell edge user
throughput that are needed for and can be achieved for NR related
networks. Considering E-UTRA and NR need sharing the transmit power in
the EN-DC mode, that means the EN-DC UL coverage will be less than NR
Standalone and LTE only. This WID will focus on introduce high power UE
for EN-DC (1 LTE FDD band + 1 NR TDD band) to the UL coverage of EN-DC
networks.

Many issues related to HPUE are common across different combinations.
Following the similar approach adopted for LTE TDD HPUE in RAN4, this
study item is to study how to introduce power class 2 for EN-DC for 1
LTE FDD band + 1 NR TDD band in Rel-16.

4.2 Objective
-------------

The objectives of the SI are as follows:

-   Study how to introduce the new power class 2 (1 LTE FDD band + 1 NR
    TDD band) for EN-DC bands in Rel-16

    -   Study and define the power class for EN-DC under different power
        > combination such as 23dBm LTE FDD+23dBm NR, 23dBm LTE
        > FDD+26dBm NR in table 4.2-1.

5 Power class definition for EN-DC
==================================

5.1 Power class
---------------

For EN-DC with 1 LTE FDD band and 1 NR TDD band, UE maximum output power
shall be measured over all component carriers from different bands. If
each band has separate antenna connectors, maximum output power is
measured as the sum of maximum output power at each UE antenna
connector. The period of measurement shall be at least one sub frame
(1ms). For the example band combination DC\_3A\_n78A, the maximum output
power can be specified as in Table 5.1-1.

5.2 Power combination of the power class
----------------------------------------

As stated in clause 4.2, two power combinations are studied i.e.

Case1: LTE FDD power class 3 (23dBm), NR TDD power class 3 (23dBm) and
EN-DC power class 2 (26dBm)

Case2: LTE FDD power class 3 (23dBm), NR TDD power class 2 (26dBm) and
EN-DC power class 2 (26dBm)

Unless otherwise stated, requirements written in TS 36.101-1 \[5\] and
TS 38.101-1 \[3\] apply for LTE and NR transmitters respectively.

6 Solutions for SAR Compliance
==============================

6.1 General
-----------

To accommodate the SAR limits of the PC2 FDD-TDD High Power UE, a
combined UE-based and network-based solution is considered in the study
phase. In the network-based solution, there will be a threshold based on
the duty cycle and power settings of LTE and NR, the PC2 UE is assumed
to be capable of maintaining the PC2 power if the network setting or
scheduling does not exceed the threshold. In addition to the network
based solution, a UE based solution based on the autonomous UE maximum
power back off mechanism, i.e., P-MPR, can further allow the UE to
ensure SAR compliance. For the network-based solution following
different schemes were discussed in the SI.

6.2 Case1 of power class 2
--------------------------

### 6.2.1 Scheme 1

The following equation is applied between the LTE UL duty cycle, NR UL
duty cycle and the overall duty threshold.

-   **Duty~LTE~ \*( P~LTE~/ P~26~) + Duty~NR~ \*(P~NR~/ P~26~) ≤ *Duty
    threshold ...*(1)**

P~LTE~, P~NR~, P~26~ represent the maximum linear power (mW) of LTE, NR,
and EN-DC power class 2 respectively; Duty~LTE~, Duty~NR~ represent the
maximum uplink percentage of LTE, NR respectively. Duty threshold
represents the maximum UL duty cycle that can maintain the PC2 power
class for FDD+TDD EN-DC HPUE.

In the case 1 of power class 2 FDD-TDD EN-DC UE, the maximum uplink
power of LTE and NR are both 23dBm.By setting the P~LTE~, P~NR~ to be
23dBm, equation (1) can be simplified to the following equation.

-   **0.5\*Duty~LTE~ + 0.5\*Duty~NR~ ≤ *Duty threshold ...*(2)**

Duty~NR~, the uplink percentage of the NR TDD part is determined by
scheduling. Duty~LTE~, the maximum uplink percentage of the LTE FDD, can
be set up by TDM pattern or determined by scheduling. The maximum uplink
percentage of LTE FDD might be adjusted in order to keep the PC2 power.

The PC2 case 1 UE is allowed to fallback to PC3 if the LTE uplink
scheduling or the TDM pattern setting of the LTE UL, together with the
scheduled NR uplink duty cycle exceeds the duty threshold based on the
equation (2).

### 6.2.2 Scheme 2

Specific LTE reference configurations are defined for FDD-TDD EN-DC HPUE
duty cycle capability reporting. The reported capability is maximal NR
UL duty which can fulfil SAR limits when assuming LTE FDD side being
configured as the defined reference configurations with the maximum UL
power.

For case 1, the LTE reference configuration can be Duty~LTE~=70%. The
default value of NR UL duty capability can be 30% i.e. \"Duty~LTE~=70%
and P~LTE~=23dBm\", corresponding to default Duty~NR~=30%, P~NR~=23dBm.

Higher Duty~NR~ value can be reported as the UE capability e.g.
maxNRDuty. If the scheduled traffic fulfils DutyLTE\<70% and DutyNR\<
maxNRDuty, UE can maintain PC2 power.

For better flexibility, two LTE configurations are supported. Based on
the two LTE configurations {Duty~LTE~1, Duty~LTE~2}, UE optimizes its
SAR compliance capability and reports two DutyNR separately, e.g.
{maxNRDuty1, maxNRDuty2}.

### 6.2.3 Scheme 3

To address an issue that the impact of each of the uplink bands on SAR
is different, scheme 3 is proposed to consider that aspect in an
equation to derive SAR ration effect for each of the RATs as follows:

UplinkDutyCycle~LTE~\*( p~LTE~/p~PowerClass,\ EN-DC~) \*Ratio~effect~ +
UplinkDutyCycle~NR~\*(p~NR~/p~PowerClass,\ EN-DC~) ≤
*maxUplinkDutyCycle-EN-DC*;

Where;

-   maxUplinkDutyCycle-EN-DC for FDD LTE + TDD NR is to be defined in TS
    > 38.306 and that is the total maxUplinkDutyCycle of LTE FDD and NR
    > TDD uplink. Note in LTE TDD + NR TDD, the value is only for NR TDD
    > uplink.

-   UplinkDutyCycle~LTE~ is the percentage of LTE FDD uplink symbols
    > transmitted in a cetain evaluation period;

-   UplinkDutyCycle~NR~ is the percentage of NR TDD uplink symbols
    > transmitted in a cetain evaluation period;

-   P~PowerClass,\ EN-DC~ is defined in clause 6.2B.1.3 for inter-band
    > EN-DC. p~PowerClass,\ EN-DC~ is the linear value of
    > P~PowerClass,\ EN-DC~;

\- P~LTE~ is the value given by the field *p-maxEUTRA-r15* of the
*RRCConnectionReconfiguration-v1510* IE as defined in TS 38.331. p~LTE~
is the linear value of P~LTE~;

\- P~NR~ is the value given by the field *p-NR-FR1* of the
*PhysicalCellGroupConfig* IE as defined in TS 38.331. p~NR~ is the
linear value of P~NR~;

\- Ratio~effect~ is to be defined in TS 38.306 as coefficient taking
into account electromagnetic energy absorption effect ratio of the LTE
FDD band and the NR TDD band;

The above equations of would be able to consider the important aspects
which should be considered while both are mutually exclusive
relationships.

The above equations of would be able to consider the important aspects
which should be considered while both are mutually exclusive
relationships.

From the performance aspect, it is better to introduce Ratio~effect~ in
the equation to utilize the UE\'s ability. For example, it is assumed
that a UE has imbalance of SAR effect such as Ratio~effect~ =2, that is
SAR effect of NR band is 2 times as large as that of LTE band. In this
case, if we do not capture Ratio~effect~ factor in the equation, UE is
forced to report lower EN-DC total duty cycle than what it really has.
That is, assuming one of boundary condition is such that DutyLTE=100%
for LTE alone transmission and DutyNR=50% for NR alone transmission, and
if we does not introduce Ratio~effect~, UE are forced to report EN-DC
total duty cycle as 50% to consider the worst case scenario although the
UE has ability to transmit higher than 50% UL EN-DC duty cycle.

On the other hands, the scheme 3 becomes meaningful only when
Ratio~effect~ is within reasonable range. If the value in the equation
is set to 20, which was mentioned by a certain company, LTE FDD uplink
is almost not allowed. Given that maxUplinkDutyCycle-EN-DC = 100% while
LTE FDD (23dBm) + NR TDD (23dBm) are assumed. If NR TDD uplink duty
cycle is 50% for instance, the LTE FDD uplink duty cycle is 2.5%. Even
if NR TDD uplink duty cycle is 30%, still LTE FDD duty cycle is 3.5%.
The impact on LTE TDD uplink duty cycle depends on the total maxuplink
duty cycle. Hence, the range of Ratio~effect~ together with the total
maxuplinkdutycycle for EN-DC if that is introduced should be discussed.

6.3 Case2 of power class 2
--------------------------

### 6.3.1 Scheme 1

The following equation is applied between the LTE UL duty cycle, NR UL
duty cycle and the overall duty threshold.

-   **Duty~LTE~ \*( P~LTE~/ P~26~) + Duty~NR~ \*(P~NR~/ P~26~) ≤ *Duty
    threshold ...*(1)**

P~LTE~, P~NR~, P~26~ represent the maximum linear power (mW) of LTE, NR,
and EN-DC power class 2 respectively; Duty~LTE~, Duty~NR~ represent the
maximum uplink percentage of LTE, NR respectively. Duty threshold
represents the maximum UL duty cycle that can maintain the PC2 power
class for FDD+TDD EN-DC HPUE.

In the case 2 of power class 2 FDD-TDD EN-DC UE, the maximum uplink
power of LTE and NR are 23dBm and 26dBm respectively. By setting the
P~LTE~, P~NR~ to be 23dBm and 26dBm, equation (1) can be simplified to
the following equation. But note that in case 2 PC2 UE, the total
maximum power of LTE and NR cannot exceed 26dBm when transmitting both
LTE UL and NR UL at the same time.

-   **0.5\*Duty~LTE~ + Duty~NR~ ≤ *Duty threshold...*(2)**

As same as the scheme in clause 6.2.1, Duty~NR~ is determined by
scheduling. Duty~LTE~ can be set up by TDM pattern or determined by
scheduling.

The PC2 case 2 UE is allowed to fallback to PC3 if the LTE uplink
scheduling or the TDM pattern setting of the LTE UL, together with the
scheduled NR uplink duty cycle exceeds the duty threshold based on the
equation (2).

### 6.3.2 Scheme 2

Specific LTE reference configurations are defined for FDD-TDD EN-DC HPUE
duty cycle capability reporting. The reported capability is maximal NR
UL duty which can fulfil SAR limits when assuming LTE FDD side being
configured as the defined reference configuration with the maximum UL
power.

For case 2, the LTE reference configuration can be Duty~LTE~=40%. The
default value of NR UL duty capability can be 30% i.e. \"Duty~LTE~=40%
and P~LTE~=23dBm\", corresponding to default Duty~NR~=30%, P~NR~=26dBm.

Higher Duty~NR~ value can be reported as the UE capability e.g.
maxNRDuty. If the scheduled traffic fulfils Duty~LTE~\<40% and
Duty~NR~\< maxNRDuty, UE can maintain PC2 power.

For better flexibility, two LTE configurations are supported. Based on
the two LTE configurations {Duty~LTE~1, Duty~LTE~2}, UE optimizes its
SAR compliance capability and reports two *Duty~NR~* separately, e.g.
{*maxNRDuty1, maxNRDuty2*}.

### 6.3.3 Scheme 3

The equation is same as that described in clause 6.2.3 while P~LTE~ and
P~NR~ is set according to Case2 in Table 4.2-1.

In this study item, different solutions which could facilitate Power
Class 2 FDD-TDD EN-DC High Power UE to comply with applicable SAR
requirement has been throughout studied, with considering the fact that
two kinds of UE implementations could exist, i.e., UE implementation
case 1 with power class 3 capability for both LTE and NR, and case 2
with power class 3 capability for LTE and power class 2 capability for
NR.

The scheme 1, 2, 3 provided in Clause 6 are UE capability reporting
based solutions for SAR limitation compliance designed for PC2 FDD-TDD
EN-DC HPUE. Particularly, the scheme 2 introduces the UE capability
reporting containing the upper limit(s) for the configurable UL duty
cycle for NR TDD carrier under the certain pre-defined LTE
configuration(s) with upper limit(s) on the ratio of accumulated time
allowed for UE maximum power transmission scheduling over the entire
evaluation period. By comparing proposed schemes, RAN4 conclude that
with introducing the mechanism in scheme 2, network can be indicated
with the proper information to facilitate corresponding network
configuration for PC2 FDD-TDD EN-DC HPUE with the applicable SAR limit
compliance.

During the study item, RAN4 identified that the scheme 2 shall be
introduced for specific FDD+TDD EN-DC band combination(s), and RAN4
observed that detailed signalling design to enable scheme 2 shall have
RAN2 specification impact.

Meanwhile, RAN4 identified that network-configuration-based scheme in
which the HPUE set its total EN-DC power based on higher-layer
signalling could also provide the alternative methodology for PC2
FDD-TDD EN-DC HPUE SAR requirement compliance without explicit 3GPP
specification impact and without need for signalling and cell-group
coordination, while some concern raised for the resultant LTE coverage
reduction, and for the applicable SAR limit compliance..
