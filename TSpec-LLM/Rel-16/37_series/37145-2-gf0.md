 Foreword
========

This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:

**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something

**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something

The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the
context of normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.

The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes
for \"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as
possible, and they are not used in a normative context except in a
direct citation from an external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so
as to maintain continuity of style when extending or modifying the
provisions of such a referenced document.

**should** indicates a recommendation to do something

**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something

**may** indicates permission to do something

**need not** indicates permission not to do something

The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\"
are used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.

**can** indicates that something is possible

**cannot** indicates that something is impossible

The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\"
and \"need not\".

**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a
result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to
happen as a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which
is outside the scope of the present document

**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result
of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document

**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

In addition:

**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement
of fact

**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates
a statement of fact

The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

 1 Scope
=======

The present document specifies radiated test methods and conformance
requirements for 2 types of AAS BS; *hybrid requirements set* which
specify requirements for a *hybrid AAS BS* with both a conducted and a
radiated interface and *OTA requirements set* which specify requirements
for an *OTA AAS BS* which has a radiated interface only.

The *hybrid AAS BS* requirements are specified for E-UTRA AAS Base
Station (BS), the FDD mode of UTRA AAS Base Station (BS), the 1,28 Mcps
TDD mode of UTRA AAS Base Station (BS) in single RAT and any MSR AAS
Base Station (BS) implementation of these RATs including NR operation.

The *OTA AAS BS* requirements are specified for E-UTRA AAS Base Station
(BS), the FDD mode of UTRA AAS Base Station (BS), in single RAT and any
MSR AAS Base Station (BS) implementation of these RATs and/or NR.

The requirements have been derived from, and are consistent with non-AAS
BS specifications in TS 25.104 \[2\], TS 25.105 \[3\], TS 36.104 \[4\]
or TS 37.104 \[5\] and where applicable with the NR specification
TS 38.104 \[33\]. The technical specification TS 37.145 is in 2 parts,
part TS 37.145-1 \[9\] covers conducted requirements and part
TS 37.145-2 (the present document) covers radiated requirements.

The present document does not establish radiated test methods and
conformance requirements for Band 46 operation as it is not supported by
AAS BS. Conducted Band 46 test requirements are still applicable for AAS
BS for protection of and against Band 46 operation, as specified in
TS 37.145-1 \[9\].

The present document does not establish minimum RF characteristics or
minimum performance requirements for Narrow-Band Internet of Things
(NB-IoT) in band, NB-IoT guard band, or standalone NB-IoT operation, for
AAS BS in *single RAT E-UTRA operation* or in *MSR operation* using
E-UTRA.

4.1 Measurement uncertainties and test requirements
---------------------------------------------------

### 4.1.1 General

The requirements of this clause apply to all applicable tests in part 2
of this specification, i.e. to all AAS BS radiated tests.

The minimum requirements for AAS BS radiated requirements are given in
TS 37.105 \[14\] clause 9 and 10 for the radiated transmitter and
radiated receiver characteristics, respectively. Test Tolerances for the
radiated test requirements explicitly stated in part 2 of the present
specification are given in annex C of this specification.

Test Tolerances are individually calculated for each test. The Test
Tolerances are used to relax the minimum requirements to create test
requirements.

When a test requirement differs from the corresponding minimum
requirement, then the Test Tolerance applied for the test is non-zero.
The Test Tolerance for the test and the explanation of how the minimum
requirement has been relaxed by the Test Tolerance are given in annex C.

### 4.1.2 Acceptable uncertainty of Test System

#### 4.1.2.1 General

The maximum acceptable uncertainty of the Test System is specified below
for each test defined explicitly in the present specification, where
appropriate.

The Test System shall enable the stimulus signals in the test case to be
adjusted to within the specified tolerance and the equipment under test
to be measured with an uncertainty not exceeding the specified values.
All tolerances and uncertainties are absolute values, and are valid for
a confidence level of 95 %, unless otherwise stated.

A confidence level of 95 % is the measurement uncertainty tolerance
interval for a specific measurement that contains 95 % of the
performance of a population of test equipment.

For details on measurement uncertainty budget calculation, OTA
measurement methodology description (including calibration and
measurement stage for each test range), MU budget format and its
contributions, refer to TR 37.941 \[38\].

#### 4.1.2.4 Measurement of performance requirement

The measurement uncertainties for the performance requirements are the
same as those quoted in TS 36.141 \[12\] clause 4.2.1.3 and
TS 25.141 \[10\] clause 4.1.4.

### 4.1.3 Interpretation of measurement results

The measurement results returned by the Test System are compared -
without any modification - against the test requirements as defined by
the Shared Risk principle.

The Shared Risk principle is defined in Recommendation
ITU-R M.1545 \[8\].

The actual measurement uncertainty of the Test System for the
measurement of each parameter shall be included in the test report.

The recorded value for the Test System uncertainty shall be, for each
measurement, equal to or lower than the appropriate figure in
clause 4.1.2 of the present document.

If the Test System for a test is known to have a measurement uncertainty
greater than that specified in clause 4.1.2, it is still permitted to
use this apparatus provided that an adjustment is made as follows.

Any additional uncertainty in the Test System over and above that
specified in clause 4.1.2 shall be used to tighten the test requirement,
making the test harder to pass. (For some tests e.g. receiver tests,
this may require modification of stimulus signals). This procedure
(defined in annex C) will ensure that a Test System not compliant with
clause 4.1.2 does not increase the chance of passing a device under test
where that device would otherwise have failed the test if a Test System
compliant with clause 4.1.2 had been used.

4.2 Conducted and radiated requirement reference points
-------------------------------------------------------

AAS BS requirements are defined for two points of reference, signified
by radiated requirements (RIB) and conducted requirements (TAB).

Figure 4.2-1: Radiated and conducted points of reference of hybrid AAS
BS

Figure 4.3-2: Radiated points of reference of OTA AAS BS

Radiated characteristics are defined over the air (OTA) at the *radiated
interface boundary* (RIB). Radiated requirements are also referred to as
OTA requirements. The (spatial) directions in which the OTA requirements
apply are detailed for each requirement.

Some OTA requirements are specified as co-location requirements where
the requirements are specified at the conducted interface of the
*co-location reference antenna*, co-location requirements are further
defined in clause 4.15

Conducted characteristics are defined at individual or groups of *TAB
connectors* at the *transceiver array boundary*, which is the conducted
interface between the transceiver unit array and the composite antenna.

The transceiver unit array is part of the composite transceiver
functionality generating modulated transmit signal structures and
performing receiver combining and demodulation.

The transceiver unit array contains an implementation specific number of
transmitter units and an implementation specific number of receiver
units. Transmitter units and receiver units may be combined into
transceiver units. The transmitter/receiver units have the ability to
receive/send parallel independent modulated symbol streams.

The composite antenna contains a *radio distribution network* (RDN) and
an antenna array. The RDN is a linear passive network that distributes
the RF power between the *transceiver array boundary* and the antenna
array, in an implementation specific way.

How a conducted requirement is applied to the *transceiver array
boundary* is detailed in the respective requirement clause.

The present document details the test requirements of the radiated
requirements only and hence only requires the radiated reference points.

4.3 Base station classes for AAS BS
-----------------------------------

The requirements in this specification apply to AAS BS of Wide Area BS,
Medium Range BS and Local Area BS classes unless otherwise stated.

The base station classes are defined in TS 37.105 \[6\].

4.4 Regional requirements
-------------------------

Some requirements in the present document may only apply in certain
regions either as optional requirements, or set by local and regional
regulation as mandatory requirements. It is normally not stated in the
3GPP specifications under what exact circumstances that the requirements
apply, since this is defined by local or regional regulation.

Table 4.4-1 lists all requirements in the present specification that may
be applied differently in different regions. Non-AAS requirements are
applicable as defined in the present document. In many cases, such
requirements include regional requirements that are implicitly
referenced from the present specification, and listed in the
specification for the specifications concerned \[2\] \[5\].

  NOTE: AAS BS does not support Band 46 operation, but additional spurious emissions requirements for Band 46 as described in TS 37.104 \[5\] clause 6.6.1.3, are still applicable for AAS BS for protection of Band 46 operation.                                           
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4.5 Operating bands and band categories
---------------------------------------

The operating bands and band categories for AAS BS are the same as for
*non-AAS BS*, as described in TS 37.104 \[6\]. In addition, band
category aspects described in TS 37.141, clauses 4.4.1, 4.4.2 and 4.4.3,
shall apply.

NOTE 1: *AAS BS* does not support GSM, but BC2 is still applicable for
protection of/against GSM operation in BC2 operating bands.

NOTE 2: AAS BS does not support Band 46 (and all its sub-bands defined
in TS 36.104 \[4\]) operation. Conducted Band 46 test requirements are
still applicable for AAS BS for protection of and against Band 46
operation, as specified in TS 37.145-1 \[9\].

4.6 Channel arrangements
------------------------

The channel arrangements for AAS BS are the same as those for UTRA
*non-AAS BS* and E-UTRA *non-AAS BS* as described in TS 37.104 \[5\].

4.7 Requirements for AAS BS capable of multi-band operation
-----------------------------------------------------------

For AAS BS capable of operation in multiple operating bands, the RF
requirements in clause 6 and 7 apply separately to each supported
operating band unless otherwise stated.

A *hybrid AAS BS* may be capable of supporting operation in multiple
operating bands with one of the following implementations of *TAB
connectors* in the *transceiver array boundary*:

\- All TAB connectors are single band TAB connectors.

\- Different sets of *single band TAB connectors* support different
operating bands, but each *TAB connector* supports only operation in one
single operating band.

\- Sets of *single band TAB connectors* support operation in multiple
operating bands with some *single band TAB connectors* supporting more
than one operating band.

\- All TAB connectors are multiband TAB connectors.

\- A combination of single band sets and multi-band sets of *TAB
connectors* provides support of the *hybrid AAS BS* capability of
operation in multiple operating bands.

Unless otherwise stated all requirements specified for an operating band
apply only to the set of *TAB connectors* supporting that operating
band.

In certain requirements it is explicitly stated that specific additions
or exclusions to the requirement apply at *multi-band TAB connectors* as
detailed in the requirement subclause. When referencing the NR
specification 3GPP TS 38.104 \[33\] for a BS type 1-H the multi-band
connector term is equivalent to a *multi-band TAB connector* in this
specification.

In the case of an operating band being supported only by single band TAB
connectors in a TAB connector TX min cell group or a TAB connector RX
min cell group, single band requirements apply to that set of TAB
connectors.

NOTE: Each supported operating band needs to be operated separately
during conformance testing on *single band TAB connectors*.

For a band supported by a *TAB connector* where the transmitted carriers
are not processed in active RF components together with carriers in any
other band, TX *single band requirements* shall apply. For a band
supported by a *TAB connector* where the received carriers are not
processed in active RF components together with carriers in any other
band, RX *single band requirements* shall apply.

In the case of an operating band being supported only by *multi-band TAB
connector*s supporting the same operating band combination in a *TAB
connector TX min cell group* or a *TAB connector RX min cell group*,
*multi-band requirements* apply to that set of *TAB connectors*.

The case of an operating band being supported by both *multi-band TAB
connectors* and *single band TAB connectors* in a *TAB connector TX min
cell group* or a *TAB connector RX min cell group* is not covered by the
present release of this specification.

The case of an operating band being supported by *multi-band TAB
connectors* which are not all supporting the same operating band
combination in a *TAB connector TX min cell group* or a *TAB connector
RX min cell group* is not covered by the present release of this
specification.

An *OTA AAS BS* may be capable of supporting operation in multiple
operating bands with one of the following implementations at the
*radiated interface boundary*:

\- All RIBs are single band RIBs.

\- All RIBs are *multiband RIBs*.

\- A combination of *single band RIBs* and *multi-band RIBs* provides
support of the *OTA AAS BS* capability of operation in multiple
operating bands.

In certain requirements it is explicitly stated that specific additions
or exclusions to the requirement apply at *multi-band RIBs* as detailed
in the requirement subclause.

NOTE: Each supported operating band needs to be operated separately
during conformance testing for single RIBs.

For *multi-band TAB connectors* and *multi-band RIBs* supporting the
bands for TDD, the RF requirements in the present specification assume
no simultaneous uplink and downlink occur between the bands.

The RF requirements for *multi-band TAB connectors* and *multi-band
RIBs* supporting bands for both FDD and TDD are not covered by the
present release of this specification.

A RIB may operate multi-RAT where the individual RATs are operated in
different RAT specific bands that partially or fully overlap; Δf~OBUE~
and Δf~OOB~ are according to the combined frequency range occupied by
the overlapping bands.

4.8 AAS BS configurations
-------------------------

### 4.8.1 Transmit configurations

Unless otherwise stated, the radiated transmitter characteristics in
clause 6 are specified at the *radiated interface boundary* (RIB). The
AAS BS shall have a full complement of transceiver units for the
configuration in normal operating conditions.

Figure 4.8.1-1: Transmitter test interfaces

Figure 4.8.1-2: Transmitter test interfaces for co-location concept

### 4.8.2 Receive configurations

Unless otherwise stated, the radiated receiver characteristics in
clause 7 are specified at the *radiated interface boundary* (RIB). The
AAS BS shall have a full complement of transceiver units for the
configuration in normal operating conditions.

Figure 4.8.2-1: Receiver test interfaces

Figure 4.8.2-2: Receiver test interfaces for co-location concept

### 4.8.3 Power supply options

If the AAS BS is supplied with a number of different power supply
configurations, it may not be necessary to test RF parameters for each
of the power supply options, provided that it can be demonstrated that
the range of conditions over which the equipment is tested is at least
as great as the range of conditions due to any of the power supply
configurations.

### 4.8.4 BS with integrated Iuant BS modem

Unless otherwise stated, for the tests in the present document, the
integrated Iuant BS modem shall be switched OFF.

4.9 Capability sets
-------------------

A radiated capability set is defined as the AAS BS capability to support
certain RAT combinations in an operating band.

The manufacturer shall declare (D9.25) the supported radiated capability
set(s) according to table 4.9-1 for each supported operating band.

The applicable test configurations for each RF requirement are defined
in clause 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 for the declared radiated capability set(s).
For beams with multi-band beam dependencies the applicable test
configurations for each RF requirement are defined in clause 5.4 for the
declared radiated capability set(s).

NOTE: Not every supported configuration within a capability set is
tested, but the tables in clauses 5.2, 5.3 and 5.4 provide a judicious
choice among the supported configurations and test configurations to
ensure proper test coverage.

4.10 Manufacturer declarations
------------------------------

The AAS BS declarations categories D9.x and D10.x listed in table 4.10-1
are required to be provided by the manufacturer for the radiated
requirements testing of the *hybrid AAS BS* or the OTA AAS BS.

For the *hybrid AAS BS* declarations required for the conducted
requirements testing, refer to TS 37.145-1 \[9\], clause 4.10.

NOTE 1: D9.x declarations are related to the radiated Tx requirements,
while D10.x declarations are related to the radiated Rx requirements.

NOTE 2: From Rel-15 onwards, additional D11.x declarations are
introduced in table 4.10-2 for OTA AAS BS, in order to easily
distinguish from the Rel-13/14 OTA declarations which are also
applicable for *hybrid AAS BS*. Declarations in table 4.10-2 are
applicable to OTA AAS BS only.

the power allocated per carrier for the RAT on which modulation quality
is measured shall be the highest possible for the given modulation
configuration according to the manufacturer's declarations in subclause
4.10, unless that power is higher than the level defined by case a). The
power of the remaining carriers from other RAT(s) shall be set to the
same level as in case a).

If in the case of b) the power of one RAT needs to be reduced in order
to meet the manufacture's declaration the power in the other RAT(s) does
not need to be increased.

4.12 RF channels and test models
--------------------------------

### 4.12.1 RF channels

For single carrier tests unless otherwise stated the tests shall be
performed with a single carrier at each of the RF channels B, M and T.

Many tests in this TS are performed with the maximum radiated *Base
Station RF Bandwidth* located at the bottom, middle and top of the
supported frequency range in the operating band. These are denoted as
B~RFBW~ (bottom), M~RFBW~ (middle) and T~RFBW~ (top).

\- Unless otherwise stated, the test shall be performed at B~RFBW~,
M~RFBW~ and T~RFBW~ defined as following:

\- B~RFBW~: maximum *Base Station RF Bandwidth* located at the bottom of
the supported frequency range in the operating band.

\- M~RFBW~: maximum *Base Station RF Bandwidth* located in the middle of
the supported frequency range in the operating band. M~RFBW~ may be
shifted maximum 100 kHz towards lower frequencies to align carriers with
the channel raster.

\- T~RFBW~: maximum *Base Station RF Bandwidth* located at the top of
the supported frequency range in the operating band.

For the test of certain RF requirements the present specification refers
to test procedures defined in the single-RAT
specifications \[2\], \[3\], \[4\], \[5\]. In this case, the
interpretation of the RF channels to be tested shall be according to the
definitions in the corresponding single-RAT
specifications \[2\], \[3\], \[4\], \[5\].

For an operating band which has multi-band beam dependencies capable of
dual-band operation, unless otherwise stated, the test shall be
performed at B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ defined as
following:

\- B~RFBW~\_ T\'~RFBW~: the *Base Station RF Bandwidths* located at the
bottom of the supported frequency range in the lower operating band and
at the highest possible simultaneous frequency position, within the
maximum *Radio Bandwidth*, in the upper operating band.

\- B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW:~ the *Base Station RF Bandwidths* located at the
top of the supported frequency range in the upper operating band and at
the lowest possible simultaneous frequency position, within the maximum
*Radio Bandwidth*, in the lower operating band.

NOTE: B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ = B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ = B~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ when
the declared maximum radiated *Radio Bandwidth* (see table 4.10-1,
D9.17) spans both operating bands. B~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ means the *Base
Station RF Bandwidths* are located at the bottom of the supported
frequency range in the lower operating band and at the top of the
supported frequency range in the upper operating band.

When a test is performed by a test laboratory, the position of B~RFBW~,
M~RFBW~ and T~RFBW~ in each supported operating band, the position of
B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ in the supported operating
band combinations shall be specified by the laboratory. The laboratory
may consult with operators, the manufacturer or other bodies.

4.13 Format and interpretation of tests
---------------------------------------

Each test in the following clauses has a standard format:

X Title

All tests are applicable to all equipment within the scope of the
present document, unless otherwise stated.

X.1 Definition and applicability

This clause gives the general definition of the parameter under
consideration and specifies whether the test is applicable to all
equipment or only to a certain subset. Required manufacturer
declarations may be included here.

X.2 Minimum requirement

This clause contains the reference to the clause to the 3GPP reference
(or core) specification which defines the minimum requirement. For each
requirement, there are separate references for MSR and single RAT, where
applicable in the core requirement. If the requirement does not apply to
a particular RAT, this is explicitly stated here (rather than through a
reference).

X.3 Test purpose

This clause defines the purpose of the test.

X.4 Method of test

X.4.1 General

In some cases there are alternative test procedures or initial
conditions. In such cases, guidance for which initial conditions and
test procedures can be applied are stated here. In the case only one
test procedure is applicable, that is stated here.

X.4.2y First test method

X.4.2y.1 Initial conditions

This clause defines the initial conditions for each test, including the
test environment, the RF channels to be tested and the basic measurement
set-up. The test system is assumed to be correctly calibrated as part of
the initial conditions. Calibration is not explicitly mentioned.

X.4.2y.2 Procedure

This clause describes the steps necessary to perform the test and
provides further details of the test definition like point of access
(e.g. test port), domain (e.g. frequency-span), range, weighting (e.g.
bandwidth), and algorithms (e.g. averaging). The procedure may comprise
data processing of the measurement result before comparison with the
test requirement (e.g. average result from several measurement
positions).

X.4.3y Alternative test method (if any)

If there are alternative test methods, each is described with its
initial conditions and procedures.

X.5 Test requirement

This clause defines the pass/fail criteria for the equipment under test,
see clause 4.1.3 Interpretation of measurement results. Test
requirements for every minimum requirement referred in clause X.2 are
listed here. Cases where minimum requirements do not apply need not be
mentioned.

The test requirements may be different depending on the test method
applied. A test requirement for each test method applicable to the
respective MSR/Single RAT requirement is given in separate clauses where
applicable.

4.14 Reference coordinate system
--------------------------------

Radiated requirements are stated in terms of electromagnetic
characteristics (e.g. EIRP and EIS) at certain angles with respect to
the base station. To be able to declare radiated characteristics part of
radiated requirements a reference coordinate system is required. The
reference coordinate system is should be associated to an identifiable
physical feature on the base station enclosure.. The location of the
origin and the orientation of the reference coordinate system are for
the base station manufacturer to declare.

The reference coordinate system is created of a Cartesian coordinate
system with rectangular axis (x***,*** y***,*** z) and spherical angles
(θ, φ) as showed in figure 4.14-1.

![](media/image12.emf){width="3.9375in" height="4.072916666666667in"}

Figure 4.14-1: Reference coordinate system

φ*** ***is the angle in the x/y plane, between the x-axis and the
projection of the radiating vector onto the x/y plane and is defined
between -180° and +180°, inclusive. θ*** *** is the angle between the
projection of the vector in the x***/***y plane and the radiating vector
and is defined between -90° and +90°, inclusive. Note that θ is defined
as positive along the down-tilt angle.

4.15 Co-location requirements
-----------------------------

### 4.15.1 General

Co-location requirements are requirements which are based on assuming
the AAS BS is co-located with another BS of the same base station class.
They ensure that both co-located systems can operate with minimal
degradation to each other.

The co-location requirements in Table 4.15-1-1 rely on a *co-location
reference antenna* used to mimic a base station to base station
co-location scenario.

Table 4.15-1-1: Co-location requirements

+---------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+
| Clause number | Requirement    | Co-location    | Type           |
|               |                | reference      |                |

|               |                | signal         |                |
+---------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+

The OTA Transmit ON/OFF power requirement and OTA Transmitter
intermodulation requirement are mandatory requirements where the test
requirement is derived using the *co-location reference antenna*, which
represents the worst-case scenario.

The *co-location reference antenna* is defined in TS 37.105\[6\].

### 4.15.2 Co-location test antenna

#### 4.15.2.1 General

Co-location requirements are specified as power levels into or out of
the conducted interface of the *co-location reference antenna*. For
conformance testing the requirements are translated to the input or
output of a *co-location* test antenna (CLTA).

A CLTA is a practical antenna which can be used to test conformance to
the co-location requirements.

#### 4.15.2.2 Co-location test antenna characteristics

A co-location test antenna is a practical passive antenna that is used
for conformance testing of the co-location requirements and is based on
the definition of the *co-location reference antenna*. A CLTA shall
comply to the requirements specified in Table 4.15.2.2-1. Translation of
the requirements to other test antennas is not precuded but suitable
translations between the *co-location reference antenna* and test
antennas must be provided to demonstrate that the method is within the
specified MU.

The currently defined CLTAs are suitable for testing AAS BSs implemented
with a planar antenna array. The method for testing AAS BS with other
antenna array implementations is FFS.

5 Applicability of Requirements
===============================

5.1 General
-----------

The present clause defines for each radiated test requirement the set of
mandatory test configurations which shall be used for demonstrating
conformance for radiated requirement.

Test configurations for beams supporting multiple RAT in the tested
operating band are specified in clause 5.1.

Test configurations for radiated requirements where the operating band
has been declared to support single RAT requirements (see table 4.10-1,
D9.5) by either MSR requirements for UTRA only or E-UTRA only or with a
single-RAT UTRA requirements or single RAT E-UTRA requirements are
specified in subclause 5.2.

Test configurations for an AAS BS with operating bands which have
multi-band dependencies are specified in clause 5.3.

Requirements apply to AAS BS according to the declared RAT radiated
Capability Set (see table 4.10-1, D9.25) within each supported operating
band the Band Category of the declared operating band (see table 4.10-1,
D9.4), as listed in the heading of each table. Some RF requirements
listed in the tables may not be mandatory or they may apply only
regionally. This is further specified for each requirement in clauses 6
and 7, and in table 4.4-1.

For a declared RAT radiated Capability Set (see table 4.10-1, D9.25) in
tables 5.2-1, 5.3.2-1, 5.3.3-1, 5.3.4-1, 5.4.1-1 or 5.4.2-1 only the
requirements listed in the column for that radiated Capability Set
apply. Requirements listed under RCSA other than the declared RCSA(s)
need not be tested. In case the BS is declared to support more than one
CS, the tests that are common between different supported CSs are not
repeated.

An AAS BS where the operating band is declared: to support multiple RATs
(MSR) and to be capable of contiguous spectrum operation only, the test
configuration(s) in tables 5.2-1 and 5.3.2-1 denoted by a \"C\" and
entries that refer to single-RAT specifications shall be used for
testing.

An AAS BS where the operating band is declared: to support multiple RATs
(MSR), to be capable of contiguous and non-contiguous spectrum operation
(see table 4.10-1, D9.28), where the parameters according to clause 4.10
are identical for contiguous and non-contiguous operation (see table
4.10-1, D9.29). Shall use for each declared operating band the test
configuration(s) in tables 5.2-1 and 5.3.2-1 denoted by \"CNC\" and
entries that refer to single-RAT specifications shall be used.

An AAS BS where the operating band is declared: to support multiple RATs
(MSR), to be capable of contiguous and non-contiguous spectrum operation
(see table 4.10-1, D9.28), where the parameters according to clause 4.10
are not identical for contiguous and non-contiguous operation (see table
4.10-1, D9.29). Shall use for each declared operating band the test
configuration(s) in tables 5.2-1 and 5.3.2-1 denoted by \"C/NC\" and
entries that refer to single-RAT specifications shall be used.

For an AAS BS operating bands which have multi-band dependencies which
is MSR capable the applicability of the requirement for each operating
band is determined by the RAT configuration within that operating band
as identified in tables 5.2-1 and 5.3.2-1, unless otherwise stated. The
testing of an AAS BS in operating bands with multi-band dependencies
which are MSR capable shall be according to table 5.4.1-1 as follows:

\- For requirements test denoted by SBT (Single Band Test), the test
configuration (s) in tables 5.2-1 and 5.3.2-1 shall be used for each
operating band depending on the RAT configuration within that band.

\- For requirements test denoted by MBT (Multi-Band Test), the test
configuration (s) in table 5.4.1-1 shall be used depending on the Band
Category of the declared operating band combination.

For a single--RAT UTRA only operating bands clause 5.3.3 defines for
each radiated test requirement the set of mandatory test configurations
which shall be used for demonstrating conformance. The applicable test
configurations are specified in table 5.3.3-1 for each supported RF
configuration, which shall be declared according to clause 4.10. The
generation and EIRP allocation for each test configuration is defined in
clause 4.11.2.

For a single-RAT E-UTRA only operating bands clause 5.3.4 defines for
each radiated test requirement the set of mandatory test configurations
which shall be used for demonstrating conformance. The applicable test
configurations are specified in table 5.3.4-1 for each supported RF
configuration, which shall be declared according to clause 4.10. The
generation and EIRP allocation for each test configuration is defined in
clause 4.11.3.

For an AAS BS operating band declared to be capable of single carrier
operation only (see table 4.10-1, D9.4), a single carrier (SC) shall be
used for testing.

In Table 5.1-1, the requirement applicability for each requirement set
is defined. For each requirement, the applicable requirement clause in
the specification is identified. Requirements not included in a
requirement set is marked not applicable (NA).

5.3 Test configurations for multi-carrier capable AAS BS in operating bands where one RAT capability sets are supported
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 5.3.1 General

An AAS BS may support only one RAT operation in an operating band by
fulfilling different sets of requirements. Both UTRA and E-UTRA have two
complete sets of requirements that may be fulfilled depending on whether
the beam is declared to be MSR or single RAT in the operating band. MSR
and single RAT requirements are addressed separately by separate test
requirements (and corresponding core requirements). They are also
identified by different capability sets as described in clauses 4.11 and
5.2.

### 5.3.2 AAS BS supporting one RAT only MSR in the operating band

This clause contains test configuration applicability to requirements
and capability sets for AAS BS supporting one RAT only MSR operation
operating with multiple carriers (MC).

and capability sets for operating bands supporting one RAT only MSR
operation

### 5.3.3 AAS BS supporting Single-RAT UTRA in the operating band

This clause contains the test configurations for AAS BS supporting
single-RAT UTRA in the operating band. The test configurations apply to
beams operating with multiple carriers (MC).

For an AAS BS declared to support multi-carrier operation in contiguous
spectrum operation in single band only, the test configurations in the
second column of table 5.3.3-1 for FDD, and in the fifth column of
table 5.3.3-1 for TDD, shall be used for testing.

NOTE: The applicability of test configurations for TDD in this clause is
only applicable to UTRA TDD 1,28 Mcps option.

For FDD an AAS BS declared to support multi-carrier operation in
contiguous and non-contiguous spectrum in single band and where the
parameters in the manufacture\'s declaration according to clause 4.10
are identical for contiguous (C) and non-contiguous (NC) spectrum
operation, the test configurations in the third column of table 5.3.3-1
shall be used for testing.

For FDD an AAS BS declared to support multi-carrier operation in
contiguous and non-contiguous spectrum in single band and where the
parameters in the manufacture\'s declaration according to clause 4.10
are not identical for contiguous and non-contiguous spectrum operation,
the test configurations in the fourth column of table 5.3.3-1 shall be
used for testing.

### 5.3.4 AAS BS supporting Single-RAT E-UTRA in the operating band

This clause contains the test configurations for AAS BS supporting
single-RAT E-UTRA in the operating band. The test configurations apply
to AAS BS operating bands operating with multiple carriers (MC).

For an AAS BS declared to support multi-carrier and/or CA operation in
contiguous spectrum operation in single band only, the test
configurations in the second column of table 5.3.4-1 shall be used for
testing.

For an AAS BS declared to support multi-carrier and/or CA operation in
contiguous and non-contiguous spectrum in single band and where the
parameters in the manufacture\'s declaration according to clause 4.10
are identical for contiguous (C) and non-contiguous (NC) spectrum
operation, the test configurations in the third column of table 5.3.4-1
shall be used for testing.

For an AAS BS declared to support multi-carrier and/or CA in contiguous
and non-contiguous spectrum in single band and where the parameters in
the manufacture\'s declaration according to clause 4.10 are not
identical for contiguous and non-contiguous spectrum operation, the test
configurations in the fourth column of table 5.3.4-1 shall be used for
testing.

6 Radiated transmitter characteristics
======================================

6.1 General
-----------

General test conditions for transmitter tests are given in clause 4,
including interpretation of measurement results and configuration for
testing. AAS BS configurations for the tests are defined in clause 4.8.

If beams have been declared equivalent and parallel (see table 4.10-1,
D9.12, D9.13), only a representative beam is necessary to be tested to
demonstrate conformance. *The manufacturer shall declare the minimum
number of supported geographical cells (i.e. geographical areas). The
minimum number of supported geographical cells (N~cells~) relates to the
AAS BS setting with the minimum amount of cell splitting supported.*

*OTA AAS BS* transmitter requirements apply per geographical cell.

Any radiated transmitter test requirement specified in TS 37.105 \[6\]
is not applicable for AAS BS operation in Band 46.

For OTA base station output power (clause 6.3), OTA transmit ON/OFF
power (clause 6.5), OTA unwanted emissions requirements (clause 6.7) and
OTA receiver spurious emissions (clause 7.7), TRP is defined in
spherical coordinates as:

, where P~D~(r,θ,ϕ) is the power density in W/m^2^ of two orthogonal
polarizations at a distance r (meters).

NOTE: General TRP expression that is obtained by integrating the
Poynting vector over a spherical surface.

6.2 Radiated Transmit Power
---------------------------

### 6.2.1 Definition and applicability

This is an output power accuracy requirement defined at the RIB during
the *transmitter ON period*.

An AAS BS is declared to support one or more beams. Radiated transmit
power is defined as the EIRP level for a declared beam at a specific
*beam peak direction*.

For each beam, the requirement is based on declarations (see table
4.10-1) of a beam identifier (D9.3), *reference beam direction pair*
(D9.7), *rated beam EIRP* (D9.10) at the *reference beam direction
pair*, *OTA peak directions set* (D9.8), the *beam direction pairs* at
the maximum steering directions (D9.9) and their associated *rated beam
EIRP* and *beamwidth(s)* (D9.11) for *reference beam direction pair* and
maximum steering directions.

For a declared beam identifier and *beam direction pair*, the *rated
beam EIRP* level is the maximum power that the base station is declared
to radiate at the associated *beam peak direction* during the
*transmitter ON period*.

For each *beam peak direction* associated with a *beam direction pair*
within the *OTA peak directions set*, a specific *rated beam EIRP* level
may be claimed. Any claimed value shall be met within the accuracy
requirement as described below. *Rated beam EIRP* is only required to be
declared for the *beam direction pairs* subject to conformance testing
as detailed in clause 6.2.4.1.

NOTE 1: The *OTA peak directions set* for a beam is the complete
continuous or discrete set of all *beam direction* for which the EIRP
accuracy is intended to be achieved for the beam.

NOTE 2: A beam direction pair consists of a beam centre direction and an
associated beam peak direction.

NOTE 3: A declared EIRP value is a value provided by the manufacturer
for verification according to the conformance specification declaration
requirements, whereas a claimed EIRP value is provided by the
manufacturer to the equipment user for normal operation of the equipment
and is not subject to formal conformance testing.

For *operating bands* where the supported *fractional bandwidth* (FBW)
is larger than 6%, two rated carrier EIRP may be declared by
manufacturer:

\- P~rated,c,FBWlow~ for lower supported frequency range, and

\- P~rated,c,FBWhigh~ for higher supported frequency range.

For frequencies in between F~FBWlow~ and F~FBWhigh~ the rated carrier
EIRP is:

\- P~rated,c,FBWlow,~ for the carrier whose carrier frequency is within
frequency range F~FBWlow~ ≤ f \< (F~FBWlow~ +F~FBWhigh~) / 2,

\- P~rated,c,FBWhigh,~ for the carrier whose carrier frequency is within
frequency range (F~FBWlow~ +F~FBWhigh~) / 2 ≤ f ≤F~FBWhigh~.

### 6.2.2 Minimum Requirement

For AAS BS in *MSR operation* the minimum requirement is defined in
TS 37.105 \[6\], clause 9.2.2.

For AAS BS in *single RAT UTRA operation* the minimum requirement is
defined in TS 37.105 \[6\], clause 9.2.3.

For AAS BS in *single RAT E-UTRA operation* the minimum requirement is
defined in TS 37.105 \[6\], clause 9.2.4.

### 6.2.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify the ability to accurately generate and
direct radiated power per beam, across the frequency range and under
normal conditions, for all declared beams of the AAS BS.

### 6.2.4 Method of test

#### 6.2.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment:

\- Extreme (applies only to OTA AAS BS), see annexes G.3 and G.5.

RF bandwidth positions to be tested: B~RFBW~, M~RFBW~ and T~RFBW~ in
single-band operation, see clause 4.12.1.

B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ in multi-band operation, see
clause 4.12.1.

Directions to be tested:

\- The reference beam direction pair (D9.7)

\- The maximum steering directions (D9.9).

Beams to be tested:

\- the beams with highest rated beam EIRP, P~rated,c,FBWlow~ (D11.33)
and P~rated,c,FBWhigh~ (D11.34), if these are provided.

Under extreme test environment, for OTA AAS BS only, it is sufficient to
test on one RF channel or one *Base Station RF Bandwidth* position, and
with one applicable test configuration defined in clauses 4.11 and 5.
The direction to be tested is only at *reference beam direction pair*
(D9.7). Testing shall be performed under extreme power supply
conditions, as defined in annex G.5.

NOTE: Tests under extreme power supply conditions also test extreme
temperatures.

#### 6.2.4.2 Procedure

1\) Place the AAS BS at the positioner.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation (see
table 4.10-1, D9.2) of the AAS BS with the test system.

3\) Orient the positioner (and BS) in order that the direction to be
tested aligns with the test antenna.

4\) Configure the beam peak direction of the AAS BS according to the
declared beam direction pair.

5\) Set the base station to transmit according to the applicable test
configuration in clause 5 using the corresponding test model(s) in
clause 4.12.2.

In addition, for an AAS BS declared to be capable of multi-carrier
and/or CA operation use the applicable test signal configuration and
corresponding power setting specified in clause 4.11.

6\) Measure EIRP for any two orthogonal polarizations (denoted p1 and
p2) and calculate total radiated transmit power for particular *beam
direction pair* as EIRP = EIRP~p1~ + EIRP~p2~.

4.10-1, D9.3) and their reference beam direction pairs and *maximum
steering directions* (see table 4.10-1, D9.7 and D9.11).

For multi-band capable AAS BS and single band tests, repeat the steps
above per involved band where single band test configurations and test
models shall apply with no carriers activated in the other band.

8\) For extreme conditions tests the methods in annex B.7 may be used
where a representative power measurement is taken at both nominal
conditions (P~max,sample,nom~) and extreme conditions
(P~max,sample,ext~) and the delta (Δ~sample~) is added to the nominal
measurement from step 6 such that P~max,c,EIRP,\ extreme~ =
P~max,c,EIRP~ + Δ~sample~.

As the requirement is TRP the beam pattern(s) may be set up to optimise
the TRP measurement procedure (see annex F).

##### 6.3.2.4.2 Procedure

The following procedure for measuring TRP is based on the directional
power measurements as described in in Annex F. An alternative method to
measure TRP is to use a characterized and calibrated reverberation
chamber. If so follow steps 1, 4, 5, and 7. When calibrated and operated
within the guidance of 3GPP TR 37.941 \[38\] the measurement methods are
applicable and selected depending on availability at the test facility.

during the power measurement step 6 are consistent with the grid and
measurement approach for the TRP test.

configuration in clause 5 using the corresponding test model(s) in
clause 4.12.2.

In addition, for an AAS BS declared to be capable of multi-carrier
and/or CA operation use the applicable test signal configuration and
corresponding power setting specified in clause 4.11.

5\) Orient the positioner (and BS) in order that the direction to be
tested aligns with the test antenna such that measurements to determine
TRP can be performed (see annex F).

6\) Measure the radiated power for any two orthogonal polarizations
(denoted p1 and p2) and calculate total radiated transmit power for
particular beam direction pair as EIRP = EIRPp1 + EIRPp2.

If the test chamber is a reverberation chamber measure TRP directly.

7\) Measure EIRP for any two orthogonal polarizations (denoted p1 and
p2) and calculate total radiated transmit power for particular *beam
direction pair* as EIRP = EIRP~p1~ + EIRP~p2~.

#### 6.4.3.5 Test Requirement

For UTRA FDD the test requirement Inner loop power control is:

Downlink (DL) power control dynamic range:

\- maximum code domain power: maximum EIRP (P~max,c,EIRP~) --4.1 dB or
greater;

\- minimum code domain power: maximum EIRP (P~max,c,EIRP~) --26.9 dB or
less.

NOTE: If the above Test Requirement differs from the Minimum Requirement
then the Test Tolerance applied for this test is non-zero. The Test
Tolerance for this test is defined in clause 4.1.2 and the explanation
of how the Minimum Requirement has been relaxed by the Test Tolerance is
given in annex C.

### 6.4.4 OTA total power dynamic range

#### 6.4.4.1 Definition and applicability

The total power dynamic range is the difference between the maximum and
the minimum output power for a specified reference condition.

This requirement applies at each RIB supporting transmission in the
operating band.

NOTE 1: The upper limit of the dynamic range is the BS maximum carrier
EIRP (P~max,c,EIRP~). The lower limit of the dynamic range is the lowest
minimum power from the AAS BS when no traffic channels are activated in
the same direction using the same beam.

Particularly for E-UTRA, the total power dynamic range is the difference
between the maximum and the minimum transmit power of an OFDM symbol for
a specified reference condition.

NOTE 2: The upper limit of the dynamic range at a RIB is the OFDM symbol
power at maximum carrier EIRP (P~max,c,EIRP~) when transmitting on all
RBs. The lower limit of the dynamic range at a RIB is the OFDM symbol
power when one resource block is transmitted. The OFDM symbol carries
PDSCH or sPDSCH (for sTTI) and not contain RS, PBCH or synchronization
signals in the same direction using the same beam.

#### 6.4.4.2 Minimum Requirement

For AAS BS in *MSR operation* the minimum requirement is defined in
TS 37.105 \[6\], clause 9.4.4.2.

For AAS BS in *single RAT UTRA operation* the minimum requirement is
defined in TS 37.105 \[6\], clause 9.4.4.3.

For AAS BS in *single RAT E-UTRA operation* the minimum requirement is
defined in TS 37.105 \[6\], clause 9.4.4.4.

The minimum requirement for NR operation is in TS 38.104 \[33\],

### 6.5.1 General

OTA transmitter ON/OFF power requirements apply only to TDD operation of

Station RF Bandwidth*(s) centred on the central frequency of the *Base
Station RF Bandwidth* (s) during the *transmitter OFF period*. For UTRA
and E-UTRA, N=1. For NR, N = SCS/15, where SCS is Sub Carrier Spacing in
kHz.

For multi-band RIBs and single band RIBs supporting transmission in

6.7 OTA Unwanted Emissions
--------------------------

### 6.7.1 General

Unwanted emissions consist of so-called out-of-band emissions and
spurious emissions according to ITU definitions TS 25.331 \[15\]. In ITU
terminology, out of band emissions are unwanted emissions immediately
outside the *channel bandwidth* resulting from the modulation process
and non-linearity in the transmitter but excluding spurious emissions.
Spurious emissions are emissions which are caused by unwanted
transmitter effects such as harmonics emission, parasitic emission,
intermodulation products and frequency conversion products, but exclude
out of band emissions.

OTA unwanted emissions for *OTA AAS BS* in *single RAT E-UTRA operation*
and *MSR operation* using E-UTRA consist of an OTA operating band
unwanted emissions requirement and OTA spurious emissions requirement.
OTA operating band unwanted emissions requirement defines limits for
emissions in each supported *downlink operating band* plus the frequency
ranges Δf~OBUE~ above and Δf~OBUE~ below each band, where Δf~OBUE~ is
the maximum offset of the operating band unwanted emission mask from the
operating band edge. Emissions outside of this frequency range are
limited by OTA spurious emissions requirement.

The values of Δf~OBUE~ are defined for OTA AAS BS for E-UTRA, NR and
UTRA FDD operating bands in Table 6.7.1-1.

Table 6.7.1-1: Maximum offset of OBUE outside the downlink *operating
band*

  BS type      Operating band characteristics                  Δf~OBUE~ \[MHz\]
  ------------ ----------------------------------------------- ------------------
  OTA AAS BS   F~DL\_high~ -- F~DL\_low~ \< 100 MHz            10
               100 MHz ≤ F~DL\_high~ -- F~DL\_low~ ≤ 900 MHz   40

OTA unwanted emissions for *OTA AAS BS* in *single UTRA operation* and
*MSR operation* using UTRA consist of OTA spectrum emission mask
requirement and OTA spurious emissions requirement.

NOTE: For definitions of conducted unwanted emissions requirements refer
to clause 6.6 in TS 37.145‑1 \[9\].

The unwanted emission requirements are applied per cell for all the
configurations supported by *OTA AAS BS*. Requirements for OTA unwanted
emissions are captured using TRP, *directional requirements* or
co-location requirements as described per requirement.

There is in addition a requirement for occupied bandwidth and an ACLR
requirement.

### 6.7.2 OTA occupied bandwidth

#### 6.7.2.1 Definition and applicability

The OTA occupied bandwidth is the width of a frequency band such that,
below the lower and above the upper frequency limits, the mean powers
emitted are each equal to a specified percentage β/2 of the total mean
transmitted power. See also recommendation ITU-R SM.328 \[14\].

The value of β/2 shall be taken as 0.5%.

The OTA occupied bandwidth requirement applies during the *transmitter
ON period* for a single transmitted carrier. The minimum requirement
below may be applied regionally. There may also be regional requirements
to declare the OTA occupied bandwidth according to the definition in the
present clause.

The OTA occupied bandwidth is defined as a *directional requirement* and
shall be met in the manufacturer\'s declared *OTA coverage range* at the
RIB.

#### 6.7.2.2 Minimum Requirement

For AAS BS in *MSR operation* the minimum requirement is defined in
TS 37.105 \[6\], clause 9.7.2.2.

For AAS BS in *single RAT UTRA operation* the minimum requirement is
defined in TS 37.105 \[6\], clause 9.7.2.3.

For AAS BS in *single RAT E-UTRA operation* the minimum requirement is
defined in TS 37.105 \[6\], clause 9.7.2.4.

#### 6.7.2.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify that the emission at the *RIB* does not
occupy an excessive bandwidth for the service to be provided and is,
therefore, not likely to create interference to other users of the
spectrum beyond undue limits.

#### 6.7.2.4 Method of test

##### 6.7.2.4.1 Initial conditions

##### 6.7.2.4.1.1 General test conditions {#general-test-conditions-1 .H6}

Test environment:

\- normal; see annex G.2.

RF channels to be tested:

\- M; see clause 4.12.1.

Aggregated Channel Bandwidth positions to be tested for contiguous
carrier aggregation: M~BW\ Channel\ CA~

Directions to be tested:

\- The *reference beam direction pair* (see table 4.10-1, D9.7).

##### 6.7.2.4.1.2 UTRA FDD {#utra-fdd-3 .H6}

\- Set the AAS BS to transmit a signal in accordance to TM1in
clause 4.12.2 at manufacturers declared *rated carrier EIRP*
(P~rated,c,EIRP~).

##### 6.7.2.4.1.3 E-UTRA and NR {#e-utra-and-nr-1 .H6}

\- Aggregated Channel Bandwidth positions to be tested for contiguous
carrier aggregation:

\- B~BW\ Channel\ CA~, M~BW\ Channel\ CA~ and T~BW\ Channel\ CA~.

\- For a AAS BS declared to be capable of single carrier operation,
start transmission according to E- TM1.1 or N- TM1.1, clause 4.12.2 at
manufacturers declared *rated carrierEIRP* (P~rated,c,EIRP~).

\- For a AAS BS declared to be capble of contiguas carrier aggregation
operation, set the base station to transmit according to E-TM1.1 or N-
TM1.1, on all carriers configured using the applicable test
configuration and corresponding power setting specified in clause 5

\- For an AAS BS declared to be capable of multi-carrier and/or CA
operation use the applicable test signal configuration and corresponding
power setting specified in clause 4.11.

##### 6.7.2.4.2 Procedure

1\) Place the AAS BS at the positioner.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation (see
table 4.10-1, D9.2) of the AAS BS with the test system.

3\) Orient the positioner (and BS) in order that the direction to be
tested aligns with the test antenna.

4\) Configure the beam peak direction of the AAS BS according to the
declared beam direction pair.

5\) Set the AAS BS to transmit signal.

6\) For UTRA FDD, measure the spectrum of the transmitted signal across
a span of 10 MHz, based on an occupied bandwidth requirement of 5 MHz.
The selected resolution bandwidth (RBW) filter of the analyser shall be
30 kHz or less. The spectrum shall be measured at 400 or more points
across the measurement span.

For E-UTRA and NR measure the spectrum emission of the transmitted
signal using at least the number of measurement points, and across a
span, as listed in table 6.7.2.4.2-1. The selected resolution bandwidth
(RBW) filter of the analyser shall be 30 kHz or less.

NOTE: The detection mode of the spectrum analyzer will not have any
effect on the result if the statistical properties of the out-of-OBW
power are the same as those of the inside-OBW power. Both are expected
to have the Rayleigh distribution of the amplitude of Gaussian noise. In
any case where the statistics are not the same, though, the detection
mode is power responding. There are at least two ways to be power
responding. The spectrum analyser can be set to \"sample\" detection,
with its video bandwidth setting at least three times its RBW setting.
Or the analyser may be set to respond to the average of the power
(root-mean-square of the voltage) across the measurement cell.

measurements for FR1

7\) Compute the total of the EIRP, P0, (in power units, not decibel
units) of all the measurement cells in the measurement span. Compute P1,
the EIRP outside the occupied bandwidth on each side. P1 is half of the
total EIRP outside the bandwidth. P1 is half of (100 % - (occupied
percentage)) of P0. For the occupied percentage of 99 %, P1 is 0.005

##### 6.7.3.4.2 Procedure

##### 6.7.3.4.2.1 General Procedure {#general-procedure-3 .H6}

The following procedure for measuring TRP is based on the directional
power measurements as described in in Annex F. An alternative method to
measure TRP is to use a characterized and calibrated reverberation
chamber. If so, follow steps 1, 3, 4, 6 and 9. When calibrated and
operated within the guidance of 3GPP TR 37.941 \[38\] the measurement
methods are applicable and selected depending on availability at the
test facility.

1\) Place the AAS BS at the positioner.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation (see
table 4.10-1, D9.2) of the AAS BS with the test system.

3\) The measurement devices characteristics shall be:

\- measurement filter bandwidth: defined in clause 6.7.3.5.

\- detection mode: true RMS voltage or true power averaging.

The emission power should be averaged over an appropriate time duration
to ensure the measurement is within the measurement uncertainty in Table
4.1.2.2-1.

4\) For single carrier operation, set the AAS BS to transmit according
to the applicable test configuration in clause 5 using the corresponding
test model(s) in clause 4.12.2 at manufacturers declared *rated carrier
TRP* (P~rated,c,TRP~).

For an AAS BS declared to be capable of multi-carrier and/or CA
operation use the applicable test signal configuration and corresponding
power setting specified in clause 4.11.

5\) Orient the positioner (and BS) in order that the direction to be
tested aligns with the test antenna such that measurements to determine
TRP can be performed (see annex F).

6\) Measure the absolute total power of the assigned channel frequency
and the (adjacent channel frequency)

7\) Repeat step 6-7 for all directions in the appropriated TRP
measurement grid needed for TRP~Estimate~ for each of the assigned
channel frequency and the adjacent channel frequency (see Annex F).

8\) Calculate TRP~Estimate~ for the absolute total radiated power of the
wanted channel and the adjacent channel and the ACLR estimate using the
measurements made in Step 7.

9\) Calculate relative ACLR estimate.

NOTE 1: ACLR is calculated by the ratio of the absolute TRP of the
assigned channel frequency and the absolute TRP of the adjacent
frequency channel.

NOTE 2: For FR1 the measurement uncertainty of the reverberation chamber
for the relative ACLR is higher than the measurement uncertainty in
clause 4.1.2 the test requirements in Table 6.7.3.5.1-1 shall be
tightened following the procedure in clause 4.1.3.

frequency. In multiple carrier case only offset frequencies below the
lowest and above the highest carrier frequency used shall be measured.

2\) For the OTA ACLR requirement applied inside sub-block gap for
non-contiguous spectrum operation or inside *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* for
multi-band operation:

specified in clause 6.7.3.5.2.1, if applicable.

b\) Measure OTA CACLR inside sub-block gap or *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*
as specified in clause 6.7.3.5.2.2, if applicable.

In addition, for *multi-band RIB*, the following steps shall apply:

3\) For *multi-band RIB* and single band tests, repeat the steps above
per involved band where single band test configurations and test models
shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

specified in clause 6.7.3.5.3.1, if applicable.

b\) Measure OTA CACLR inside sub-block gap or *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*
as specified in clause 6.7.3.5.3.2, if applicable.

3\) Repeat the test with the channel set-up according to E- TM1.2 in
clause 4.12.2.

In addition, for *multi-band RIB(s)*, the following steps shall apply:

4\) For *multi-band RIB* and single band tests, repeat the steps above
per involved band where single band test configurations and test models
shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

#### 6.7.3.5 Test Requirement

##### 6.7.3.5.1 MSR

##### 6.7.3.5.1.1 MSR E-UTRA test requirement {#msr-e-utra-test-requirement .H6}

For E-UTRA, the test requirement is specified in tables 6.7.3.5.1.1-1
and 6.7.3.5.1.1-2, and applies outside the *Base Station RF Bandwidth*
or *Maximum Radio Bandwidth*.

For an AAS BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum, the OTA ACLR also
applies for the first adjacent channel inside any sub-block gap with a
gap size W~gap~ ≥ 15 MHz. The OTA ACLR requirement for the second
adjacent channel applies inside any sub-block gap with a gap size W~gap~
≥ 20 MHz. The CACLR test requirement in clause 6.6.3.5.6.2 applies in
sub-block gaps for the frequency ranges defined in table 6.6.3.5.6.2-1.

For a *multi-band RIB*, the ACLR also applies for the first adjacent
channel inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* with a gap size W~gap~ ≥ 15
MHz. The ACLR requirement for the second adjacent channel applies inside
any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* with a gap size W~gap~ ≥ 20 MHz. The OTA
CACLR requirement in clause 6.7.3.5.3.2 applies in *Inter RF Bandwidth
gap*s for the frequency ranges defined in Table 6.7.3.5.3.2-1.

The requirement applies during the transmitter on period.

The OTA ACLR is defined with a square filter of bandwidth equal to the
transmission bandwidth configuration of the transmitted signal
(BW~Config~) centred on the assigned channel frequency and a filter
centred on the adjacent channel frequency according to the tables below.

For operation in paired spectrum, the measurement result shall not be
less than the OTA ACLR limit specified in Table 6.7.3.5.1.1-1.

For an AAS BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum, OTA ACLR requirement
also applies for the first adjacent channel, inside any sub-block gap
with a gap size W~gap~ ≥ 15 MHz. The OTA ACLR requirement for the second
adjacent channel applies inside any sub-block gap with a gap size W~gap~
≥ 20 MHz. The OTA CACLR test requirement in clause 6.7.3.5.3.2 applies
in sub block gaps for the frequency ranges defined in Table
6.7.3.5.3.2-1.

For a multi-band capable AAS BS OTA ACLR requirement also applies for
the first adjacent channel, inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* with a
gap size W~gap~ ≥ 15 MHz. The OTA ACLR requirement for the second
adjacent channel applies inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* with a gap
size W~gap~ ≥ 20 MHz. The OTA CACLR requirement in clause 6.7.3.5.3.2
applies in *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*s for the frequency ranges defined in
Table 6.7.3.5.3.2-1.

For Category A, a UTRA AAS BS of Wide Area BS class, either the OTA ACLR
limits in the Tables 6.7.3.5.1.2-1/2 or the absolute limit of -7 dBm/MHz
shall apply, whichever is less stringent.

For Category B, a UTRA AAS BS of Wide Area BS class, either the OTA ACLR
limits in the Tables 6.7.3.5.1.2-1/2 or the absolute limit of -9 dBm/MHz
shall apply, whichever is less stringent.

For a UTRA AAS BS of Medium Range BS class, either the OTA ACLR limits
in the Tables 6.7.3.5.1.2-1/2 or the absolute limit of -19 dBm/MHz shall
apply, whichever is less stringent.

For a UTRA AAS BS of Local Area BS class, either the OTA ACLR limits in
the Tables 6.7.3.5.1.2-1/2 or the absolute limit of -26 dBm/MHz shall
apply, whichever is less stringent.

##### 6.7.3.5.1.3 OTA Cumulative ACLR test requirement in non-contiguous spectrum {#ota-cumulative-aclr-test-requirement-in-non-contiguous-spectrum .H6}

The following test requirement applies for sub-block or *Inter RF
Bandwidth gap* sizes listed in Table 6.7.3.5.1.3-1:

\- Inside a sub-block gap within an operating band for a BS operating in
non-contiguous spectrum.

\- Inside an *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* for a BS operating in multiple
bands, where multiple bands are mapped on the same antenna connector.

The Cumulative Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (CACLR) in a
sub-block gap or the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* is the ratio of:

a\) the sum of the filtered mean power centred on the assigned channel
frequencies for the two carriers adjacent to each side of the sub-block
gap or the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*; and

b\) the filtered mean power centred on a frequency channel adjacent to
one of the respective sub-block edges or *Base Station RF Bandwidth
edges*.

The requirement applies to adjacent channels of E-UTRA or UTRA carriers
allocated adjacent to each side of the sub‑block gap or the *Inter RF
Bandwidth gap*. The assumed filter for the adjacent channel frequency is
defined in Table 6.7.3.5.1.3-1 and the filters on the assigned channels
are defined in Table 6.7.3.5.1.3-2.

NOTE: If the RAT on the assigned channel frequencies is different, the
filters used are also different.

The CACLR for E-UTRA and UTRA carriers located on either side of the
sub-block gap or the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* shall not be less than the
value specified in Table 6.7.3.5.1.3-1.

6.7.3.5.1.4-1/2a or the OTA ACLR absolute limits in tables 6.7.3.5.1.4-2
shall apply, whichever is less stringent. The OTA CACLR limits in
clause 6.7.3.5.1.3 shall also apply.

For a RIB operating in non-contiguous spectrum, the OTA ACLR requirement
applies inside sub block gaps for the frequency ranges defined in table
6.7.3.5.1.4-2a, while the CACLR requirement applies inside sub block
gaps for the frequency ranges defined in table 6.7.3.5.1.3-1.

For a *multi-band RIB*, the OTA ACLR test requirement applies inside
Inter RF Bandwidth gaps for the frequency ranges defined in table
6.7.3.5.1.4-2a, while the OTA CACLR requirement applies inside Inter RF
Bandwidth gaps for the frequency ranges defined in table 6.7.3.5.1.3-1.

For operation in paired and unpaired spectrum, the OTA ACLR measurement
result shall not be less than the OTA ACLR limit specified in table
6.7.3.5.1.4-1.

##### 6.7.3.5.2.2 OTA Cumulative ACLR test requirement in non-contiguous spectrum or multiple bands {#ota-cumulative-aclr-test-requirement-in-non-contiguous-spectrum-or-multiple-bands .H6}

The following test requirement applies for an AAS BS operating in
non-contiguous spectrum or multiple bands.

The following requirement applies for the gap sizes listed in Table
6.7.3.5.2.2-1:

\- inside a sub-block gap within an operating band for an AAS BS
operating in non-contiguous spectrum;

\- inside an *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* for a multi-band capable AAS BS.

The Cumulative Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (CACLR) in a
sub-block gap or *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* is the ratio of:

a\) the sum of the filtered mean power centred on the assigned channel
frequencies for the two carriers adjacent to each side of the sub-block
gap or *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*; and

b\) the filtered mean power centred on a frequency channel adjacent to
one of the respective sub-block edges or *Base Station RF Bandwidth
edges*.

The assumed filter for the adjacent channel frequency is defined in
Table 6.7.3.5.2.2-1 and the filters on the assigned channels are defined
in Table 6.7.3.5.2.2-2.

The CACLR for UTRA carriers located on either side of the sub-block gap
or *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* shall not be less than the value specified
in Table 6.7.3.5.2.2-1.

Bandwidth gap* sizes listed in Table 6.7.3.5.3.2-1,

\- Inside a sub-block gap within an operating band for a BS operating in
non-contiguous spectrum.

\- Inside an *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* for a multi-band capable AAS BS.

frequencies for the two carriers adjacent to each side of the sub-block
gap or *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*; and

one of the respective sub-block edges or *Base Station RF Bandwidth
edges*.

### 6.7.4 OTA Spectrum emission mask

#### 6.7.4.1 Definition and applicability

This requirement is applicable for AAS BS in *single RAT UTRA operation*
only.

The spectrum emission mask minimum requirements are quoted as TRP unless
otherwise stated.

#### 6.7.4.2 Minimum requirement

For AAS BS in *single RAT UTRA operation* the minimum requirement is
defined in TS 37.105 \[6\], clause 9.7.4.3.

This requirement does not apply to *single RAT E-UTRA operation* or *MSR
operation*.

#### 6.7.4.3 Test purpose

This test measures the emissions of the AAS BS, close to the assigned
channel bandwidth of the wanted signal, while the AAS BS is in
operation.

#### 6.7.4.4 Method of test

##### 6.7.4.4.1 Initial conditions

##### 6.7.4.4.1.1 General test conditions {#general-test-conditions-3 .H6}

Test environment:

\- normal; see annex G.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier:

\- B, M and T; see clause 4.12.1.

*Base Station RF Bandwidth* positions to be tested for multi-carrier:

\- B~RFBW~, M~RFBW~ and T~RFBW~ in single-band operation; see
clause 4.12.1; B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ in multi-band
operation, see clause 4.12.1.

##### 6.7.4.4.1.2 UTRA FDD {#utra-fdd-8 .H6}

For an AAS BS declared to be capable of single carrier operation only,
set to transmit a signal according to TM1, in clause 4.12.2.

For a multi-carrier capable AAS BS, set to transmit according to TM1 on
all carriers configured using the applicable test configuration.

##### 6.7.4.4.2 Procedure

The following procedure for measuring TRP is based on the directional
power measurements as described in in Annex F. An alternative method to
measure TRP is to use a characterized and calibrated reverberation
chamber. If so, follow steps 1, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 10. When calibrated and
operated within the guidance of 3GPP TR 37.941 \[38\] the measurement
methods are applicable and selected depending on availability at the
test facility.

1\) Place the AAS BS at the positioner.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation (see
table 4.10-1, D9.2) of the AAS BS with the test system.

3\) The measurement devices characteristics shall be:

\- a 30 kHz measurement bandwidth.

\- Measurements with an offset from the carrier centre frequency between
2,515 MHz and 4.0 MHz shall use Measurements with an offset from the
carrier centre frequency between 4.0 MHz and (f\_offset~max~ - 500 kHz)
shall use a 1 MHz measurement bandwidth.

\- detection mode: true RMS voltage or true power averaging.

The emission power should be averaged over an appropriate time duration
to ensure the measurement is within the measurement uncertainty in Table
4.1.2.2-1.

As a general rule, the resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment
should be equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to improve
measurement accuracy, sensitivity, efficiency and avoiding e.g. carrier
leakage, the resolution bandwidth may be smaller than the measurement
bandwidth. When the resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement
bandwidth, the result should be integrated over the measurement
bandwidth in order to obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the
measurement bandwidth.

4\) For single carrier operation, set the AAS BS to transmit according
to the applicable test configuration in clause 5 using the corresponding
test model(s) in clause 4.12.2 at manufacturers declared *rated carrier
TRP* (P~rated,c,TRP~).

For an AAS BS declared to be capable of multi-carrier and/or CA
operation use the applicable test signal configuration and corresponding
power setting specified in clause 4.11.

5\) For UTRA FDD *multi-band RIB* or *RIB* operating in non-contiguous
spectrum, the emission within the Inter RF Bandwidth or sub-block gap
shall be measured using the specified measurement bandwidth from the
closest *Base Station RF Bandwidth* or sub block edge.

6\) Orient the positioner (and BS) in order that the direction to be
tested aligns with the test antenna such that measurements to determine
TRP can be performed (see annex F).

7\) Sweep the centre frequency of the measurement filter in contiguous
steps and measure emission power within the specified frequency ranges
with the specified measurement bandwidth.

8\) Repeat step 6-7 for all directions in the appropriated TRP
measurement grid needed for TRP~Estimate~ (see Annex F).

9\) Calculate TRP~Estimate~ using the measurements made in Step 7.

In addition, for *multi-band RIB*, the following steps shall apply:

10\) For *multi-band RIB* and single band tests, repeat the steps above
per involved band where single band test configurations and test models
shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

#### 6.7.4.5 Test Requirement

##### 6.7.4.5.1 UTRA FDD

The measurement result shall not exceed the test requirements specified
in Tables 6.7.4.5.1-1 to 6.7.4.5.1-11 for the appropriate
P~rated,c,TRP~, where

\- ∆f is the separation between the carrier frequency and the nominal
-3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to the carrier frequency.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the carrier frequency and the
centre of the measurement filter;

\- f\_offset~max~ is either 12.5 MHz or the offset to the UMTS Tx band
edge as defined in clause 3.4.1 of TS 25.141 \[10\], whichever is the
greater.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

Inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gaps* with Wgap \< 2×Δf~OBUE~ for a
*multi-band RIB*, emissions shall not exceed the cumulative sum of the
*minimum requirements* specified at the *Base Station RF Bandwidth
edges* on each side of the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*. The *minimum
requirements* for *Base Station RF Bandwidth edge* is specified in the
tables below, where in this case:

\- ∆f is equal to 2.5 MHz plus the separation between the *Base Station
RF Bandwidth edge* frequency and the nominal -3dB point of the measuring
filter closest to the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edge*.

\- f\_offset is equal to 2.5 MHz plus the separation between the *Base
Station RF Bandwidth edge* frequency and the centre of the measuring
filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is either 12.5 MHz or the offset to the UMTS Tx band
edge, whichever is the greater.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

For a *multi-band RIB*, the operating band unwanted emission minimum
requirements apply also in a supported operating band without any
carrier transmitted, in the case where there are carrier(s) transmitted
in another supported operating band. In this case, no cumulative limit
is applied in the *inter-band gap* between a supported *downlink
operating band* with carrier(s) transmitted and a supported *downlink
operating band* without any carrier transmitted and

\- In case the *inter-band gap* between a downlink band with carrier(s)
transmitted and a downlink band without any carrier transmitted is less
than 2×Δf~OBUE~ , f\_offset~max~ shall be the offset to the frequency
Δf~OBUE~ outside the outermost edges of the two *downlink operating
band*s and the operating band unwanted emission limit of the band where
there are carriers transmitted, as defined in the tables of the present
clause, shall apply across both downlink bands.

\- In other cases, the operating band unwanted emission limit of the
band where there are carriers transmitted, as defined in the tables of
the present clause for the largest frequency offset (∆f~max~), shall
apply from Δf~OBUE~ below the lowest frequency, up to Δf~OBUE~ above the
highest frequency of the *downlink operating band* without any carrier
transmitted.

Inside any *sub-block gap* for a RIB operating in *non-contiguous
spectrum*, emissions shall not exceed the cumulative sum of the *minimum
requirements* specified for the adjacent sub blocks on each side of the
*sub-block gap*. The *minimum requirement* for each sub block is
specified in the tables below, where in this case:

\- ∆f is equal to 2.5 MHz plus the separation between the sub block edge
frequency and the nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to
the sub block edge.

\- f\_offset is equal to 2.5 MHz plus the separation between the sub
block edge frequency and the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is equal to the *sub-block gap* bandwidth minus half
of the bandwidth of the measuring filter plus 2.5 MHz.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

### 6.7.5 OTA Operating band unwanted emission

#### 6.7.5.1 Definition and applicability

Unless otherwise stated, for E-UTRA single band and MSR the operating
band unwanted emission limits are defined from Δf~OBUE~ below the lowest
frequency of each supported *downlink operating band* to the lower *Base
Station RF Bandwidth edge* located at F~BW\ RF,low~ and from the upper
*Base Station RF Bandwidth edge* located at F~BW\ RF,high~ up to
Δf~OBUE~ above the highest frequency of each supported *downlink
operating band*.

The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered
and for all transmission modes foreseen by the manufacturer\'s
specification.

For BS operating in bands n50, n51, n74, n75 and n76 additional emission
limits that might be applicable outside OBUE frequency domain are
specified in clause 6.7.5.5.4.6.

#### 6.7.5.2 Minimum Requirement

For AAS BS in *MSR operation* the minimum requirement is defined in
TS 37.105 \[6\], clause 9.7.5.2

For AAS BS in *single RAT E-UTRA* *operation* the minimum requirement is
defined in TS 37.105 \[6\], clause 9.7.5.4.

This requirement does not apply to *single RAT UTRA* *operation*.

#### 6.7.5.3 Test purpose

This test measures the emissions of the AAS BS, close to the assigned
channel bandwidth of the wanted signal, while the AAS BS is in
operation.

#### 6.7.5.4 Method of test

##### 6.7.5.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment:

\- normal; annex G.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier:

\- B, M and T; see clause 4.12.1.

*Base Station RF Bandwidth* positions to be tested for multi-carrier:

\- B~RFBW~, M~RFBW~ and T~RFBW~ in single-band operation; see
clause 4.12.1; B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ in multi-band
operation, see clause 4.12.1

##### 6.7.5.4.2 Procedure

The following procedure for measuring TRP is based on the directional
power measurements as described in Annex F. An alternative method to
measure TRP is to use a characterized and calibrated reverberation
chamber. If so, follow steps 1, 3, 4, 6, 9 and 10. When calibrated and
operated within the guidance of 3GPP TR 37.941 \[38\] the measurement
methods are applicable and selected depending on availability at the
test facility.

1\) Place the AAS BS at the positioner.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation (see
table 4.10-1, D9.2) of the AAS BS with the test system.

3\) The measurement devices characteristics shall be:

\- detection mode: true RMS voltage or true power averaging.

The emission power should be averaged over an appropriate time duration
to ensure the measurement is within the measurement uncertainty in Table
4.1.2.2-1.

4\) Set the AAS BS to transmit:

a\) For MSR:

\- Set the AAS BS to transmit maximum power according to the applicable
test configuration in clause 5 using the corresponding test models or
set of physical channels in clause 4.12.

b\) For E-UTRA:

*-* AAS BS declared to be capable of single carrier operation only, set
the AAS BS to transmit a signal according to E-TM1.1 (clause 4.12.2) at
manufacturer\'s declared *rated carrier TRP* (P~rated,c,TRP~).

\- For an AAS BS declared to be capable of multi-carrier and/or CA
operation, set the set the AAS BS to transmit according to E-TM1.1 on
all carriers configured using the applicable test configuration and
corresponding power setting specified in clause 4.11.

5\) Orient the positioner (and BS) in order that the direction to be
tested aligns with the test antenna such that measurements to determine
TRP can be performed (see annex F).

6\) Sweep the centre frequency of the measurement filter in contiguous
steps and measure emission power within the specified frequency ranges
with the specified measurement bandwidth.

7\) Repeat step 6-7 for all directions in the appropriated TRP
measurement grid needed for TRP~Estimate~ (see annex F).

8\) Calculate TRP~Estimate~ using the measurements made in Step 7.

9\) Repeat the test for the remaining test cases:

a\) For MSR with channel set-up according to clause 5 and clause 4.12.2.

b\) For E-UTRA with the channel set-up according to E-TM 1.2

In addition, for *multi-band RIB*, the following steps shall apply:

10\) For *multi-band RIB* and single band tests, repeat the steps above
per involved band where single band test configurations and test models
shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

#### 6.7.5.5 Test Requirement

##### 6.7.5.5.1 General

As a general rule, the resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment
should be equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to improve
measurement accuracy, sensitivity and efficiency, the resolution
bandwidth can be smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When the
resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the
result should be integrated over the measurement bandwidth in order to
obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.

##### 6.7.5.5.2 MSR Band categories 1 and 3

For an AAS BS of Wide Area BS class operating in Band Category 1 or Band
Category 3, the requirement applies outside the *Base Station RF
Bandwidth edges*. In addition, for a Wide Area BS operating in
non-contiguous spectrum, it applies inside any sub-block gap. In
addition, for an AAS BS of Wide Area BS class operating in multiple
bands, it applies inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*.

For an AAS BS of Medium Range BS class operating in Band Category 1 the
requirement applies outside the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edges*. In
addition, for a Medium Range BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum, it
applies inside any sub-block gap. In addition, for an AAS BS of Medium
Range BS class operating in multiple bands, it applies inside any *Inter
RF Bandwidth gap*.

For an AAS BS of Local Area BS class operating in Band Category 1 the
requirement applies outside the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edges*. In
addition, for a Local Area BS operating in non-contiguous spectrum, it
applies inside any sub-block gap. In addition, for an AAS BS of Local
Area BS class operating in multiple bands, it applies inside any *Inter
RF Bandwidth gap*.

Outside the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edges*, emissions shall not
exceed the maximum levels specified in Tables 6.7.5.5.2-1 to 6.7.5.5.2-8
below, where:

\- ∆f is the separation between the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edge*
frequency and the nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to
the carrier frequency.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the *Base Station RF Bandwidth
edge* frequency and the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is the offset to the frequency Δf~OBUE~ MHz outside
the downlink operating band.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

For a *multi-band RIB*, inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*s with
W~gap~ \< 2×Δf~OBUE~ MHz, emissions shall not exceed the cumulative sum
of the test requirements specified at the *Base Station RF Bandwidth
edges* on each side of the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*. The minimum
requirement for *Base Station RF Bandwidth edge* is specified in Tables
6.7.5.5.2-1 to 6.7.5.5.2-8, where in this case:

\- ∆f is the separation between the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edge*
frequency and the nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to
the carrier frequency.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the *Base Station RF Bandwidth
edge* frequency and the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is equal to the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* divided by
two.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offsetmax minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

For a *multi-band RIB*, the operating band unwanted emission limits
apply also in a supported operating band without any carriers
transmitted, in the case where there are carriers transmitted in another
operating band. In this case where there is no carrier transmitted in an
operating band, no cumulative limits are applied in the *inter-band gap*
between a supported downlink band with carrier(s) transmitted and a
supported downlink band without any carrier transmitted and

\- In case the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* between a supported downlink
band with carrier(s) transmitted and a supported downlink band without
any carrier transmitted is less than 2×Δf~OBUE~ MHz, f\_offset~max~
shall be the offset to the frequency Δf~OBUE~ MHz outside the outermost
edges of the two supported downlink operating bands and the operating
band unwanted emission limit of the band where there are carriers
transmitted, as defined in the tables of the present clause, shall apply
across both supported downlink bands.

\- In other cases, the operating band unwanted emission limit of the
band where there are carriers transmitted, as defined in the tables of
the present clause for the largest frequency offset (∆f~max~), shall
apply from Δf~OBUE~ MHz below the lowest frequency, up to Δf~OBUE~ MHz
above the highest frequency of the supported downlink operating band
without any carrier transmitted.

Inside any sub-block gap for a *RIB* operating in non-contiguous
spectrum, emissions shall not exceed the cumulative sum of the test
requirements specified for the adjacent sub blocks on each side of the
sub block gap. The minimum requirement for each sub block is specified
in Tables 6.7.5.5.2-1 to 6.7.5.5.2-8, where in this case:

\- ∆f is the separation between the sub block edge frequency and the
nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to the sub block
edge frequency.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the sub block edge frequency and
the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is equal to the sub block gap bandwidth divided by
two.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

Applicability of Wide Area operating band unwanted emission requirements
in tables 6.7.5.5.2-1/2, 6.7.5.5.2-2a and 6.7.5.5.2-2b is specified in
table 6.7.5.5.2-0.

Note: Option 1 and Option 2 correspond to the Category B option 1/2
operating band unwanted emissions defined in the E-UTRA and NR
specifications TS 36.104 \[4\] and TS 38.104 \[36\]. Option 2 also
corresponds to the UTRA spectrum emission mask as defined in TS 25.104
\[2\].

##### 6.7.5.5.3 MSR Band Category 2

For a *RIB* operating in Band Category 2 the requirement applies outside
the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edges*. In addition, for a *RIB*
operating in non-contiguous spectrum, it applies inside any sub-block
gap.

Outside the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edges*, emissions shall not
exceed the maximum levels specified in Tables 6.7.5.5.3-1 to
6.7.5.5.3-8, where:

\- ∆f is the separation between the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edge*
frequency and the nominal -3dB point of the measuring filter closest to
the carrier frequency.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the *Base Station RF Bandwidth
edge* frequency and the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is the offset to the frequency Δf~OBUE~ MHz outside
the downlink operating band.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

For a *multi-band RIB*, inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*s with
W~gap~ \< 2×Δf~OBUE~ MHz, emissions shall not exceed the cumulative sum
of the test requirements specified at the *Base Station RF Bandwidth
edges* on each side of the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*. The *minimum
requirement* for *Base Station RF Bandwidth edge* is specified in Tables
6.7.5.5.3-1 to 6.7.5.5.3-8, where in this case:

\- ∆f is the separation between the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edge*
frequency and the nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to
the carrier frequency.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the *Base Station RF Bandwidth
edge* frequency and the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is equal to the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* divided by
two.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offsetmax minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

For a *multi-band RIB* and where there is no carrier transmitted in an
operating band, no cumulative limits are applied in the *inter-band gap*
between a supported downlink band with carrier(s) transmitted and a
supported downlink band without any carrier transmitted and

\- In case the *inter-band gap* between a supported downlink band with
carrier(s) transmitted and a supported downlink band without any carrier
transmitted less than is 2×Δf~OBUE~ MHz, f\_offset~max~ shall be the
offset to the frequency Δf~OBUE~ MHz outside the outermost edges of the
two supported downlink operating bands and the operating band unwanted
emission limit of the band where there are carriers transmitted, as
defined in the tables of the present clause, shall apply across both
supported downlink bands.

\- In other cases, the operating band unwanted emission limit of the
band where there are carriers transmitted, as defined in the tables of
the present clause for the largest frequency offset (∆f~max~), shall
apply from Δf~OBUE~ MHz below the lowest frequency, up to Δf~OBUE~ MHz
above the highest frequency of the supported downlink operating band
without any carrier transmitted.

Inside any sub-block gap for a *RIB* operating in non-contiguous
spectrum, emissions shall not exceed the cumulative sum of the test
requirement specified for the adjacent sub blocks on each side of the
sub block gap. The *minimum requirement* for each sub block is specified
in Tables 6.7.5.5.3-1 to 6.7.5.5.3-8, where in this case:

\- ∆f is the separation between the sub block edge frequency and the
nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to the sub block
edge.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the sub block edge frequency and
the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is equal to the sub block gap bandwidth divided by
two.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

Applicability of Wide Area operating band unwanted emission requirements
in tables 6.7.5.5.3-1, 6.7.5.5.3-2a and 6.7.5.5.3-2b is specified in
table 6.7.5.5.3-0.

Note: Option 1 and Option 2 correspond to the Category B option 1/2
operating band unwanted emissions defined in the E-UTRA and NR
specifications TS 36.104 \[4\] and TS 38.104 \[36\]. Option 2 also
corresponds to the UTRA spectrum emission mask as defined in TS 25.104
\[2\].

NOTE 9: As a general rule for the requirements in the present clause,
the resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment should be equal to
the measurement bandwidth. However, to improve measurement accuracy,
sensitivity and efficiency, the resolution bandwidth may be smaller than
the measurement bandwidth. When the resolution bandwidth is smaller than
the measurement bandwidth, the result should be integrated over the
measurement bandwidth in order to obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth
of the measurement bandwidth.

##### 6.7.5.5.4 MSR Additional requirements

##### 6.7.5.5.4.1 Limits in FCC Title 47 {#limits-in-fcc-title-47 .H6}

In addition to the requirements in clauses 6.7.5.5.2 and 6.7.5.5.3, the
AAS BSW may have to comply with the applicable emission limits
established by FCC Title 47 \[18\], when deployed in regions where those
limits are applied, and under the conditions declared by the
manufacturer.

##### 6.7.5.5.4.2 Unsynchronized operation for BC3 {#unsynchronized-operation-for-bc3 .H6}

In certain regions, the following requirements may apply to a TDD AAS BS
operating in BC3 in the same geographic area and in the same operating
band as another TDD system without synchronisation. For this case the
emissions shall not exceed -52 dBm/MHz in each supported downlink
operating band except in:

\- The frequency range from 10 MHz below the lower *Base Station RF
Bandwidth edge* to the frequency 10 MHz above the upper *Base Station RF
Bandwidth edge* of each supported band.

NOTE 1: Local or regional regulations may specify another excluded
frequency range, which may include frequencies where synchronised TDD
systems operate.

NOTE 2: TDD Base Stations that are synchronized and operating in BC3 can
transmit without these additional co-existence requirements.

##### 6.7.5.5.4.3 Protection of DTT {#protection-of-dtt .H6}

In certain regions the following requirement may apply for protection of
DTT. For an AAS BS operating in Band 20/n20, the level of emissions in
the band 470-790 MHz, measured in an 8 MHz filter bandwidth on centre
frequencies F~filter~ according to table 6.7.5.5.4.3-1, shall not exceed
the maximum emission level TRP level shown in the table. This
requirement applies in the frequency range 470-790 MHz even though part
of the range falls in the spurious domain.

##### 6.7.5.5.4.4 Co-existence with RNSS/GPS services in North America {#co-existence-with-rnssgps-services-in-north-america .H6}

In regions where FCC regulation applies, requirements for protection of
GPS according to FCC Order DA 20-48applies for operation in Band 24. The
following normative requirement covers the base station, to be used
together with other information about the site installation to verify
compliance with the requirement in FCC Order DA 20-48. The requirement
applies to BS operating in Band 24 to ensure that appropriate
interference protection is provided to the GPS. This requirement applies
in the frequency range 1541-1650 MHz even though part of the range falls
in the spurious domain.

The level of emissions in the 1541 - 1650 MHz band, measured in
measurement bandwidth according to table 6.7.5.5.4.4-1 shall not exceed
the maximum TRP limits indicated in the table.

NOTE: The regional requirement, included in FCC Order DA 20-48 is
defined in terms of EIRP (effective isotropic radiated power), which is
dependent on both the BS emissions at the antenna connector and the
deployment (including antenna gain and feeder loss). The method outlined
in TS 37.105 \[6\] annex B1 indicates how the limit in table
6.7.5.5.4.4-1 demonstrates compliance to the regional requirement in DA
20-48. P~EIRP~ values in table 6.7.5.5.4.4-1 are the effective isotropic
power (or radiated power spectral density) set in the FCC Order DA 20-48
for the specified frequency ranges and bandwidths.

##### 6.7.5.5.5.1 General {#general-27 .H6}

The measurement results in clause 6.7.5.4 shall not exceed the maximum
levels specified in the tables below, where:

\- ∆f is the separation between the channel edge frequency and the
nominal -3dB point of the measuring filter closest to the carrier
frequency.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the channel edge frequency and
the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is the offset to the frequency Δf~OBUE~ MHz outside
the downlink operating band.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

For a *multi-band RIB*, inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*s with
W~gap~ \< 2×Δf~OBUE~ MHz, emissions shall not exceed the cumulative sum
of the test requirements specified at the *Base Station RF Bandwidth
edges* on each side of the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*. The test
requirement for *Base Station RF Bandwidth edge* is specified in Tables
6.7.5.5.5.2-1 to 6.7.5.5.5.2‑9, where in this case:

\- ∆f is the separation between the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edge*
frequency and the nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to
the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edge*.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the *Base Station RF Bandwidth
edge* frequency and the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is equal to the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* minus half of
the bandwidth of the measuring filter.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

For *multi-band RIB*, the operating band unwanted emission limits apply
also in a supported operating band without any carrier transmitted, in
the case where there are carrier(s) transmitted in another supported
operating band. In this case, no cumulative limit is applied in the
*inter-band gap* between a supported downlink operating band with
carrier(s) transmitted and a supported downlink operating band without
any carrier transmitted and:

\- In case the *inter-band gap* between a supported downlink operating
band with carrier(s) transmitted and a supported downlink operating band
without any carrier transmitted is less than 2×Δf~OBUE~ MHz,
f\_offset~max~ shall be the offset to the frequency Δf~OBUE~ MHz outside
the outermost edges of the two supported downlink operating bands and
the operating band unwanted emission limit of the band where there are
carriers transmitted, as defined in the tables of the present clause,
shall apply across both downlink bands.

\- In other cases, the operating band unwanted emission limit of the
band where there are carriers transmitted, as defined in the tables of
the present clause for the largest frequency offset (∆f~max~), shall
apply from Δf~OBUE~ MHz below the lowest frequency, up to Δf~OBUE~ MHz
above the highest frequency of the supported downlink operating band
without any carrier transmitted.

For a multicarrier E-UTRA TAB connector or a RIB configured for
intra-band contiguous or non-contiguous carrier aggregation the
definitions above apply to the lower edge of the carrier transmitted at
the lowest carrier frequency and the upper edge of the carrier
transmitted at the highest carrier frequency within a specified
frequency band.

In addition inside any sub-block gap for a *RIB* operating in
non-contiguous spectrum, measurement results shall not exceed the
cumulative sum of the test requirements specified for the adjacent sub
blocks on each side of the sub block gap. The minimum requirement for
each sub block is specified in Tables 6.7.5.5.5.2-1 to 6.7.5.5.5.2-9,
where in this case:

\- ∆f is the separation between the sub block edge frequency and the
nominal -3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to the sub block
edge.

\- f\_offset is the separation between the sub block edge frequency and
the centre of the measuring filter.

\- f\_offset~max~ is equal to the sub block gap bandwidth minus half of
the bandwidth of the measuring filter.

\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f\_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

##### 6.7.5.5.5.4 Wide Area BS Category B (Option 2) {#wide-area-bs-category-b-option-2 .H6}

For Category B Operating band unwanted emissions, there are two options
for the limits that may be applied regionally, option 2 is as follows.

The limits in this clause are intended for Europe and may be applied
regionally for a *RIB* operating in band 1, 3, 8, 32, 33, 34 or 65.

For a *RIB* operating in band 1, 3, 8, 32, 33, 34 or 65, emissions shall
not exceed the maximum levels specified in table 6.6.5.5.5.4-1 below for
5, 10, 15 and 20 MHz channel bandwidth.

In certain regions, the following test requirements may apply to an
E-UTRA TDD *RIB* operating in the same geographic area and in the same
operating band as another E-UTRA TDD system without synchronisation. For
this case the emissions shall not exceed -52 dBm/MHz in each supported
downlink operating band, except in:

\- The frequency range from Δf~OBUE~ MHz below the lower channel edge to
the frequency Δf~OBUE~ MHz above the upper channel edge of each
supported band.

In certain regions the following test requirement may apply for
protection of DTT. For E-UTRA a *RIB* operating in Band 20, the level of
emissions in the band 470-790 MHz, measured in an 8 MHz filter bandwidth
on centre frequencies F~filter~ according to Table 6.7.5.5.5.7-4, shall
not exceed the maximum emission TRP level shown in the table. This test
requirement applies in the frequency range 470-790 MHz even though part
of the range falls in the spurious domain.

NOTE 1: The regional requirement is defined in terms of EIRP (effective
isotropic radiated power), which is dependent on both the BS emissions
and the deployment (including antenna gain and feeder loss). The method
outlined in annex B1, TS 37.105 \[6\] indicates how the limit in Table
6.7.5.5.5.7-4 demonstrates compliance to the regional requirement.

In regions where FCC regulation applies, requirements for protection of
GPS according to FCC Order DA 20-48applies for operation in Band 24. The
following normative requirement covers the base station, to be used
together with other information about the site installation to verify
compliance with the requirement in FCC Order DA 20-48. The requirement
applies to BS operating in Band 24 to ensure that appropriate
interference protection is provided to the GPS. This requirement applies
in the frequency range 1541-1650 MHz even though part of the range falls
in the spurious domain.

The level of emissions in the 1541 - 1650 MHz band, measured in
measurement bandwidth according to table 6.7.5.5.5.7-5 shall not exceed
the maximum TRP limits indicated in the table.

NOTE: The regional requirements, included in FCC Order DA 20-48 are
defined in terms of EIRP (effective isotropic radiated power), which is
dependent on both the BS emissions at the antenna connector and the
deployment (including antenna gain and feeder loss). The method outlined
in TS 37.105 \[6\], Annex B1 indicates how the limit in table
6.7.5.5.5.7-5 demonstrates compliance to the regional requirement in DA
20-48. P~EIRP~ values in table 6.7.5.5.5.7-5 are the effective isotropic
power (or radiated power spectral density) set in the FCC Order DA 20-48
for the specified frequency ranges and bandwidths.

### 6.7.6 OTA Spurious emission

#### 6.7.6.1 General

The OTA spurious emissions limits are specified as TRP per cell unless
otherwise specified.

The OTA transmitter spurious emission limits apply from 30 MHz to
12.75 GHz, excluding the following RAT-specific frequency ranges:

\- UTRA FDD BS as specified in TS 25.104 \[2\]: from 12.5 MHz below the
lowest carrier frequency used up to 12.5 MHz above the highest carrier
frequency used.

\- E-UTRA BS as specified in TS 36.104 \[4\]: from Δf~OBUE~ below the
lowest frequency of the *downlink operating band* up to Δf~OBUE~ above
the highest frequency of the *downlink operating band*, where Δf~OBUE~
is defined in clause 6.7.1.

\- MSR BS as specified in TS 37.104 \[5\]: from Δf~OBUE~ below the
lowest frequency of the *downlink operating band* up to Δf~OBUE~ above
the highest frequency of the *downlink operating band*, where Δf~OBUE~
is defined in clause 6.7.1. For some operating bands the upper frequency
limit is higher than 12.75 GHz in order to comply with the 5^th^
harmonic limit of the *downlink operating band*, as specified in ITU-R
recommendation SM.329 \[16\]. In some exceptional cases, requirements
apply also closer than 10 MHz from the *downlink operating band*; these
cases are highlighted in the requirement tables in respective referenced
UTRA, E-UTRA, NR or MSR specifications. For operating bands supported by
*multi-band RIB* each supported band including the Δf~OBUE~ around the
band are excluded from the spurious emissions requirements.

The requirements apply for both *single band* *RIBs* and *multi-band*
*RIBs* (except for frequencies at which exclusion bands or other
multi-band provisions apply) and for all transmission modes foreseen by
the manufacturer\'s specification. Unless otherwise stated, all
requirements are measured as mean power.

For operation in Region 2, where the FCC guidance for MIMO systems
in \[17\] is applicable, the emissions limits are the same regardless of
the number of transceiver units so the limits are equivalent to those
for a single transceiver unit as specified in the *as the corresponding
applicable non-AAS BS per transmitter requirement specified in*
TS 25.104 \[2\], TS 25.105 \[3\], TS 36.104 \[4\], TS 37.104 \[5\] or
TS 38.104 \[33\]. For E-UTRA and NR the limits will be 9dB lower and for
UTRA FDD the limits will be 6dB lower, unless stated differently in
regional regulation.

The AAS BS requirements for spurious emissions limits which are
specified for Band 46 in TS 37.104 \[5\], are applicable for AAS BS.

For BS operating in bands n50, n51, n74, n75 and n76 additional emission
limits that might be applicable in the spurious emissions frequency
domain are specified in clause 6.7.5.5.4.6.

#### 6.7.6.2 Mandatory Requirements

##### 6.7.6.2.1 Definition and applicability

The OTA spurious emissions mandatory requirements include the CAT A, CAT
B and additional minimum requirements for BC2, limits are specified as
TRP per cell unless otherwise specified.

##### 6.7.6.2.2 Minimum Requirement

For AAS BS in *MSR operation* the minimum requirement is defined in
TS 37.105 \[6\], clause 9.7.6.2.1.

For AAS BS in *single RAT UTRA operation* the minimum requirement is
defined in TS 37.105 \[6\], clause 9.7.6.3.1.

For AAS BS in *single RAT E-UTRA operation* the minimum requirement is
defined in TS 37.105 \[6\], clause 9.7.6.4.1.

##### 6.7.6.2.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify the radiated spurious emissions from the
AAS BS at the RIB are within the specified minimum requirements.

##### 6.7.6.2.4 Method of test

##### 6.7.6.2.4.1 Initial conditions {#initial-conditions-16 .H6}

Directions to be tested

As the requirement is TRP the beam pattern(s) may be set up to optimise
the TRP measurement procedure (see annex F).

##### 6.7.6.2.4.2 Procedure {#procedure-16 .H6}

The following procedure for measuring TRP is based on the directional
power measurements as described in in Annex F. An alternative method to
measure TRP is to use a characterized and calibrated reverberation
chamber. If so, follow steps 1, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 10. When calibrated and
operated within the guidance of 3GPP TR 37.941 \[38\] the measurement
methods are applicable and selected depending on availability at the
test facility.

1\) Place the AAS BS at the positioner.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation (see
table 4.10-1, D9.2) of the AAS BS with the test system.

3\) Measurements shall use a measurement bandwidth in accordance to the
conditions in clause 6.7.6.2.5.

4\) The measurement device characteristics shall be:

\- Detection mode: True RMS.

The emission power should be averaged over an appropriate time duration
to ensure the measurement is within the measurement uncertainty in Table
4.1.2.2-1.

5\) Set the AAS BS to transmit

a\) For MSR:

\- Set the RIB to transmit maximum power according to the applicable
test configuration in clause 5 using the corresponding test models or
set of physical channels in clause 4.11.

b\) For UTRA:

\- For a RIB declared to be capable of single carrier operation only,
set the RIB to transmit a signal according to TM1, clause 4.12.2, at the
manufacturer\'s declared rated carrier TRP, P~rated,c,TRP~.

\- For a RIB declared to be capable of multi-carrier operation, set the
set the RIB to transmit according to TM1 on all carriers configured
using the applicable test configuration and corresponding power setting
specified in clause 4.11.

c\) For E-UTRA:

*-* RIB declared to be capable of single carrier operation only, set the
RIB to transmit a signal according to E-TM1.1 in clause 4.12.2, at
manufacturer\'s declared rated carrier TRP, P~rated,c,TRP~.

\- For a RIB declared to be capable of multi-carrier and/or CA
operation, set the set the RIB to transmit according to E-TM1.1 on all
carriers configured using the applicable test configuration and
corresponding power setting specified in clause 4.11.

6\) Orient the positioner (and BS) in order that the direction to be
tested aligns with the test antenna such that measurements to determine
TRP can be performed (see annex F).

7\) Measure the emission at the specified frequencies with specified
measurement bandwidth

8\) Repeat step 6-7 for all directions in the appropriated TRP
measurement grid needed for full TRP estimation (see annex F).

NOTE 1: The TRP measurement grid may not be the same for all measurement
frequencies.

NOTE 2: The frequency sweep or the TRP measurement grid sweep may be
done in any order

9\) Calculate TRP at each specified frequency using the directional
measurements.

In addition, for *multi-band RIB(s)*, the following steps shall apply:

10\) For *multi-band RIBs* and single band tests, repeat the steps above
per involved band where single band test configurations and test models
shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

#### 6.7.6.3 Protection of the BS receiver of own or different BS

##### 6.7.6.3.1 Definition and applicability

This requirement shall be applied for FDD operation in order to prevent
the receivers of own or a different BS of the same band being
desensitised by emissions from a *OTA AAS BS*.

The requirement is a co-location requirement, the power levels specified
at the CLTA output(s).

##### 6.7.6.3.2 Minimum Requirement

The minimum requirement for AAS BS in *MSR operation* is defined in
TS 37.105 \[6\], clause 9.7.6.2.

The minimum requirement for AAS BS in *single RAT UTRA operation* is
defined in TS 37.105 \[6\], clause 9.7.6.3.

The minimum requirement for AAS BS in *single RAT E-UTRA operation* is
defined in TS 37.105 \[6\], clause 9.7.6.4.

##### 6.7.6.3.3 Test purpose

The test purpose of OTA spurious emission is to verify the radiated
spurious emissions from the AAS BS at the *RIB* are within specified
requirements.

For OTA co-locate spurious emission, the test purpose is to verify that
the emission is within the specified requirement limits at the CLTA
conducted output(s).

##### 6.7.6.3.4 Method of test

##### 6.7.6.3.4.1 Initial conditions {#initial-conditions-17 .H6}

Test environment:

\- normal; see annex G.2.

the highest operating band may be omitted.

\- For B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~, co-location spurious emission testing below
the lowest operating band may be omitted.

Directions to be tested:

\- The requirement is specified as co-location requirement. For general
description of co-location requirements, refer to clause 4.12.

The co-location spurious emission is measured at the CLTA conducted
output(s).

##### 6.7.6.3.4.2 Procedure {#procedure-17 .H6}

1\) Select a CLTA according to parameters given in Table 4.15.2.2-1 and
place the CLTA according to parameters given in Table 4.15.2.3-1.

2\) Several CLTAs are required to cover the whole co-location spurious
emission frequency ranges.

3\) The test antenna shall be dual (or single) polarized with the same
frequency range as the *AAS BS* for co-location spurious emission test
case.

4\) Connect test antenna and CLTA to the measurement equipment as
depicted in Annex D1.4.

5\) OTA co-location spurious emission is measured at the CLTA conducted
output(s).

6\) The measurement device (signal analyzer) characteristics shall be:

\- Detection mode: True RMS.

The emission power should be averaged over an appropriate time duration
to ensure the measurement is within the measurement uncertainty in Table
4.1.2.2-1.

7\) Set the *AAS BS* to transmit:

a\) For MSR:

\- Set the *AAS BS* to transmit maximum power, according to the
applicable test configuration in clause 5 using the corresponding test
models or set of physical channels in clause 4.11.

b\) For UTRA FDD:

\- For a *AAS BS* declared to be capable of single carrier operation
only, set the *AAS BS* to transmit full maximum power according to TM1,
clause 4.12.2, at the manufacturer\'s declared rated carrier TRP,
P~rated,c,TRP.~

\- For a *AAS BS* declared to be capable of multi-carrier operation, set
the *AAS BS* to transmit maximum power according to TM1 on all carriers
configured using the applicable test configuration and corresponding
power setting specified in clause 4.11.

c\) For E-UTRA:

*-* For *AAS BS* declared to be capable of single carrier operation
only, set the *AAS BS* to transmit maximum power according to E-TM1.1 in
clause 4.12.2, at manufacturer\'s declared rated carrier TRP,
P~rated,c,TRP~.

\- For a *AAS BS* declared to be capable of multi-carrier and/or CA
operation, set the *AAS BS* to transmit maximum power according to
E-TM1.1 on all carriers configured using the applicable test
configuration and corresponding power setting specified in clause 4.11.

8\) Measure the emission at the specified frequencies with specified
measurement bandwidth and note that the measured value does not exceed
the test requirement in clause 6.7.6.5.

NOTE: An alternative measurement method to be used for measuring the OTA
emission is described in Annex H.

In addition, for *multi-band RIB*, the following steps shall apply:

9\) For *multi-band RIB* and single band tests, repeat the steps above
per involved band where single band test configurations and test models
shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

##### 6.7.6.3.5 Test Requirement

#### 6.7.6.4 Additional spurious emissions requirements

##### 6.7.6.4.1 Definition and applicability

These requirements may be applied for the protection of system operating
in frequency ranges other than the BS *downlink operating band*. The
limits may apply as an optional protection of such systems that are
deployed in the same geographical area as the BS, or they may be set by
local or regional regulation as a mandatory requirement for an operating
band. It is in some cases not stated in the present document whether a
requirement is mandatory or under what exact circumstances that a limit
applies, since this is set by local or regional regulation. An overview
of regional requirements in the present document is given in clause 4.5.

Some requirements may apply for the protection of specific equipment
(UE, MS and/or BS) or equipment operating in specific systems (GSM/EDGE,
CDMA, UTRA, E-UTRA, NR etc.) as listed below.

All additional spurious requirements are TRP unless otherwise stated.

##### 6.7.6.4.2 Minimum Requirement

For AAS BS in *MSR operation* the minimum requirement is defined in
TS 37.105 \[6\], clause 9.7.6.2.3.

For AAS BS in *single RAT UTRA operation* the minimum requirement is
defined in TS 37.105 \[6\], clause 9.7.6.3.3.

For AAS BS in *single RAT E-UTRA operation* the minimum requirement is
defined in TS 37.105 \[6\], clause 9.7.6.4.3.

##### 6.7.6.4.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify the radiated spurious emissions from the
AAS BS at the RIB are within the specified additional spurious emissions
requirements.

##### 6.7.6.4.4 Method of test

##### 6.7.6.4.4.1 Initial conditions {#initial-conditions-18 .H6}

Test environment: normal, see annex G.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier:

B when testing from 30 MHz to F~DL\_low~ - Δf~OBUE~

T when testing from F~DL\_high~ + Δf~OBUE~ to 12.75 GHz (or to 5^th^
harmonic)

RF bandwidth positions to be tested: in single-band operation, see
clause 4.12.1.

F~DL\_Blow\_high~ + Δf~OBUE~ to F~DL\_Bhigh\_low~ - Δf~OBUE~

Directions to be tested:

As the requirement is TRP the beam pattern(s) may be set up to optimise
the TRP measurement procedure (see annex F).

##### 6.7.6.4.4.2 Procedure {#procedure-18 .H6}

The following procedure for measuring TRP is based on the directional
power measurements as described in in Annex F. An alternative method to
measure TRP is to use a characterized and calibrated reverberation
chamber. If so, follow steps 1, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 10. When calibrated and
operated within the guidance of 3GPP TR 37.941 \[38\] the measurement
methods are applicable and selected depending on availability at the
test facility.

1\) Place the AAS BS at the positioner.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation (see
table 4.10-1, D9.2) of the AAS BS with the test system.

3\) Measurements shall use a measurement bandwidth in accordance to the
conditions in TS 37.104 \[5\] clause 6.6.1.

4\) The measurement device characteristics shall be:

\- Detection mode: True RMS.

The emission power should be averaged over an appropriate time duration
to ensure the measurement is within the measurement uncertainty in Table
4.1.2.2-1.

5\) Set the AAS BS to transmit

a\) For MSR:

\- Set the RIB to transmit maximum power according to the applicable
test configuration in clause 5 using the corresponding test models or
set of physical channels in clause 4.11.

b\) For UTRA:

\- For a RIB declared to be capable of single carrier operation only,
set the RIB to transmit a signal according to TM1, clause 4.12.2, at the
manufacturer\'s declared rated carrier TRP, P~rated,c,TRP~.

\- For a RIB declared to be capable of multi-carrier operation, set the
set the RIB to transmit according to TM1 on all carriers configured
using the applicable test configuration and corresponding power setting
specified in clause 4.11.

c\) For E-UTRA:

*-* RIB declared to be capable of single carrier operation only, set the
RIB to transmit a signal according to E-TM1.1 in clause 4.12.2, at
manufacturer\'s declared rated carrier TRP P~rated,c,TRP~.

\- For a RIB declared to be capable of multi-carrier and/or CA
operation, set the set the RIB to transmit according to E-TM1.1 on all
carriers configured using the applicable test configuration and
corresponding power setting specified in clause 4.11.

6\) Orient the positioner (and BS) in order that the direction to be
tested aligns with the test antenna such that measurements to determine
TRP can be performed (see annex F).

7\) Measure the emission at the specified frequencies with specified
measurement bandwidth

8\) Repeat step 6-7 for all directions in the appropriated TRP
measurement grid needed for full TRP estimation (see annex F).

Note 1: the TRP measurement grid may not be the same for all measurement
frequencies.

Note 2: the frequency sweep or the TRP measurement grid sweep may be
done in any order

9\) Calculate TRP at each specified frequency using the directional
measurements.

In addition, for *multi-band RIB(s)*, the following steps shall apply:

10\) For *multi-band RIBs* and single band tests, repeat the steps above
per involved band where single band test configurations and test models
shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

##### 6.7.6.4.5 Test Requirement

##### 6.7.6.4.5.1 MSR operation {#msr-operation-2 .H6}

For UTRA, the minimum requirement is specified in clause 6.7.6.4.5.2

For E-UTRA, the minimum requirement is specified in clause 6.7.6.4.5.3.

##### 6.7.6.4.5.1.1 E-UTRA and NR MSR operation {#e-utra-and-nr-msr-operation .H6}

The TRP of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits of table
6.7.6.4.5.1.1-1 for an AAS BS where requirements for co-existence with
the system listed in the first column apply. For a *multi-band RIB*, the
exclusions and conditions in the notes column of table 6.7.6.4.5.1.1-1
apply for each supported operating band.

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause,
except for the cases where the noted requirements apply to a BS
operating in Band 25/n25, Band 27, Band 28/n28 or Band 29, the
co-existence requirements in table 6.7.6.4.5.1.1-1 do not apply for the
Δf~OBUE~ frequency range immediately outside the *downlink operating
band* (see clause 6.7.1). Emission limits for this excluded frequency
range may be covered by local or regional requirements.

NOTE 2: Table 6.7.6.4.5.1.1-1 assumes that two operating bands, where
the frequency ranges in clause 4.7 would be overlapping, are not
deployed in the same geographical area. For such a case of operation
with overlapping frequency arrangements in the same geographical area,
special co-existence requirements may apply that are not covered by the
3GPP specifications.

NOTE 3: For the protection of DCS1800, UTRA Band III or E-UTRA Band 3 or
NR band n3 in China, the frequency ranges of the downlink and uplink
protection requirements are 1805 -- 1850 MHz and 1710 -- 1755 MHz
respectively.

NOTE 4: TDD base stations deployed in the same geographical area, that
are synchronized and use the same or adjacent operating bands can
transmit without additional co-existence requirements. For
unsynchronized base stations (except in Band 46), special co-existence
requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.

NOTE 6: For Band 28/n28 BS, specific solutions may be required to fulfil

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause,
except for the cases where the noted requirements apply to a BS
operating in Band 25, Band 27, Band 28 or Band 29, the co-existence
requirements in table 6.7.6.4.5.3-1 do not apply for the Δf~OBUE~
frequency range immediately outside the *downlink operating band* (see
clause 6.7.1). Emission limits for this excluded frequency range may be
covered by local or regional requirements.

NOTE 2: Table 6.7.6.4.5.3-1 assumes that two operating bands, where the
frequency ranges in clause 4.7 would be overlapping, are not deployed in
the same geographical area. For such a case of operation with
overlapping frequency arrangements in the same geographical area,
special co-existence requirements may apply that are not covered by the
3GPP specifications.

NOTE 3: For the protection of DCS1800, UTRA Band III or E-UTRA Band 3 in
China, the frequency ranges of the downlink and uplink protection
requirements are 1805 -- 1850 MHz and 1710 -- 1755 MHz respectively.

NOTE 4: TDD base stations deployed in the same geographical area, that
are synchronized and use the same or adjacent operating bands can
transmit without additional co-existence requirements. For
unsynchronized base stations (except in Band 46), special co-existence
requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.

NOTE 6: For Band 28 BS, specific solutions may be required to fulfil the
spurious emissions limits for BS for co-existence with Band 27 UL
operating band.

NOTE 7: For Band 29 BS, specific solutions may be required to fulfil the
spurious emissions limits for BS for co-existence with UTRA Band XII or
E-UTRA Band 12 UL operating band, E-UTRA Band 17 UL operating band or
E-UTRA Band 85 UL operating band.

The following requirement may be applied for the protection of PHS. This
requirement is also applicable at specified frequencies falling between
Δf~OBUE~ below the lowest BS transmitter frequency of the *downlink
operating band* and Δf~OBUE~ above the highest BS transmitter frequency
of the *downlink operating band*.

limits of table 6.7.6.5.5.1-1 for a AAS BS where requirements for
co-location with a BS type listed in the first column apply, depending
on the declared Base Station class. For a *multi-band RIB*, the
exclusions and conditions in the notes column of table 6.7.6.5.5.1-1
apply for each supported operating band.

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause,
the co-location requirements in table 6.7.6.5.3.5-1 do not apply for the
Δf~OBUE~ frequency range immediately outside the BS transmit frequency
range of a *downlink operating band* (see clause 6.7.1). The current
state-of-the-art technology does not allow a single generic solution for
co-location with other system on adjacent frequencies for 30 dB BS-BS
minimum coupling loss. However, there are certain site-engineering
solutions that can be used. These techniques are addressed in
TR 25.942 \[31\].

NOTE 2: Table 6.7.6.5.3.5-1 assumes that two operating bands, where the
corresponding BS transmit and receive frequency ranges in clause 4.6
would be overlapping, are not deployed in the same geographical area.
For such a case of operation with overlapping frequency arrangements in
the same geographical area, special co-location requirements may apply
that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.

NOTE 3: Co-located TDD base stations that are synchronized and using the
same or adjacent operating band can transmit without special
co-locations requirements. For unsynchronized base stations, special
co-location requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP
specifications.

##### 6.7.6.5.5.2 Single RAT UTRA operation {#single-rat-utra-operation-3 .H6}

These requirements may be applied for the protection of other BS
receivers when GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850, CDMA850, UTRA FDD, UTRA
TDD and/or E-UTRA BS are co-located with a BS.

The requirements assume with base stations of the same class.

NOTE: For co-location with UTRA, the requirements are based on
co-location with UTRA FDD or TDD base stations.

The requirements are co-location emission requirements and specified as
the power sum of the supported polarization(s) at the CLTA conducted
output(s).

The power sum of any spurious emission is specified over all supported
polarizations at the conducted output(s) of the CLTA and shall not
exceed the limits of table 6.7.6.5.5.2-1 for a AAS BS where requirements
for co-location with a BS type listed in the first column apply,
depending on the declared Base Station class. For a *multi-band RIB*,
the exclusions and conditions in the Notes column of table 6.7.6.5.5.2-1
apply for each supported operating band.

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause,
the co-location requirements in table 6.7.6.5.2.5-1 do not apply for the
10 MHz frequency range immediately outside the BS transmit frequency
range of a *downlink operating band* (see clause 6.7.1). The current
state-of-the-art technology does not allow a single generic solution for
co-location with other system on adjacent frequencies for 30 dB BS-BS
minimum coupling loss. However, there are certain site-engineering
solutions that can be used. These techniques are addressed in
TR 25.942 \[31\].

NOTE 2: Table 6.7.6.5.2.5-1 assumes that two operating bands, where the
corresponding BS transmit and receive frequency ranges in clause 4.6
would be overlapping, are not deployed in the same geographical area.
For such a case of operation with overlapping frequency arrangements in
the same geographical area, special co-location requirements may apply
that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.

NOTE 3: Co-located TDD base stations that are synchronized and using the
same or adjacent operating band can transmit without special
co-locations requirements. For unsynchronized base stations, special
co-location requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP
specifications.

##### 6.7.6.5.5.3 Single RAT E-UTRA operation {#single-rat-e-utra-operation-3 .H6}

These requirements may be applied for the protection of other BS
receivers when GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850, CDMA850, UTRA FDD, UTRA
TDD and/or E-UTRA BS are co-located with a BS.

The requirements assume co-location with base stations of the same
class.

NOTE: For co-location with UTRA, the requirements are based on
co-location with UTRA FDD or TDD base stations.

The requirements are co-location emission requirements and specified as
the power sum of the supported polarization(s) at the CLTA conducted
output(s).

The power sum of any spurious emission is specified over all supported
polarizations at the conducted output(s) of the CLTA and shall not
exceed the limits of table 6.7.6.5.5.3-1 for a AAS BS where requirements
for co-location with a BS type listed in the first column apply,
depending on the declared Base Station class. For a *multi-band RIB*,
the exclusions and conditions in the notes column of table 6.7.6.5.5.3-1
apply for each supported operating band.

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause,
the co-location requirements in table 6.7.6.5.3.5-1 do not apply for the
Δf~OBUE~ frequency range immediately outside the BS transmit frequency
range of a *downlink operating band* (see clause 6.7.1). The current
state-of-the-art technology does not allow a single generic solution for
co-location with other system on adjacent frequencies for 30 dB BS-BS
minimum coupling loss. However, there are certain site-engineering
solutions that can be used. These techniques are addressed in
TR 25.942 \[31\].

NOTE 2: Table 6.7.6.5.3.5-1 assumes that two operating bands, where the
corresponding BS transmit and receive frequency ranges in clause 4.6
would be overlapping, are not deployed in the same geographical area.
For such a case of operation with overlapping frequency arrangements in
the same geographical area, special co-location requirements may apply
that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.

NOTE 3: Co-located TDD base stations that are synchronized and using the
same or adjacent operating band can transmit without special
co-locations requirements. For unsynchronized base stations, special
co-location requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP
specifications.

6.8 OTA Transmitter intermodulation
-----------------------------------

### 6.8.1 Definition and applicability

The OTA transmitter intermodulation requirement is a measure of the
capability of the transmitter unit to inhibit the generation of signals
in its non-linear elements caused by presence of the wanted signal and
an interfering signal reaching the transmitter unit via the RDN and
antenna array from a co-located base station. The requirement applies
during the *transmitter ON period* and the *transmitter transient
period*.

The requirement applies at each RIB supporting transmission in the
operating band.

The transmitter intermodulation level is the *total radiated power* of
the intermodulation products when an interfering signal is injected into
the CLTA.

For *OTA* *AAS BS*, the transmitter intermodulation requirement is
captured by the co-location transmitter intermodulation scenario case,
in which the interfering signal is injected into the CLTA.

### 6.8.2 Minimum Requirement

The minimum requirement for AAS BS in *MSR operation* is defined in
TS 37.105 \[6\], clause 9.8.2.

The minimum requirement for AAS BS in *single RAT UTRA operation* is
defined in TS 37.105 \[6\], clause 9.8.3.

The minimum requirement for AAS BS in *single RAT E-UTRA operation* is
defined in TS 37.105 \[6\], clause 9.8.4.

### 6.8.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify the ability of the transmitter units
associated with the *RIB* under test to restrict the generation of
intermodulation products in its nonlinear elements caused by presence of
the wanted signal and an interfering signal reaching the transmitter
unit via the RDN and antenna array from a co-located base station to
below specified levels.

### 6.8.4 Method of test

#### 6.8.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment:

\- normal; see annex G.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier:

\- M; see clause 4.12.1.

*Base Station RF Bandwidth* positions to be tested for multi-carrier:

\- M~RFBW~ in *single-band RIB*, see clause 4.12.1; B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~
and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ in *multi-band RIB*, see clause 4.12.1.

In addition, for *multi-band RIB*:

\- For B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~, emission testing above the highest operating
band may be omitted.

\- For B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~, emission testing below the lowest operating
band may be omitted.

\- FFS

Directions to be tested for:

As the requirement is based on TRP the beam pattern(s) may be set up to
optimise the TRP measurement procedure (see annex F).

#### 6.8.4.2 Procedure

1\) Select a CLTA according to parameters given in Table 4.15.2.2-1.

2\) Place the CLTA according to parameters given in Table 4.15.2.3-1.

3\) The test antenna(s) shall be dual (or single) polarized covering the
same frequency range as the *AAS BS* and the emission frequencies.

4\) Several test antennas are required to cover both the *AAS BS* and
the whole emission frequency range.

5\) Connect the test antenna and CLTA to the measurement equipment as
shown in Annex D1.5, Figures D.1.5-1.

6\) During the OTA emission measurements at the test antenna conducted
output(s), both *AAS BS* and CLTA are rotated around same axis.

7\) The OTA unwanted emissions measurement method shall be TRP,

17\) For *multi-band AAS BS* and single band tests, repeat the steps
above per involved band where single band test configurations and test
models shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

NOTE 1: The third order intermodulation products are centred at 2F1±F2
and 2F2±F1. The fifth order intermodulation products are centred at
3F1±2F2, 3F2±2F1, 4F1±F2, and 4F2±F1 where F1 represents the test signal
centre frequency or centre frequency of each sub-block and F2 represents
the interfering signal centre frequency. The widths of intermodulation
products are:

\- (n\*BW~F1~ + m\*BW~F2~) for the nF1±mF2 products;

\- (n\*BW~F2~ + m\*BW~F1~) for the nF2±mF1 products;

where BW~F1~ represents the test signal RF bandwidth or channel
bandwidth in case of single carrier, or sub-block bandwidth, and BW~F2~
represents the interfering signal bandwidth.

NOTE 2: During the conformance test the interfering signal can be
applied on one side of the wanted signal, while the transmitter
intermodulation emission is measured only on the opposite side of the
wanted signal. This applies for intermodulation products which are
within the operating band or OBUE region.

### 6.8.5 Test Requirement

#### 6.8.5.1 MSR test requirements

##### 6.8.5.1.1 General test requirement

intermodulation level shall not exceed the unwanted emission limits
specified for transmitter spurious emission in clause 6.7.6 (except
co-location spurious emission), operating band unwanted emission in
clause 6.7.5 and ACLR in clause 6.7.3 in the presence of a wanted signal
and an interfering signal according to table 6.8.5.1.1-1 for an *OTA AAS
BS* operating in BC1, BC2 and BC3.

The requirement is applicable outside the edges of the *Base Station RF
Bandwidth*. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the
*Base Station RF Bandwidth edges* or *radio bandwidth* edges.

For *RIB* supporting operation in *non-contiguous spectrum*, the
requirement is also applicable inside a *sub-block gap* for interfering
signal offsets where the interfering signal falls completely within the
*sub-block gap*. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to
the *sub-block* edges.

For *multi-band RIBs*, the requirement applies relative to the *Base
Station RF Bandwidth edges* of each operating band. In case the inter
*Base Station RF Bandwidth* gap is less than 15 MHz, the requirement in
the gap applies only for interfering signal offsets where the
interfering signal falls completely within the inter *Base Station RF
Bandwidth* gap.

#### 6.8.5.3 Single RAT E-UTRA operation

##### 6.8.5.3.1 General test requirement

In the frequency range relevant for this test, the transmitter
intermodulation level shall not exceed the unwanted emission limits in
clauses 6.7.6 (OTA spurious emission, except co-location spurious
emission), 6.7.5 (OTA OBUE) and 6.7.3 (OTA ACLR) in the presence of an
E-UTRA interfering signal according to according to table 6.8.5.3.1-1.

The requirement is applicable outside the *Base Station RF Bandwidth* or
*radio bandwidth*. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to
the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edges* or *radio bandwidth* edges.

For *RIBs* supporting operation in *non-contiguous spectrum*, the
requirement is also applicable inside a *sub-block gap* for interfering
signal offsets where the interfering signal falls completely within the
*sub-block gap*. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to
the *sub-block* edges.

For *multi-band RIBs*, the requirement applies relative to the *Base
Station RF Bandwidth edges* of each supported operating band. In case
the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* is less than 15 MHz, the requirement in the
gap applies only for interfering signal offsets where the interfering
signal falls completely within the inter *Base Station RF Bandwidth*
gap.

##### 6.8.5.3.2 Void

Table 6.8.5.3.2-1: Void

7 Radiated receiver characteristics
===================================

7.1 General
-----------

OTA receiver characteristics requirements apply to the *AAS BS*
including all its functional components active unless otherwise stated
in each requirement.

Unless otherwise stated the requirements in clause 7 apply during the
AAS BS *receive period.*

The requirements in clause 7 shall be met for any transmitter setting.

The (E-UTRA) throughput requirements defined for the receiver
characteristics in this clause do not assume HARQ retransmissions.

When the AAS BS is configured to receive multiple carriers, all the
throughput requirements are applicable for each received carrier.

Any radiated receiver test requirement specified in TS 37.105 \[6\] is
not applicable for AAS BS operation in Band 46.

Each requirement shall be met over the RoAoA specified.

For requirements which are to be met over the *OTA REFSENS RoAoA*
absolute requirement values are offset by the following term:

Δ~OTAREFSENS~ = 44.1 - 10\*log10(BeW~θ,REFSENS\*~BeW~φ,REFSENS~) (dB)
for the reference direction.

And

Δ~OTAREFSENS~ = 41.1 - 10\*log10(BeW~θ,REFSENS\*~BeW~φ,REFSENS~) (dB)
for all other directions.

For requirements which are to be met over the *minSENS RoAoA* absolute
requirement values are offset by the following term:

Δ~minSENS~ = P~REFSENS~ -- EIS~minSENS~ (dB)

7.2 OTA sensitivity
-------------------

### 7.2.1 Definition and applicability

The OTA sensitivity requirement is based upon the declaration of one or
more *OTA sensitivity direction declarations* (OSDD), related to an *AAS
BS receiver*.

The *AAS BS receiver* may optionally be capable of redirecting/changing
the *receiver target* by means of adjusting BS settings resulting in
multiple *sensitivity RoAoA*. The *sensitivity RoAoA* resulting from the
current AAS BS settings is the active *sensitivity RoAoA*.

If the AAS BS is capable of redirecting the *receiver target* related to
the OSDD then the OSDD shall include:

\- The set(s) of RAT, *Channel bandwidth* and declared minimum EIS level
applicable to any active *sensitivity RoAoA* inside the *receiver target
redirection range* in the OSDD.

\- A declared *receiver target redirection range*, describing all the
angles of arrival that can be addressed for the OSDD through alternative
settings in the *AAS BS*.

\- Five declared *sensitivity RoAoA* comprising the conformance testing
directions as detailed in \[7\].

\- The receiver target reference direction.

NOTE 1: Some of the declared *sensitivity RoAoA* may coincide depending
on the redirection capability.

NOTE 2: In addition to the declared *sensitivity RoAoA*, several
*sensitivity RoAoA* may be implicitly defined by the *receiver target
redirection range* without being explicitly declared in the OSDD.

NOTE 3: (Void)

If the *AAS BS* is not capable of redirecting the *receiver target*
related to the OSDD, then the OSDD includes only:

\- The set(s) of RAT, *Channel bandwidth* and declared minimum EIS level
applicable to the *sensitivity RoAoA* in the OSDD.

\- One declared active *sensitivity RoAoA*.

\- The receiver target reference direction.

NOTE 4: For *AAS BS* without target redirection capability, the declared
(fixed) *sensitivity RoAoA* is always the active *sensitivity RoAoA*.

The OTA sensitivity EIS level declaration shall apply to each supported
polarization, under the assumption of *polarization match*.

### 7.2.2 Minimum Requirement

The minimum requirement for MSR & NR operation is in TS 37.105 \[6\],
clause 10.2.2.

For AAS BS in *single RAT UTRA operation* the minimum requirement is
defined in TS 37.105 \[6\], clause 10.2.3.

For AAS BS in *single RAT E-UTRA operation* the minimum requirement is
defined in TS 37.105 \[6\], clause 10.2.4.

### 7.2.3 Test Purpose

The test purpose is to verify that the AAS BS can meet the BER or
throughput requirement for a specified measurement channel at the EIS
level and the range of angles of arrival declared in the OSDD.

### 7.2.4 Method of test

#### 7.2.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment:

\- normal: see annex G.2.

RF channels to be tested:

\- M; see clause 4.12.1.

Directions to be tested:

\- receiver target reference direction (see table 4.10-1, D10.9),

\- conformance test directions (see table 4.10-1, D10.10).

#### 7.2.4.2 Procedure

1\) Place the AAS BS with its manufacturer declared coordinate system
reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test
system, as shown in annex D1.1.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of the
AAS BS with the test system.

3\) Align the BS with the test antenna in the declared direction to be
tested.

4\) Ensure the polarization is accounted for such that all the power
from the test antenna is captured by the AAS BS under test.

5\) Configure the beam peak direction of the AAS BS according to
declared *reference beam direction pair* for the appropriate beam
identifier.

6\) Set the AAS BS to transmit the beam(s) of the same operational band
and RAT as the OSDD being tested according to the appropriate test
configuration in clause 5.

7\) Start the signal generator for the wanted signal to transmit:

\- 12.2 kbps DPCH with reference measurement channel defined in annex A
in TS 25.141 \[10\] (PN-9 data sequence or longer) for UTRA FDD.

\- UL reference measurement channel (12.2 kbps) defined in annex A.2.1
in TS 25.142 \[11\] for UTRA TDD 1.28Mcps operation.

\- The test signal as specified in clause 7.2.5.4 for E-UTRA.

\- The test signal as specified in clause 7.2.5.5 for NR.

8\) Set the test signal mean power so the calibrated radiated power at
the AAS BS Antenna Array coordinate system reference point is as
specified in clause 7.2.5.

9\) Measure:

\- BER according to annex C in TS 25.141 \[10\] for FDD UTRA.

\- BER according to annex F in TS 25.142 \[11\] for TDD UTRA.

\- Throughput according to annex E in TS 36.141 \[12\] for E-UTRA.

\- Throughput according to annex A in TS 38.141-2 \[34\] for NR.

10\) Repeat steps 3 to 9 for all OSDD(s) declared for the AAS BS (see
table 4.10-1, D10.1), and supported polarizations.

For multi-band capable AAS BS and single band tests, repeat the steps
above per involved band where single band test configurations and test
models shall apply with no carriers activated in the other band.

### 7.2.5 Test Requirements

#### 7.2.5.1 General

The minimum EIS level is a declared figure for each OSDD (see table
4.10-1, D10.6). The test requirement is calculated from the declared
value offset by the EIS Test Tolerance specified in clause 4.1.2.3.

#### 7.2.5.2 UTRA FDD Test Requirements

7.3 OTA Reference sensitivity level
-----------------------------------

### 7.3.1 Definition and applicability

The OTA REFSENS requirement is intended to ensure the OTA reference
sensitivity level for a declared *OTA REFSENS RoAoA*.

The OTA reference sensitivity power level EIS~REFSENS~ is the mean power
received at the RIB at which a reference performance requirement shall
be met for a specified reference measurement channel.

The OTA REFSENS requirement shall apply to each supported polarization,
under the assumption of *polarization match*.

### 7.3.2 Minimum Requirement

The minimum requirement for MSR & NR operation is in TS 37.105 \[6\],
clause 10.3.2.

The minimum requirement for AAS BS in *single RAT UTRA operation* is
defined in TS 37.105 \[6\], clause 10.3.3.

The minimum requirement for AAS BS in *single RAT E-UTRA operation* is
defined in TS 37.105 \[6\], clause 10.3.4.

### 7.3.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify that the AAS BS can meet the BER or
throughput requirement for a specified measurement channel at the
EIS~REFSENS~ level and the range of angles of arrival within the OTA
REFSENS RoAoA.

### 7.3.4 Method of test

#### 7.3.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment:

\- normal: see annex G.2.

RF channels to be tested:

\- B, M and T; see clause 4.12.1.

Directions to be tested:

\- OTA REFSENS *receiver target reference direction* (see table 4.10-2,
D11.30),

\- OTA REFSENS conformance test directions (see table 4.10-2, D11.31).

#### 7.3.4.2 Procedure

1\) Place the AAS BS with its manufacturer declared coordinate system
reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test
system, as shown in annex D1.1.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of the
AAS BS with the test system.

3\) Align the BS with the test antenna in the declared direction to be
tested.

4\) Ensure the polarization is accounted for such that all the power
from the test antenna is captured by the AAS BS under test.

5\) Configure the beam peak direction of the AAS BS according to
declared reference beam direction pair for the appropriate beam
identifier.

6\) Set the AAS BS to transmit the beam(s) of the same operational band
and RAT as the OTA REFSENS RoAoA being tested according to the
appropriate test configuration in clause 5.

7\) Start the signal generator for the wanted signal to transmit:

\- 12.2 kbps DPCH with reference measurement channel defined in annex A
in TS 25.141 \[10\] (PN-9 data sequence or longer) for UTRA FDD.

\- The test signal as specified in clause 7.3.5.3 for E-UTRA.

\- The test signal as specified in clause 7.3.5.4 for NR.

8\) Set the test signal mean power so the calibrated radiated power at
the AAS BS Antenna Array coordinate system reference point is as
specified in clause 7.3.5.

9\) Measure:

\- BER according to annex C in TS 25.141 \[10\] for FDD UTRA.

\- Throughput according to annex E in TS 36.141 \[12\] for E-UTRA.

\- Throughput according to annex A in TS 38.141-2 \[34\] for NR.

10\) Repeat steps 3 to 9 for all directions to be tested, and supported
polarizations.

For multi-band capable AAS BS and single band tests, repeat the steps
above per involved band where single band test configurations and test
models shall apply with no carriers activated in the other band.

### 7.3.5 Test Requirement

#### 7.3.5.1 General

The EIS~REFSENS~ level is the conducted REFSENS requirement value offset
by Δ~OTAREFSENS~. The test requirement is calculated from the
EIS~REFSENS~ level offset by the EIS~REFSENS~ Test Tolerance specified
in clause 4.1.2.3.

#### 7.3.5.2 UTRA FDD Test Requirements

The BER measurement result in step 9 of clause 7.3.4.2 shall not be
greater than the limit specified in table 7.3.5.2-1.

7.4 OTA Dynamic range
---------------------

### 7.4.1 Definition and applicability

The OTA dynamic range is a measure of the capability of the receiver
unit to receive a wanted signal in the presence of an interfering signal
inside the received *channel bandwidth* or the capability of receiving
high level of wanted signal.

The requirement applies at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave of
a received signal and the interfering signal are from the same direction
and are within the OTA REFSENS *RoAoA.*

The wanted and interfering signals apply to each supported polarization,
under the assumption of *polarization match*.

### 7.4.2 Minimum Requirement

For AAS BS in *MSR operation* the minimum requirement is defined in
TS 37.105 \[6\], clause 10.4.2.

For AAS BS in *single RAT UTRA operation* the minimum requirement is
defined in TS 37.105 \[6\], clause 10.4.3.

For AAS BS in *single RAT E-UTRA operation* the minimum requirement is
defined in TS 37.105 \[6\], clause 10.4.4.

### 7.4.3 Test purpose

To verify that at the dynamic range of the receiver shall fulfil the
specified limit.

### 7.4.4 Method of test

#### 7.4.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see annex G.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.12.1.

Directions to be tested: OTA REFSENS receiver target reference direction
(see table 4.10-2, D11.30).

#### 7.4.4.2 Procedure

1\) Place the AAS BS with its manufacturer declared coordinate system
reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test
system, as shown in Annex D2.2

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of the
AAS BS with the test system.

3\) Align the BS with the test antenna in the declared direction to be
tested.

4\) Align the NR BS to that the wanted signal and interferer signal is
*polarization matched* with the test antenna(s)..

5\) Set the test signal mean power so the calibrated radiated power at
the AAS BS Antenna Array coordinate system reference point is as
specified as follows:

a\) Set the signal generator for the wanted signal to transmit:

\- as specified in table 7.4.5.1-1 for UTRA.

\- as specified in table 7.4.5.2-3 to table 7.4.5.2-5 for E-UTRA.

\- as specified in table 7.4.5.3-3 to table 7.4.5.2-5 for NR.

b\) Set the Signal generator for the AWGN interfering signal at the same
frequency as the wanted signal to transmit:

\- as specified in table 7.4.5.1-1 for UTRA.

\- as specified in table 7.4.5.2-3 to table 7.4.5.2-5 for E-UTRA.

\- as specified in table 7.4.5.3-3 to table 7.4.5.23-5 for NR.

6\) Measure:

\- BER according to annex C in TS 25.141 \[10\] for FDD UTRA.

\- Throughput according to annex E in TS 36.141 \[12\] for E-UTRA.

\- Throughput according to TS 38.141-2 \[34\] for NR.

7\) Repeat for all supported polarizations.

In addition, for *multi-band RIB(s)*, the following steps shall apply:

8\) For *multi-band RIBs* and single band tests, repeat the steps above
per involved band where single band test configurations and test models
shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

### 7.4.5 Test Requirement

#### 7.4.5.1 UTRA FDD operation

The BER shall not exceed 0,001 for the parameters specified in table
7.3.5.1-1.

NOTE: If the above Test Requirement differs from the Minimum Requirement
then the Test Tolerance applied for this test is non-zero. The Test
Tolerance for this test is defined in clause 4.1.2 and the explanation
of how the Minimum Requirement has been relaxed by the Test Tolerance is
given in annex C.

#### 7.4.5.3 NR operation

For each measured carrier, the throughput measured in step 6 of
clause 7.4.4.2 shall be ≥ 95 % of the maximum throughput of the
reference measurement channel as specified in TS 38.104 \[33\] annex A.2
with parameters specified in tables 7.4.5.3-1 to 7.4.5.3-3.

  NOTE: The wanted signal mean power is the power level of a single instance of the corresponding reference measurement channel. This requirement shall be met for each consecutive application of a single instance of the reference measurement channel mapped to disjoint frequency ranges with a width corresponding to the number of resource blocks of the reference measurement channel each, except for one instance that might overlap one other instance to cover the full *BS channel bandwidth*.

  NOTE: The wanted signal mean power is the power level of a single instance of the corresponding reference measurement channel. This requirement shall be met for each consecutive application of a single instance of the reference measurement channel mapped to disjoint frequency ranges with a width corresponding to the number of resource blocks of the reference measurement channel each, except for one instance that might overlap one other instance to cover the full *BS channel bandwidth*.

7.5 OTA Adjacent channel selectivity, general blocking, and narrowband blocking
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 7.5.1 Definition and applicability

The adjacent channel selectivity (ACS), general blocking and narrowband
blocking characteristics are measures of the receiver unit ability to
receive a wanted signal at its assigned channel in the presence of an
unwanted interferer inside the operating band.

The requirement applies at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave of
a received signal and the interfering signal are from the same
direction, and:

\- when the wanted signal is based on EIS~REFSENS~ : the AoA of the
incident wave of a received signal and the interfering signal are within
the OTA REFSENS *RoAoA.*

\- when the wanted signal is based on EIS~minSENS~ : the AoA of the
incident wave of a received signal and the interfering signal are within
the *minSENS RoAoA*.

The wanted and interfering signals apply to each supported polarization,
under the assumption o*f polarization match*.

NOTE: For Single RAT requirements, the in-band selectivity
characteristics is referred to as \"adjacent channel selectivity\",
whereas for the MSR requirements, the corresponding property is referred
to as \"general blocking\" since the adjacent frequency range may not
carry a channel addressable from the interfered carrier.The in-band
blocking requirement applies from F~UL\_low~ - Δf~OOB~ to F~UL\_high~ +
Δf~OOB~, excluding the downlink frequency range of the *operating band*.
The Δf~OOB~ is defined in table 7.5-1.

Table 7.5-1: Δf~OOB~ offset for operating bands

  *Operating band* characteristics                Δf~OOB~ \[MHz\]
  ----------------------------------------------- -----------------
  F~UL\_high~ -- F~UL\_low~ \< 100 MHz            20
  100 MHz ≤ F~UL\_high~ -- F~UL\_low~ ≤ 900 MHz   60

### 7.5.2 Minimum Requirement

For AAS BS in *MSR operation* the minimum requirement is defined in
TS 37.105 \[6\], clause 10.5.2.

For AAS BS in *single RAT UTRA operation* the minimum requirement is
defined in TS 37.105 \[6\], clause 10.5.3.

For AAS BS in *single RAT E-UTRA operation* the minimum requirement is
defined in TS 37.105 \[6\], clause 10.5.4.

### 7.5.3 Test purpose

interference from unwanted signals at specified frequency offsets
without undue degradation of its sensitivity.

Table 7.5.5.1.1-2: Void

NOTE: The requirement in tables 7.5.5.1.1-1 and 7.5.5.1.1-2 assumes that
two operating bands, where the *downlink operating band* (see table
4.4-1 and table 4.4-2 in TS 37.141 \[13\].) of one band would be within
the in-band blocking region of the other band, are not deployed in the
same geographical area.

##### 7.5.5.1.2 General narrowband blocking test requirement

For the narrowband blocking requirement, the interfering signal shall be
an E-UTRA 1RB signal as specified in clause A.3 in TS 37.141 \[13\].

The requirement is applicable outside the *Base Station RF Bandwidth* or
*Maximum Radio Bandwidth*. The interfering signal offset is defined
relative to the *Base Station RF Bandwidth* *edges* or *Maximum Radio
Bandwidth* edges.

For RIBs supporting operation in non-contiguous spectrum, the
requirement applies in addition inside any *sub-block gap*, in case the
*sub-block gap* size is at least 3 MHz. The interfering signal offset is
defined relative to the sub-block edges inside the *sub-block gap*.

For *multi-band RIBs*, the requirement applies in addition inside any
*Inter RF Bandwidth gap* in case the gap size is at least 3 MHz. The
interfering signal offset is defined relative to the *Base Station RF
Bandwidth* *edges* inside the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*.

For the wanted and interfering signal coupled to the RIB, using the
parameters in table 7.5.5.1.2-1 the following requirements shall be met:

\- For any measured E-UTRA carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the
*maximum throughput* of the reference measurement channel defined in
clause 7.2.5.4.

\- For any measured UTRA FDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0.001 for
the reference measurement channel defined in clause 7.2.5.2.

\- For any NR carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channel defined for *BS type
1-O* in TS 38.104 \[33\], clause 10.3.2

##### 7.5.5.1.3 Additional BC3 blocking test requirement

This additional requirement only applies for BS operating in the same
geographical area as UTRA TDD.

The interfering signal is a 1,28Mcps UTRA TDD modulated signal as
specified in clause A.2 in TS 37.141 \[13\].

The requirement is applicable outside the *Base Station RF Bandwidth* or
*Maximum Radio Bandwidth*. The interfering signal offset is defined
relative to the *Base Station RF Bandwidth* *edges* or *Maximum Radio
Bandwidth* edges.

For *multi-band RIBs*, the requirement applies in addition inside any
*Inter RF Bandwidth gap*, in case the gap size is at least 4.8 MHz. The
interfering signal offset is defined relative to the *Base Station RF
Bandwidth* *edges* inside the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*.

For the wanted and interfering signal coupled to the RIB, using the
parameters in table 7.5.5.1.3-1, the following requirements shall be
met:

\- For any measured E-UTRA carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the
*maximum throughput* of the reference measurement channel defined in
clause 7.2.5.

#### 7.5.5.2 Single RAT UTRA FDD operation

For each measured carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0,001 for the
parameters specified in table 7.5.5.2-1.

For *multi-carrier RIB* the ACS requirement is applicable outside the
*Base Station RF Bandwidth* or *Maximum Radio Bandwidth*. The
interfering signal offset is defined relative to the lower/upper *Base
Station RF Bandwidth* *edges* or *Maximum Radio Bandwidth* edges.

For RIBs supporting operation in *non-contiguous spectrum* within any
operating band, the requirement applies in addition inside any
*sub-block gap*, in case the *sub-block gap* size is at least 5 MHz. The
interfering signal offset is defined relative to the lower/upper
sub-block edge inside the *sub-block gap* and is equal to -2.5 MHz/+2.5
MHz, respectively.

For a *multi-band RIBs*, the requirement applies in addition inside any
*Inter RF Bandwidth gap*, in case the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* size is
at least 5 MHz. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to
lower/upper *Base Station RF Bandwidth* *edges* inside the *Inter RF
Bandwidth gap* and is equal to -2.5 MHz/+2.5 MHz, respectively.

#### 7.5.5.3 Single RAT E-UTRA operation

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the *maximum throughput* of the
reference measurement channel.

For E-UTRA Wide Area BS, the wanted and the interfering signal coupled
to the BS antenna input are specified in tables 7.5.5.3-1 and 7.5.5.3-2
for narrowband blocking and 7.5.5.3-3 for ACS. The reference measurement
channel for the wanted signal is identified in table 7.3.5.3-1 for each
*channel bandwidth* and further specified in TS 36.104 \[4\] Annex A.

For E-UTRA Medium Range BS, the wanted and the interfering signal
coupled to the BS antenna input are specified in tables 7.5.5.3-1 and
7.5.5.3-2 for narrowband blocking and in table 7.5.5.3-5 for ACS.
Narrowband blocking requirements are not applied for Band 46. The
reference measurement channel for the wanted signal is identified in
table 7.3.5.3-3 for each *channel bandwidth* and further specified in
TS 36.104 \[4\] Annex A.

For E-UTRA Local Area BS, the wanted and the interfering signal coupled
to the BS antenna input are specified in tables 7.5.5.3-1 and 7.5.5.3-2
for narrowband blocking and 7.5.5.3-4 for ACS. Narrowband blocking
requirements are not applied for Band 46. The reference measurement
channel for the wanted signal is identified in table 7.3.5.3-2 for each
*channel bandwidth* and further specified in TS 36.104 \[4\] Annex A.

For narrowband blocking the OTA levels are applied referenced to 2
antenna gain offsets Δ~OTAREFSENS~ and Δ~minSENS~.

For ACS the OTA levels are applied referenced to Δ~minSENS~.

The ACS and narrowband blocking requirement is applicable outside the
*Base Station RF Bandwidth* or *Radio Bandwidth*. The interfering signal
offset is defined relative to the *Base station RF Bandwidth edges* or
*Radio Bandwidth* edges.

For RIBs supporting operation in *non-contiguous spectrum* within any
operating band, the ACS requirement applies in addition inside any
*sub-block gap*, in case the *sub-block gap* size is at least as wide as
the E-UTRA interfering signal in tables 7.5.5.3-3, 7.5.5.3-4 and
7.5.5.3-5. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the
*sub-block* edges inside the *sub-block gap*

For *multi-band RIBs*, the ACS requirement applies in addition inside
any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* at the RIB, in case the gap size is at
least as wide as the E-UTRA interfering signal in tables 7.5.5.3-3,
7.5.5.3-4 and 7.5.5.3-5. The interfering signal offset is defined
relative to the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edges* inside the *Inter RF
Bandwidth gap*.

For a RIBs operating in *non-contiguous spectrum* within any operating
band, the narrowband blocking requirement applies in addition inside any
*sub-block gap*, in case the *sub-block gap* size is at least as wide as
the *channel bandwidth* of the E-UTRA interfering signal in table
7.5.5.3-2. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the
*sub-block* edges inside the *sub-block gap*.

For *multi-band RIBs*,, the narrowband blocking requirement applies in
addition inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*, in case the *Inter RF
Bandwidth gap* size is at least as wide as the E-UTRA interfering signal
in table 7.5.5.3-2. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to
the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edges* inside the *Inter RF Bandwidth
gap*.

For a RIBs operating in *non-contiguous spectrum* within any operating
band, the narrowband blocking requirement applies in addition inside any
*sub-block gap*, in case the *sub-block gap* size is at least as wide as
the *channel bandwidth* of the E-UTRA interfering signal in table
7.5.5.3-2. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the
*sub-block* edges inside the *sub-block gap*.

For *multi-band RIBs*,, the narrowband blocking requirement applies in
addition inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*, in case the *Inter RF
Bandwidth gap* size is at least as wide as the E-UTRA interfering signal
in table 7.5.5.3-2. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to

NOTE: If the above Test Requirement differs from the Minimum Requirement
then the Test Tolerance applied for this test is non-zero. The Test
Tolerance for this test is defined in clause 4.1.2 and the explanation
of how the Minimum Requirement has been relaxed by the Test Tolerance is
given in annex C.

7.6 OTA Blocking
----------------

### 7.6.1 General

The blocking characteristics are a measure of the receiver unit ability
to receive a wanted signal at the RIB at its assigned channel in the
presence of an unwanted interferer.

The requirement applies at the *RIB* when the AoA of the incident wave
of the received signal and the interfering signal are the same direction
and are within the *minSENS RoAoA*

The wanted signal applies to each supported polarization, under the
assumption of *polarization match.* The interferer shall be polarization
matched for in-band frequencies and the polarization maintained for
out-of-band frequencies.

### 7.6.2 General Requirement

#### 7.6.2.1 Definition and applicability

#### 7.6.2.2 Minimum Requirement

The minimum requirement for AAS BS in *MSR operation* is defined in
TS 37.105 \[6\], clause 10.6.2.

The minimum requirement for AAS BS in *single RAT UTRA operation* is
defined in TS 37.105 \[6\], clause 10.6.3.

The minimum requirement for AAS BS in *single RAT E-UTRA operation* is
defined in TS 37.105 \[6\], clause 10.6.4.

#### 7.6.2.3 Test purpose

The test stresses the ability of the receiver unit associated with the
RIB under test to withstand high-level interference from unwanted
signals at specified frequency bands, without undue degradation of its
sensitivity.

#### 7.6.2.4 Method of test

##### 7.6.2.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment:

\- normal; see annex G.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier (SC):

\- M; see clause 4.12.1

*Base Station RF Bandwidth p*ositions to be tested for multi-carrier
(MC):

\- M~RFBW~ for *single-band RIB*, see clause 4.12.1, B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~
and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ for *multi-band RIB,* see clause 4.12.1.

In addition, for *multi-band RIB*:

\- For B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~, blocking testing above the highest operating
band may be omitted.

\- For B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~, blocking testing below the lowest operating
band may be omitted.

Directions to be tested:

\- OTA REFSENS receiver target reference direction (see table 4.10-2,
D11.30).

##### 7.6.2.4.2 Procedure

##### 7.6.2.4.2.1 General procedure {#general-procedure-5 .H6}

1\) Place *AAS BS* and the test antenna(s) according to Annex D.2.4.

2\) Place test antenna(s) in reference direction (see table 4.10-1,
D10.9) at far-field distance, aligned in all supported polarizations
with the *AAS BS* as depicted in Annex D.2.4.

3\) Connect test antenna(s) to the measurement equipment as shown in
Annex D.2.4.

4\) The test antenna(s) shall be dual (or single) polarized covering the
same frequency ranges as the *AAS BS* and the blocking frequencies. If
the test antenna does not cover both the wanted and interfering signal
frequencies, separate test antennas for the wanted and interfering
signal are required.

5\) The OTA blocking interferer is injected into the test antenna, with
the blocking interferer producing specified interferer field strength
level for each supported polarization. The interferer shall be
*polarization matched* in-band and the polarization maintained for
out-of-band frequencies.

6\) The *AAS BS* receives the wanted signal and the interferer signal
for supported polarization(s), in the reference direction (see table

#### 7.6.2.5 Test Requirement

##### 7.6.2.5.1 MSR operation

The OTA interfering signal RMS field-strength shall be set to 0.36 V/m
at the base station RIB per polarization.

NOTE: The RMS field-strength level in V/m is related to the interferer
EIRP level at a distance described as
![](media/image19.wmf){width="1.03125in" height="0.4791666666666667in"},
where EIRP is in W and r is in m; for example, 0.36 V/m is equivalent to
36 dBm at fixed distance of 30 m.

For a wanted and an interfering signal specified at the RIB using the
parameters in table 7.6.2.5.1-1, the following requirements shall be
met:

\- For any E-UTRA carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95 % of the
*maximum throughput* of the reference measurement channel defined in
TS 36.104 \[9\], clause 7.2.1.

\- For any UTRA FDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0.001 for the
reference measurement channel defined in TS 25.104 \[2\], clause 7.2.1.

##### 7.6.2.5.2 Single RAT UTRA FDD operation

In addition to the following in-band and narrowband requirements, the
general minimum requirements relating to out of band blocking defined
for MSR in clause 7.6.2.5.1-1 shall also be applied for single RAT UTRA
operation.

The minimum requirement for in-band blocking and narrowband blocking
UTRA operation is defined below:

The requirement is applicable outside the *Base Station RF Bandwidth* or
*Radio Bandwidth*. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to
the *Base Station RF Bandwidth* *edges* or *Radio Bandwidth* edges
applicable to each *RIB*.

For *RIB* supporting operation in *non-contiguous spectrum*, the
requirement applies in addition inside any *sub-block gap*, in case the
*sub-block gap* size is at least 15 MHz. The interfering signal offset
is defined relative to the *sub-block* edges inside the *sub-block gap*
and is equal to -7.5 MHz/+7.5 MHz, respectively.

For a *RIB* supporting operation in *non-contiguous spectrum* the
narrowband blocking requirement applies in addition inside any
*sub-block gap*, in case the *sub-block gap* size is at least 400 kHz or
600 kHz, depending on the operating band. The interfering signal offset
is defined relative to the *sub-block* edges inside the *sub-block gap*
and is equal to -200 kHz/+200 kHz or -300 kHz/+300 kHz, respectively.

For *multi-band RIBs* the requirement in the in-band blocking frequency
range applies for each supported operating band. The requirement applies
in addition inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*, in case *Inter RF
Bandwidth gap* size is at least 15 MHz. The interfering signal offset is
defined relative to lower/upper *Base Station RF Bandwidth* *edges*
inside the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* and is equal to -7.5 MHz/+7.5 MHz,
respectively.

For *multi-band RIBs* the narrowband blocking requirement applies in
addition inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*, in case the *Inter RF
Bandwidth gap* size is at least 400 kHz or 600 kHz, depending on the
operating band. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to
lower/upper *Base Station RF Bandwidth* *edges* inside the *Inter RF
Bandwidth gap* and is equal to -200 kHz/+200 kHz or -300 kHz/+300 kHz,
respectively.

For the wanted and interfering signal at the *RIB*, using the parameters
in tables 7.6.2.5.2-1 and 7.6.2.5.2-2, the following requirements shall
be met:

\- For any UTRA FDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0.001 for the
reference measurement channel defined in TS 25.104 \[2\], clause 7.2.1.

The OTA levels are applied referenced to two antenna gain offsets
Δ~OTAREFSENS~ and Δ~minSENS~.

##### 7.6.2.5.3 Single RAT E-UTRA operation

In addition to the following in-band and narrowband requirements, the
general minimum requirements relating to out of band blocking defined
for MSR in clause 7.6.2.5.1-1 shall also be applied for single RAT
E-UTRA operation.

The minimum requirement for in-band blocking E-UTRA operation is defined
below:

The requirement is applicable outside the *Base Station RF Bandwidth* or
*Radio Bandwidth*. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to
the *Base Station RF Bandwidth* *edges* or *Radio Bandwidth* edges
applicable to each *RIB*.

For *RIB* supporting operation in *non-contiguous spectrum*, the
requirement applies in addition inside any *sub-block gap*, in case the
*sub-block gap* size is at least 15 MHz. The interfering signal offset
is defined relative to the *sub-block* edges inside the *sub-block gap*.

For *multi-band RIBs*, the requirement applies in addition inside any
*Inter RF Bandwidth gap*, in case the gap size is at least 15 MHz. The
interfering signal offset is defined relative to the *Base Station RF
Bandwidth* *edges* inside the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*.

For the wanted and interfering signal at the *RIB*, using the parameters
in tables 7.6.2.5.3‑1 and 7.6.2.5.3‑2, the following requirements shall
be met:

\- For any E-UTRA carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95 % of the
*maximum throughput* of the reference measurement channel defined in
TS 36.104 \[4\], clause 7.2.1.

The OTA levels are applied referenced to two antenna gain offsets
Δ~OTAREFSENS~ and Δ~minSENS~.

For *multi-band RIBs*, the requirement applies according to table
7.6.2.5.3-1 for the in-band blocking frequency ranges of each supported
operating band.

### 7.6.3 Co-location Requirement

#### 7.6.3.1 Definition and applicability

This additional blocking requirement may be applied for the protection
of *AAS BS receivers* when E-UTRA BS, UTRA BS, NR BS, CDMA BS or
GSM/EDGE BS operating in a different frequency band are co-located with
an AAS BS.

The requirement is a co-location requirement. The interferer power
levels are specified at the CLTA conducted input(s).

Interfering signal shall be applied to the CLTA. The interfering power
is specified per polarization.

#### 7.6.3.2 Minimum Requirement

The minimum requirement for AAS BS in *MSR operation* is defined in
TS 37.105 \[6\], clause 10.6.2.

The minimum requirement for AAS BS in *single RAT UTRA operation* is
defined in TS 37.105 \[6\], clause 10.6.3.

The minimum requirement for AAS BS in *single RAT E-UTRA operation* is
defined in TS 37.105 \[6\], clause 10.6.4.

#### 7.6.3.3 Test purpose

The test stresses the ability of the receiver unit associated with the
*RIB* under test to withstand high-level interference from unwanted
signals at specified frequency bands, without undue degradation of its
sensitivity.

#### 7.6.3.4 Method of test

##### 7.6.3.4.1 Initial conditions

Initial conditions according to clause 7.6.2.4.1.

##### 7.6.3.4.2 Procedure

1\) Place *AAS BS* and CLTA as specified in clause 4.15, at the distance
d=0.1m.

2\) Several CLTAs are required to cover the whole co-location blocking
frequency ranges.

3\) Place test antenna in reference direction (see table 4.10-1, D10.9)
at far-field distance, aligned in all supported polarizations (single or
dual) with the *AAS BS* as depicted in Annex D.2.4.

4\) The test antenna shall be dual (or single) polarized, with the same
frequency range as the *AAS BS*, for the co-location blocking test case.

5\) Connect test antenna and CLTA to the measurement equipment as
depicted in Annex D.2.4.

6\) The *AAS BS* receives the wanted signal in all supported
polarizations (single or dual), in the reference direction (see table
4.10-1, D10.9) from the test antenna.

7\) The OTA co-location blocking interferer is injected into the CLTA.
The CLTA is fed with the co-location blocking interferer.

##### 7.6.3.4.2.1 MSR operation {#msr-operation-8 .H6}

See clause 7.6.2.4.2.2.

##### 7.6.3.4.2.2 Single RAT UTRA FDD operation {#single-rat-utra-fdd-operation-4 .H6}

See clause 7.6.2.4.2.3.

##### 7.6.3.4.2.3 Single RAT E-UTRA operation {#single-rat-e-utra-operation-9 .H6}

See clause 7.6.2.4.2.4.

#### 7.6.3.5 Test Requirement

##### 7.6.3.5.1 MSR operation

This additional blocking requirement may be applied for the protection
of *AAS BS receivers* when E-UTRA BS, UTRA BS, NR BS, CDMA BS or
GSM/EDGE BS operating in a different frequency band are co-located with
an AAS BS.

The requirement is a co-location requirement, the interferer power
levels specified at the CLTA conducted input(s).

The requirement is valid over *minSENS RoAoA*.

Interfering signal shall be applied to the CLTA. The interfering power
is specified per polarization.

When the wanted and an interfering signal using the parameters in table
7.6.3.5.1-1, the following requirements shall be met:

\- For any E-UTRA carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95 % of the
*maximum throughput* of the reference measurement channel defined in
TS 36.104 \[9\], clause 7.2.1.

\- For any UTRA FDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0.001 for the
reference measurement channel defined in TS 25.104 \[2\], clause 7.2.1.

\- For any NR carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95 % of the *maximum
throughput* of the reference measurement channel defined in
TS 38.104 \[33\], clause 7.2.1.

##### 7.6.3.5.2 Single RAT UTRA FDD operation

This additional blocking requirement may be applied for the protection
of *AAS BS receivers* when E-UTRA BS, UTRA BS, CDMA BS or GSM/EDGE BS
operating in a different frequency band are co-located with an AAS BS.

The requirement is a co-location requirement, the interferer power
levels specified at the CLTA conducted input(s).

The requirement is valid over *minSENS RoAoA*.

Interfering signal shall be applied to the CLTA. The interfering power
is specified per polarization.

When the wanted and an interfering signal using the parameters in table
7.6.3.5.1-1 for co-location with UTRA or E-UTRA systems and table
7.6.3.5.2-1 for co-location with GSM systems, the following requirements
shall be met:

\- For any UTRA FDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0.001 for the
reference measurement channel defined in TS 25.104 \[2\], clause 7.2.1.

##### 7.6.3.5.3 Single RAT E-UTRA operation

This additional blocking requirement may be applied for the protection
of *AAS BS receivers* when E-UTRA BS, UTRA BS, CDMA BS or GSM/EDGE BS
operating in a different frequency band are co-located with an AAS BS.

The requirement is a co-location requirement, the interferer power
levels specified at the CLTA conducted input(s).

The requirement is valid over *minSENS RoAoA*.

Interfering signal shall be applied to the CLTA. The interfering power
is specified per polarization.

When the wanted and an interfering signal using the parameters in table
7.6.3.5.1-1 for co-location with UTRA or E-UTRA systems and table
7.6.3.5.3-1 for co-location with GSM systems, the following requirements
shall be met:

\- For any E-UTRA carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95 % of the
*maximum throughput* of the reference measurement channel defined in
TS 36.104 \[9\], clause 7.2.1.

7.7 OTA Receiver spurious emissions
-----------------------------------

### 7.7.1 Definition and applicability

The receiver spurious emission requirement is the power of the emissions
radiated from the antenna array from a receiver unit. For an *OTA AAS
BS* operating in FDD, OTA RX spurious emissions requirement do not apply
as they are superseded by the OTA TX spurious emissions requirement.
This is due to the fact that TX and RX spurious emissions cannot be
distinguished in OTA domain.

NOTE: The OTA receiver spurious emission requirement applicability for
the AAS BS with the RX-only capabilities is FFS.

For an *OTA AAS BS* operating in TDD, the OTA receiver spurious
emissions requirement applies during the *transmitter OFF period* only.

For RX only *multi-band RIB*, the RX spurious emissions requirements are
subject to exclusion zones in each supported operating band.

### 7.7.2 Minimum Requirement

For an MSR AAS BS the minimum requirement is in TS 37.105 \[6\],
clause 10.7.2

For AAS BS in *single RAT E-UTRA* *operation* the minimum requirement is
defined in TS 37.105 \[6\], clause 10.7.4

For single RAT UTRA AAS BS the minimum requirement is in
TS 37.105 \[6\], clause 10.7.3

### 7.7.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify the receiver radiated spurious emissions
from the AAS BS at the RIB are within the specified requirements.

### 7.7.4 Method of test

#### 7.7.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see annex G.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.12.1.

RF bandwidth positions to be tested in single-band operation: - M~RFBW~,
see clause 4.12.1,

RF bandwidth positions to be tested in multi-band operation, see
clause 4.12.1.

\- B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ when testing from 30 MHz to F~DL\_Blow\_low~ -
Δf~OBUE~

\- B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ when testing from F~DL\_Bhigh\_high~ + Δf~OBUE~ to
12.75 GHz (or to 5^th^ harmonic)

\- B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~ when testing from
F~DL\_Blow\_high~ + Δf~OBUE~ to F~DL\_Bhigh\_low~ - Δf~OBUE~

Directions to be tested: Not applicable as Rx only TRP measurement.

#### 7.7.4.2 Procedure

The following procedure for measuring TRP is based on the directional
power measurements as described in Annex F. An alternative method to
measure TRP is to use a characterized and calibrated reverberation
chamber. If so, follow steps 1, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 10. When calibrated and
operated within the guidance of 3GPP TR 37.941 \[38\] the measurement
methods are applicable and selected depending on availability at the
test facility.

1\) Place the AAS BS at the positioner.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation (see
table 4.10-1, D9.2) of the AAS BS with the test system.

3\) Measurements shall use a measurement bandwidth in accordance to the
conditions in TS 37.104 \[5\] clause 6.6.1.

4\) The measurement device characteristics shall be:

\- Detection mode: True RMS.

The emission power should be averaged over an appropriate time duration
to ensure the measurement is within the measurement uncertainty in Table
4.1.2.3-1.

5\) Set the TDD AAS BS to receive only

6\) Orient the positioner (and BS) in order that the direction to be
tested aligns with the test antenna such that measurements to determine
TRP can be performed (see annex F).

7\) Measure the emission at the specified frequencies with specified
measurement bandwidth

8\) Repeat step 6-9 for all directions in the appropriated TRP
measurement grid needed for full TRP estimation (see annex F).

NOTE 1: The TRP measurement grid may not be the same for all measurement
frequencies.

NOTE 2: The frequency sweep or the TRP measurement grid sweep may be
done in any order.

9\) Calculate TRP at each specified frequency using the directional
measurements.

In addition, for *multi-band RIB(s)*, the following steps shall apply:

10\) For *multi-band RIBs* and single band tests, repeat the steps above
per involved band where single band test configurations and test models
shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

### 7.7.5 Test Requirement

The TRP of any spurious emission shall not exceed the limits in table
7.7.5-1:

In addition to the requirements in table 7.7.5-1, the power of any
spurious emission shall not exceed the levels specified for Protection
of the E-UTRA FDD BS receiver of own or different BS in clause 6.7.6.3
and for Co-existence with other systems in the same geographical area in
clause 6.7.6.4. In addition, the co-existence requirements for
co-located base stations specified in clause 6.7.6.5 may also be
applied.

7.8 OTA Receiver intermodulation
--------------------------------

### 7.8.1 Definition and applicability

Third and higher order mixing of the two interfering RF signals can
produce an interfering signal in the band of the desired channel.
Intermodulation response rejection is a measure of the capability of the
receiver unit to receive a wanted signal on its assigned channel
frequency in the presence of two interfering signals which have a
specific frequency relationship to the wanted signal.

The requirement applies at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave of
a received signal and the interfering signal are from the same
direction, and:

\- when the wanted signal is based on EIS~REFSENS~ : the AoA of the
incident wave of a received signal and the interfering signal are within
the OTA REFSENS *RoAoA.*

\- when the wanted signal is based on EIS~minSENS~ : the AoA of the
incident wave of a received signal and the interfering signal are within
the *minSENS RoAoA*.

The wanted and interfering signals apply to each supported polarization,
under the assumption of *polarization match*.

### 7.8.2 Minimum Requirement

For AAS BS in *MSR operation* the minimum requirement is defined in
TS 37.105 \[6\], clause 10.8.2.

For AAS BS in *single RAT UTRA operation* the minimum requirement is
defined in TS 37.105 \[6\], clause 10.8.3.

For AAS BS in *single RAT E-UTRA operation* the minimum requirement is
defined in TS 37.105 \[6\], clause 10.8.4.

### 7.8.3 Test purpose

The test purpose is to verify the ability of the receiver to inhibit the
generation of intermodulation products in its non-linear elements caused
by the presence of two high-level interfering signals at frequencies
with a specific relationship to the frequency of the wanted signal.

### 7.8.4 Method of test

#### 7.8.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see annex G.2.

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.12.1.

*Base Station RF Bandwidth* positions to be tested: For *single-band*
RIB*(s)*: M~RFBW~ if ATC4 is applicable; B~RFBW~ and T~RFBW~ for other
ATC, see clause 4.12.1. For *multi-band RIB(s)*: B~RFBW~\_T\'~RFBW~ and
B\'~RFBW~\_T~RFBW~, see clause 4.12.1.

Directions to be tested: OTA REFSENS receiver target reference direction
(see table 4.10-20 D11.30).

The general procedure steps apply to the procedures for all the RATs.

1\) Place the AAS BS with its manufacturer declared coordinate system
reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test
system, as shown in Annex D2.6.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of the
AAS BS with the test system.

3\) Align the BS with the test antenna in the declared direction to be
tested.

4\) Align the NR BS to that the wanted signal and interferer signal is
*polarization matched* with the test antenna(s)

5\) Configure the beam peak direction of the AAS BS according to
declared *reference beam direction pair* for the appropriate beam
identifier.

6\) Set the AAS BS to transmit the beam(s) of the same operational band
and RAT as the OSDD being tested according to the appropriate test
configuration in clause 5.

7\) Set the test signal mean power so the calibrated radiated power at
the AAS BS Antenna Array coordinate system reference point is as
specified as follows:

Set the signal generator for the wanted signal according to the
applicable test configuration (see clause 5) using applicable reference
measurement channel to transmit:

\- For E-UTRA see clause A.1 in TS 36.141 \[12\].

\- For UTRA FDD see clause A.2 in TS 25.141 \[10\].

\- For NR see clause A.1 in TS 38.141-2 \[34\].

##### 7.8.4.2.2 MSR operation

##### 7.8.4.4.2.1 Procedure for general and narrowband intermodulation {#procedure-for-general-and-narrowband-intermodulation .H6}

1\) Adjust the signal generators to the type of interfering signals,
levels and the frequency offsets as specified in table 7.8.5.1.1-1 and
Table 7.7.5.1.1-2 for general intermodulation requirement, and Table
7.8.5.1.2-1 and Table 7.8.5.1.2-2 for narrowband intermodulation
requirement.

2\) Measure the performance of the wanted signal at the receiver under
test, as defined in clause 7.8.5.1.1 and 7.8.5.1.2, for the relevant
carriers specified by the test configuration in clause 5.

3\) Repeat for all supported polarizations.

In addition, for *multi-band RIB(s)*, the following steps shall apply:

4\) For *multi-band RIBs* and single band tests, repeat the steps above
per involved band where single band test configurations and test models
shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

##### 7.8.4.2.3 Single RAT UTRA FDD operation

1\) Generate the wanted signal (reference signal) and adjust ATT1 to set
the signal level to the level specified in table 7.8.5.2-1. For a RIB
supporting multi-carrier operation, generate the wanted signal according
to the applicable test configuration (see clause 4.11) using applicable
reference measurement channel. Power settings are specified in table
7.8.5.2-1.

2\) Adjust the signal generators to the type of interfering signals and
the frequency offsets as specified in tables 7.8.5.2-1and 7.8.5.2-2.
Note that the GMSK modulated interfering signal shall have an ACLR of at
least 72 dB in order to eliminate the impact of interfering signal
adjacent channel leakage power on the intermodulation characteristics
measurement.

3\) Adjust the ATT2 and ATT3 to obtain the specified level of
interfering signal at the RIB.

4\) Measure the BER of the wanted signal. For a RIB supporting
multi-carrier operation the BER shall be measured for all relevant
carriers specified by the test configuration.

5\) Repeat for all supported polarizations.

In addition, for *multi-band RIB(s)*, the following steps shall apply:

6\) For *multi-band RIBs* and single band tests, repeat the steps above
per involved band where single band test configurations and test models
shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

##### 7.8.4.2.4 Single RAT E-UTRA operation

1\) Generate the wanted signal using the applicable test configuration
specified in clause 5 and adjust the signal level to the level specified
in table 7.8.5.3-1.

2\) Adjust the signal generators to the type of interfering signals,
levels and the frequency offsets as specified in table 7.8.5.3-2 for
intermodulation requirement and Table 7.8.5.3-3, Table 7.8.5.3-4 and
Table 7.8.5.3-5 for narrowband intermodulation requirement.

3\) Adjust the signal generators to obtain the specified level of
interfering signal.

4\) Measure the throughput according to annex E of
36.141 \[12\]TS 36.141 \[12\], for multi-carrier and/or CA operation the
throughput shall be measured for relevant carriers specified by the test
configuration specified in clause 5.

5\) Repeat for all supported polarizations.

In addition, for *multi-band RIB(s)*, the following steps shall apply:

6\) For *multi-band RIBs* and single band tests, repeat the steps above
per involved band where single band test configurations and test models
shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

### 7.8.5 Test Requirement

#### 7.8.5.1 MSR operation

##### 7.8.5.1.1 General intermodulation test requirement

Interfering signals shall be a CW signal and an E-UTRA, NR or UTRA
signal as specified in TS 37.104 \[5\], annex A.

The requirement is applicable outside the *Base Station RF Bandwidth* or
*Radio Bandwidth*. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to
the *Base Station RF Bandwidth* *edges* or *Radio Bandwidth* edges.

For *multi-band RIBs*, the requirement applies in addition inside any
*Inter RF Bandwidth gap* at those connectors, in case the gap size is at
least twice as wide as the UTRA/E-UTRA interfering signal centre
frequency offset from the *Base Station RF Bandwidth* *edge*. The
interfering signal offset is defined relative to the *Base Station RF
Bandwidth* *edges* inside the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*.

For the wanted signal at the assigned channel frequency and two
interfering signals at the RIB, using the parameters in tables
7.8.5.1.1-1 and 7.8.5.1.1-2, the following requirements shall be met:

\- For any E-UTRA carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95 % of the
*maximum throughput* of the reference measurement channel defined in
TS 36.104 \[4\], clause 7.2.1.

\- For any UTRA FDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0,001 for the
reference measurement channel defined in TS 25.104 \[2\], clause 7.2.1.

\- For any NR carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95 % of the *maximum
throughput* of the reference measurement channel defined in
TS 38.104 \[33\], clause 7.2.2.

The OTA levels are applied referenced to 2 antenna gain offsets
Δ~OTAREFSENS~ and Δ~minSENS~.

##### 7.8.5.1.2 General narrowband intermodulation test requirement

Interfering signals shall be a CW signal and an E-UTRA 1RB signal as
specified in TS 37.104 \[5\], annex A.

The requirement is applicable outside the *Base Station RF Bandwidth* or
*Radio Bandwidth*. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to
the *Base Station RF Bandwidth* *edges* or *Radio Bandwidth* edges.

For RIB supporting operation in *non-contiguous spectrum* within each
supported operating band, the requirement applies in addition inside any
*sub-block gap* in case the *sub-block gap* is at least as wide as the
*channel bandwidth* of the E-UTRA interfering signal in table
7.8.5.1.2-2. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the
*sub-block* edges inside the gap.

For *multi-band RIBs*, the requirement applies in addition inside any
*Inter RF Bandwidth gap,* in case the gap size is at least as wide as
the E-UTRA interfering signal in table 7.8.5.1.2-2. The interfering
signal offset is defined relative to the *Base Station RF Bandwidth*
*edges* inside the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*.

For the wanted signal at the assigned channel frequency and two
interfering signals at the RIB, using the parameters in tables
7.8.5.1.2-1 and 7.8.5.1.2-2, the following requirements shall be met:

\- For any E-UTRA carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95 % of the
*maximum throughput* of the reference measurement channel defined in
TS 36.104 \[4\], clause 7.2.5.3.

\- For any UTRA FDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0,001 for the
reference measurement channel defined in TS 25.104 \[2\],
clause 7.2.5.1.

\- For any NR carrier, the throughput shall be ≥ 95 % of the *maximum
throughput* of the reference measurement channel defined in

The static reference performance as specified in clause 10.3 and 10.2
shall be met for a Wide Area BS when the signals in table 7.8.5.2-1 and
table 7.8.5.2-2 are at the RIB.

The static reference performance as specified in clause 10.3 and 10.2
shall be met for a Medium range BS when the signals in table 7.8.5.2-3
and table 7.8.5.2-4 are at the RIB.

The static reference performance as specified in clause 10.3 and 10.2
shall be met for a Local Area BS when the signals in table 7.8.5.2-5 and
table 7.8.5.2-6 are at the RIB.

For RIB supporting operation in *non-contiguous spectrum* within each
supported operating band, the requirement applies in addition inside any
*sub-block gap* in case the *sub-block gap* is at least is at least
6.8 MHz. The CW interfering signal offset is defined relative to the
lower/upper *sub-block* edge inside the *sub-block gap* and is equal to
-1 MHz/+1 MHz, respectively. The GMSK modulated interfering signal
offset is defined relative to the lower/upper *sub-block* edge inside
the *sub-block gap* and is equal to -3.4 MHz/+3.4 MHz, respectively.

For *multi-band RIBs*, the requirement applies in addition inside any
*Inter RF Bandwidth gap*, in case the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap* size is
at least 6.8 MHz. The CW interfering signal offset is defined relative
to lower/upper *Base Station RF Bandwidth edges* inside the *Inter RF
Bandwidth gap* and is equal to -1 MHz/+1 MHz, respectively. The GMSK
modulated interfering signal offset is defined relative to lower/upper
*Base Station RF Bandwidth edges* inside the *Inter RF Bandwidth gap*
and is equal to -3.4 MHz/+3.4 MHz, respectively.

The OTA levels are applied referenced to 2 antenna gain offsets
Δ~OTAREFSENS~ and Δ~minSENS~.

#### 7.8.5.3 Single RAT E- UTRA operation

For E-UTRA, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the *maximum throughput* of
the reference measurement channel, with a wanted signal at the assigned
channel frequency and two interfering signals at the RIB, with the
conditions specified in tables 7.8.5.3-1 and 7.8.5.3-2 for
intermodulation performance and in tables 7.8.5.3-3, 7.8.5.3-4, and
7.8.5.3-5 for narrowband intermodulation performance. Narrowband
intermodulation requirements are not applied for Band 46. The reference
measurement channel for the wanted signal is identified in
table 10.8.4-1 to 6 for each *channel bandwidth* and further specified
in TS 36.104 \[4\] Annex A.

The receiver intermodulation requirement is applicable outside the *Base
Station RF Bandwidth* or *Radio Bandwidth edges*. The interfering signal
offset is defined relative to the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edges* or
*Radio Bandwidth edges*.

For RIB supporting operation in *non-contiguous spectrum* within each
supported operating band, the requirement applies in addition inside any
*sub-block gap* in case the *sub-block gap* is at least as wide as the
*channel bandwidth* of the E-UTRA interfering signal in table 7.8.5.3-3.
The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the *sub-block*
edges inside the *sub-block gap*.

For *multi-band RIBs*, the intermodulation requirement applies in
addition inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap,* in case the gap size is at
least as wide as the E-UTRA interfering signal centre frequency offset
from the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edge*.

For *multi-band RIBs*, the narrowband intermodulation requirement
applies in addition inside any *Inter RF Bandwidth gap,* in case the gap
size is at least as wide as the E-UTRA interfering signal in tables
7.8.5.3-3, 7.8.5.3-4 and 7.8.5.3-5. The interfering signal offset is
defined relative to the *Base Station RF Bandwidth edges* inside the
*Inter RF Bandwidth gap*.

The OTA levels are applied referenced to 2 antenna gain offsets
Δ~OTAREFSENS~ and Δ~minSENS~.

7.9 OTA In-channel selectivity
------------------------------

### 7.9.1 Definition and applicability

In-channel selectivity (ICS) is a measure of the receiver unit ability
to receive a wanted signal at its assigned resource block locations in
the presence of an interfering signal received at a larger power
spectral density. In this condition a throughput requirement shall be
met for a specified reference measurement channel.

The requirement applies at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave of
a received signal and the interfering signal are from the same direction
and are within the *minSENS RoAoA*.

The wanted and interfering signals apply to each supported polarization,
under the assumption of *polarization match*.

### 7.9.2 Minimum Requirement

For AAS BS in *MSR operation* the minimum requirement is defined in
TS 37.105 \[6\], clause 10.9.2.

For AAS BS in *single RAT UTRA operation* the minimum requirement is
defined in TS 37.105 \[6\], clause 10.9.3.

For AAS BS in *single RAT E-UTRA operation* the minimum requirement is
defined in TS 37.105 \[6\], clause 10.9.4.

### 7.9.3 Test purpose

The purpose of this test is to verify the ability of the receiver to
suppress the IQ leakage.

### 7.9.4 Method of test

#### 7.9.4.1 Initial conditions

Test environment: normal; see annex G.2

RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.12.1.

Directions to be tested: OTA REFSENS receiver target reference direction
(see table 4.10-2, D11.30).

#### 7.9.4.2 Procedure

1\) Place the AAS BS with its manufacturer declared coordinate system
reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test
system, as shown in Annex D1.1.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of the
AAS BS with the test system.

3\) Align the BS with the test antenna in the declared direction to be
tested.

4\) Align the NR BS to that the wanted signal and interferer signal is
*polarization matched* with the test antenna(s)

For each supported E-UTRA channel BW:

5\) Adjust the signal generator for the wanted signal as specified in
table 7.9.5.1-1 for AAS BS of Wide Area BS class, in table 7.9.5.1-2 for
AAS BS of Local Area BS class and in table 7.9.5.1-3 for AAS BS of
Medium Range BS class on one side of the F~C~.

6\) Adjust the signal generator for the interfering signal as specified
in table 7.9.5.1-1 for AAS BS of Wide Area BS class, in table 7.9.5.1-2
for AAS BS of Local Area BS class and in table 7.9.5.1-3 for AAS BS of
Medium Range BS class at opposite side of the F~C~ and adjacent to the
wanted signal.

7\) Measure throughput according to annex E in TS 36.141 \[12\].

8\) Repeat the measurement with the wanted signal on the other side of
the F~C~, and the interfering signal at opposite side of the F~C~ and
adjacent to the wanted signal.

9\) Repeat for all supported polarizations. 10

For each supported NR channel BW:

2\) Adjust the signal generator for the wanted signal as specified in
table 7.9.5.2-1 for AAS BS of Wide Area BS class, in table 7.9.5.2-2 for
AAS BS of Local Area BS class and in table 7.9.5.2-3 for AAS BS of
Medium Range BS class on one side of the F~C~.

3\) Adjust the signal generator for the interfering signal as specified
in table 7.9.5.2-1 for AAS BS of Wide Area BS class, in table 7.9.5.2-2
for AAS BS of Local Area BS class and in table 7.9.5.2-3 for AAS BS of
Medium Range BS class at opposite side of the F~C~ and adjacent to the
wanted signal.

4\) Measure throughput according to annex A in TS 38.141-2 \[34\].

5\) Repeat the measurement with the wanted signal on the other side of
the F~C~, and the interfering signal at opposite side of the F~C~ and
adjacent to the wanted signal.

In addition, for *multi-band RIB(s)*, the following steps shall apply:

10\) For *multi-band RIBs* and single band tests, repeat the steps above
per involved band where single band test configurations and test models
shall apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

### 7.9.5 Test Requirement

#### 7.9.5.1 E-UTRA test requirement

For E-UTRA, the throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the *maximum throughput* of
the reference measurement channel as specified in 3GPP 36.104 \[4\]
Annex A with parameters specified in table 7.9.5.1-1 for Wide Area BS,
in table 7.9.5.1-2 for Local Area BS and in table 7.9.5.1-3 for Medium
Range BS.

The OTA levels are applied referenced to Δ~minSENS~.

#### 7.9.5.2 NR test requirement

The requirement shall apply at the RIB when the AoA of the incident wave
of the received signal and the interfering signal are the same direction
and are within the *minSENS RoAoA*

The wanted and interfering signals applies to all supported
polarizations, under the assumption of *polarization matching.*

Details of the reference measurement channels can be found in
TS 38.141-2 \[34\] annex A.

8 Radiated performance requirements
===================================

8.1 General
-----------

Radiated performance requirements specify the ability of the OTA AAS BS
to correctly demodulate radiated signals in various propagation
conditions and configurations.

The demodulation requirements for an OTA AAS BS are limited to two OTA
*demodulations branches* as described in clause 8.1.1, and are the same
as non-AAS BS demodulation requirements specified for:

\- *Single RAT UTRA operation* in TS 25.104 \[2\] clause 8 for FDD
operation,

\- *Single RAT E-UTRA operation* in TS 36.104 \[4\], clauses 8.2 -- 8.4
(for PUSCH, PUCCH and PRACH) and 8.6 -- 8.7 (for subslot-PUSCH and
SPUCCH),

\- *MSR operation* in TS 37.105 \[6\], based on references to the single
RAT requirements in TS 25.104 \[2\] and TS 36.104 \[4\].

### 8.1.1 OTA demodulation branches

OTA performance requirements are only specified for up to 2
*demodulation branches*.

If the OTA AAS BS uses polarization diversity and has the ability to
maintain isolation between the signals for each of the *demodulation
branches*, then OTA performance requirements can be tested for up to two
*demodulation branches* (i.e. 1TX-1RX or 1TX-2RX test setup). When
tested for two *demodulation branches*, each demodulation branch maps to
one polarization.

If the OTA AAS BS does not use polarization diversity then OTA
performance requirements can only be tested for a single *demodulation
branch* (i.e. 1TX-1RX test setup).

8.2 Radiated performance requirements for MSR
---------------------------------------------

For OTA AAS BS in *single RAT UTRA operation*, minimum requirements for
radiated demodulation performance are specified in clause 8.3.

For OTA AAS BS in *single RAT E-UTRA operation*, minimum requirements
for radiated demodulation performance are specified in clause 8.4.

For OTA AAS BS in NR operation, minimum requirements for radiated
demodulation performance are specified in clause 8.5.

NOTE: Radiated performance requirements for MSR BS are applicable to the
multi-RAT of single RAT operation, but tested only in single RAT
configuration.

8.3 Radiated performance requirements for UTRA FDD
--------------------------------------------------

### 8.3.1 General

Radiated performance requirements for *single RAT UTRA operation* in FDD
are specified for the fixed reference channels (FRC) and propagation
conditions defined in TS 25.104 \[2\] annex A and annex B, respectively.
The requirements only apply to those FRCs that are supported by the OTA
AAS BS.

Unless stated otherwise, radiated performance requirements apply for a
single carrier only. Performance requirements for a BS supporting
DC-HSUPA or DB-DC-HSUPA are defined in terms of single carrier
requirements. The requirements in clause 8.3 shall be met with the
transmitter(s) ON.

NOTE: In normal operating conditions the *transceiver units* are
configured to transmit and receive at the same time. The transmitter
unit(s) associated with the RIB may be OFF for some of the tests in
clause 8.

In the referenced conducted test requirements from TS 25.141 \[10\] the
method to test describes connection to one or a number of BS antenna
connectors. When applying these methods to the OTA AAS BS, connection
shall be made to the RIB, based on one or two OTA *demodulation
branches*.

In the referred UTRA specifications and in this clause, the term \"BS
with RX diversity\" refers to performance requirements for two
*demodulation branches*, and the term \"BS without RX diversity\" refers
to performance requirements for one *demodulation branch*. For \"BS with
RX diversity\", only the BS performance requirements with Rx diversity
apply, otherwise only the BS performance requirements without Rx
diversity apply.

For testing purposes, there is one *demodulation branch* per active
polarization assumed. In tests performed with signal generators a
synchronization signal may be provided, from the BS to the signal
generator, to enable correct timing of the wanted signal.

The E~b~/N~0~ used is defined as:

Where:

is the received total energy of DPDCH, DPCCH, S-DPCCH, HS-DPCCH,
E-DPDCH, S-E-DPDCH, E-DPCCH and S-E-DPCCH per PN chip per *demodulation
branch* from all branches

is the total one-sided noise power spectral density due to all noise
sources

is the number of chips per frame

is the number of information bits in DTCH excluding CRC bits per frame

All Bit Error Ratio (BER) and Block Error ratio (BLER) measurements
shall be carried out according to the general rules for statistical
testing defined in ITU-T Recommendation O.153 \[30\] and
TS 25.141 \[10\], annex C.

If external BLER measurement is not used then the internal BLER
calculation shall be used instead. When internal BLER calculation is
used, the requirements of the verification test according to
TS 25.141 \[10\] clause 8.6 shall be met in advance.

### 8.3.2 Definitions and applicability

Definitions of radiated performance requirements in *single RAT UTRA
operation* in FDD and their applicability are the same as defined in
TS 25.141 \[10\], in requirement\'s specific \"Definition and
applicability\" clauses within 8.2 ‑ 8.13 clauses.

The following limitation apply for the radiated performance requirements
in *single RAT UTRA operation* in FDD:

\- All the radiated performance requirements referred from
TS 25.141 \[10\] are subject to 2Rx limitation in the OTA test setup, as
captured in clause 8.1.1.

\- If the OTA AAS BS does not use polarisation diversity then
performance requirements only apply to a single *demodulation branch*
(i.e. 1TX-1RX test setup).

\- If the OTA AAS BS uses polarisation diversity and has the ability to
maintain isolation between the performance requirements signals for each
of the *demodulation branches,* then performance requirements can be
applied to up to two *demodulation branches* (i.e. 1TX-2RX test setups).

NOTE: for the list of BS demodulation requirements which were found to
be feasible in OTA test setup with the above 2Rx limitation, refer to
TR 37.941 \[38\].

\- For FRC8 in TS 25.104 \[2\] the non E-DPCCH boosting and E-DPCCH
boosting requirement only apply for the option supported by the OTA AAS
BS.

\- Performance of signalling detection for 4C-HSDPA HS-DPCCH test shall
be performed only for the BS supporting 4C-HSDPA.

\- Performance of signalling detection for 8C-HSDPA HS-DPCCH test shall
be performed only for the BS supporting 8C-HSDPA.

\- The performance requirements for the high speed train scenarios
defined in TS 25.104 \[2\] are optional.

### 8.3.3 Minimum requirements

Minimum requirements for radiated performance requirements in *single
RAT UTRA operation* in FDD are the same as defined in TS 25.104 \[2\],
in requirement\'s specific \"Minimum requirement\" clauses within
8.2 ‑ 8.12 clauses, subject to limitations listed in clause 8.3.2.

### 8.3.4 Test purposes

Test purposes for the radiated performance requirements in *single RAT
UTRA operation* in FDD are the same as defined in TS 25.141 \[10\], in
requirement\'s specific \"Test purpose\" clauses within clauses
8.2 ‑ 8.13.

The radiated test shall verify the OTA AAS BS receiver\'s ability to
achieve requirement\'s specific performance metric under defined
propagation conditions emulated in OTA test chamber, for a given
E~b~/N~0~ (or E~c~/N~0~).

### 8.3.5 Method of test

#### 8.3.5.1 Initial conditions

Initial conditions of radiated performance requirements in *single RAT
UTRA operation* in FDD are the same as defined in TS 25.141 \[10\], in
requirement\'s specific \"Initial conditions\" clauses within 8.2 ‑ 8.13
clauses, with the exception, that instead of connecting the BS tester(s)
directly to antenna connector(s), either a single or two polarizations
should be transmitted via test antenna(s) in the OTA chamber, where each
polarization represents a *demodulation branch*.

The initial conditions for the radiated performance requirements in
*single RAT UTRA operation* in FDD are generalized as follows:

Test environment: normal, see annex G.2.

RF channels to be tested: B, M and T; see TS 25.141 \[10\], clause 4.8.

Direction to be tested: OTA REFSENS receiver target reference direction
(see table 4.10-1, D11.30).

#### 8.3.5.2 Procedure

1\) Place the OTA AAS BS with its manufacturer declared coordinate
system reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test
system, as shown in annex D.3.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of the
OTA AAS BS with the test system.

3\) Set the OTA AAS BS in the declared direction to be tested.

4\) Connect the BS tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading
simulators and/or AWGN generators (depending on the required OTA test
procedure) to a test antenna via a combining network in OTA test setup,
as shown in annex D.3.

5\) Apply the conducted performance test procedure appropriate to the
requirement as described in clause 8 of TS 25.141 \[10\]. Instead of
connection via an antenna connector, one of the RX antenna signals
should be transmitted on each polarization of the test antenna(s).

6\) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured
according to the corresponding UL reference measurement channel defined
in annex A in TS 25.141 \[10\], and according to additional test
parameters listed in respective conducted performance test procedure in
TS 25.141 \[10\].

a\. For RACH requirements: configure test signal generator to sends a
preamble according to the test signal pattern defined for RACH in
TS 25.141 \[10\].

7\) The multipath fading emulators shall be configured according to the
corresponding channel model defined in TS 25.141 \[10\], annex D.

8\) Adjust the test signal mean power so the calibrated radiated signal
level at the BS receiver is as specified in requirement\'s specific
clause 8 of TS 25.141 \[10\].

a\. For DCH requirements: Adjust the test signal mean power so the
calibrated radiated E~b~/N~0~value at the BS receiver is as specified in
requirement\'s specific clause 8 of TS 25.141 \[10\]. To achieve the
specified E~b~/N~0~, the ratio of the wanted signal level relative to
the AWGN signal should be adjusted to: 10 \* Log~10~(R~b~ / 3.84 \*
10^6^) + E~b~/N~0~ \[dB\].

b\. For RACH requirements: Adjust the test signal mean power so the
calibrated radiated E~b~/N~0~ (or E~c~/N~0~) value at the BS receiver is
as specified in requirement\'s specific clause 8 of TS 25.141 \[10\].

i\. For RACH preamble detection in static propagation, multipath fading
case 3, or in high speed train conditions: To achieve the specified
E~c~/N~0~, the ratio of the wanted signal level (of the preamble part)
relative to the AWGN signal at the BS receiver should be adjusted to:
E~c~/N~0 ~\[dB\].

ii\. For Demodulation of RACH message in static propagation conditions,
multipath fading case 3, or in high speed train conditions: To achieve
the specified E~c~/N~0~, the ratio of the wanted signal level (of the
message part) relative to the AWGN signal at the BS receiver should be
adjusted to: 10 \* Log~10~(TB / (TTI \* 3.84 \* 10^6^))
+ E~b~/N~0 ~\[dB\].

c\. For HS-DPCCH: Adjust the test signal mean power so the calibrated
radiated E~c~/N~0~ value at the BS receiver is as specified in
requirement\'s specific clause 8 of TS 25.141 \[10\]. To achieve the
specified E~c~/N~0~, the ratio of the wanted signal level relative to
the AWGN signal at the BS input should be adjusted to: E~c~/N~0 ~\[dB\].

The power level for the transmission may be set such that the AWGN level
at the RIB is equal to the AWGN level quoted in the test procedure of
TS 25.141 \[10\] minus Δ~OTAREFSENS~. Example of the AWGN levels for the
UTRA FDD requirements, with the Δ~OTAREFSENS~ correction are presented
in table 8.4.5.2-1.

Table 8.3.5.2-1: AWGN power level at the BS input for UTRA FDD
requirements

  -------------- -----------------------------------------
  BS class       AWGN power level
  Wide Area      - 84 - Δ~OTAREFSENS~ \[dBm\] / 3.84 MHz
  Medium Range   - 74 - Δ~OTAREFSENS~ \[dBm\] / 3.84 MHz
  Local Area     - 70 - Δ~OTAREFSENS~ \[dBm\] / 3.84 MHz
  -------------- -----------------------------------------

While signal power adjustment, reassure that the E~b~/N~0~ (or
E~c~/N~0~) at the BS receiver is not impacted by the noise floor.

9\) If RX diversity is not supported, ensure the *polarisation match* is
achieved among test antenna(s) and the OTA AAS BS under test, in order
to maximize the power at the BS receiver.

10\) For reference channels applicable to the BS, measure the
appropriate performance metric for the requirement as described in
clause 8 of TS 25.141 \[10\].

### 8.3.6 Test requirements

Test requirements of radiated performance requirements in *single RAT
UTRA operation* in FDD are the same as defined in TS 25.141 \[10\], in
requirement\'s specific \"Test requirement\" clauses within 8.2 ‑ 8.13
clauses, with the exception that shall be derived based on the OTA test
procedure, as in clause 8.3.5.2.

Applicability of radiated test requirements is subject to limitations
listed in clause 8.3.2.

In the referenced test requirements in this clause, the term \"number of
RX antennas\" should be replaced by one if a single polarization is
transmitted or by two if two polarizations are transmitted.

NOTE: If the above Test Requirement differs from the Minimum Requirement
then the Test Tolerance applied for this test is non-zero. The Test
Tolerance for this test and the explanation of how the Minimum
Requirement has been relaxed by the Test Tolerance is given in annex C.

8.4 Radiated performance requirements for E-UTRA
------------------------------------------------

### 8.4.1 General

Radiated performance requirements for *single RAT E-UTRA operation* are
specified for the fixed reference channels (FRC) and propagation
conditions defined in TS 36.104 \[4\] annex A and annex B, respectively.
The requirements only apply to those FRCs that are supported by the OTA
AAS BS.

Unless stated otherwise, radiated performance requirements apply for a
single carrier only. Radiated performance requirements for an OTA AAS BS
in E-UTRA operation supporting *carrier aggregation* are defined in
terms of single carrier requirements.

In the referred E-UTRA specification TS 36.104 \[4\], the term \"RX
antennas\" refers to *demodulation branches* (and not physical
antennas).

Conformance requirements can only be tested for 1 or 2 *demodulation
branches* depending on the number of polarizations supported by the BS,
with the required SNR /SINR (in case of E-UTRA demodulation
requirements), or required E~b~/N~0~ (in case of UTRA FDD demodulation
requirements) applied separately per polarization.

Only 2RX BS performance requirements apply when OTA AAS BS supports and
is tested with dual polarizations, except where requirements are defined
with 1RX only (e.g. HST) where the requirements shall be tested with
single polarization.

NOTE: OTA AAS BS can support more than 2 *demodulation branches*,
however OTA conformance testing can only be performed for 1 or 2
*demodulation branches*.

For tests in clause 8.4 the transmitters may be OFF.

The performance requirements for High Speed Train conditions are
optional.

The performance requirements for UL timing adjustment scenario 2 are
optional.

In tests performed with signal generators a synchronization signal may
be provided, from the BS to the signal generator, to enable correct
timing of the wanted signal.

For E-UTRA performance requirements the SNR used in this clause is
specified based on a single carrier and defined as:

SNR = S / N

Where:

S is the total signal energy in the subframe.

N is the noise energy in a bandwidth corresponding to the *transmission
bandwidth* over the duration of a subframe.

For enhanced E-UTRA performance requirements type A, the SINR used in
this clause is specified based on a single carrier and defined as:

SINR = S / N\'

Where:

S is the total signal energy in the subframe.

N\' is the summation of the received energy of the strongest interferers
explicitly defined in a test procedure plus the white noise energy *N*,
in a bandwidth corresponding to the *transmission bandwidth* over the
duration of a subframe. The respective energy of each interferer
relative to N\' is defined by its associated DIP value.

In the referenced conducted test requirements from TS 36.141 \[12\] the
method to test describes connection to one or a number of BS antenna
connectors. When applying these methods to the OTA AAS BS, connection
shall be made to the RIB, based on one or two OTA *demodulation
branches*.

### 8.4.2 Definitions and applicability

Definitions of radiated performance requirements in *single RAT E-UTRA
operation* and their applicability are the same as defined in
TS 36.141 \[12\], in requirement\'s specific \"Definition and
applicability\" clauses within 8.2 ‑ 8.4 clauses.

The following limitation apply for the radiated performance requirements
in *single RAT E-UTRA operation*:

\- All the radiated performance requirements referred from
TS 36.141 \[12\] are subject to 2Rx limitation in the OTA test setup, as
captured in clause 8.1.1.

\- If the OTA AAS BS does not use polarisation diversity then
performance requirements only apply to a single *demodulation branch*
(i.e. 1TX-1RX test setup).

\- If the OTA AAS BS uses polarisation diversity and has the ability to
maintain isolation between the performance requirements signals for each
of the *demodulation branches,* then performance requirements can be
applied to up to two *demodulation branches* (i.e. 1TX-2RX test setups).

NOTE: for the list of BS demodulation requirements which were found to
be feasible in OTA test setup with the above 2Rx limitation, refer to
TR 37.941 \[38\].

\- A test for a specific channel bandwidth is only applicable if the BS
supports it. For a BS supporting multiple channel bandwidths only the
tests for the lowest and the highest channel bandwidths supported by the
BS are applicable.

\- The performance requirements for High Speed Train conditions are
optional.

\- The performance requirements for UL timing adjustment scenario 2 are
optional.

\- Performance requirements for coverage enhancements are applicable
only to the AAS BS supporting coverage enhancement configured with
CEModeA. This applies to the following requirements:

\- Requirements for PUSCH supporting coverage enhancement

\- Requirements for PUSCH supporting Cat-M1 UEs

\- PUCCH performance requirements for supporting Cat-M1 UEs

\- PRACH missed detection, Cat-M1 mode

\- The enhanced performance requirements apply to AAS BS supporting the
enhanced performance requirements type A and/or type B.

\- Performance requirements for NB-IoT are not applicable to AAS BS.

For PUSCH performance requirements, the FRCs for the throughput
performance metric derivation are listed in TS 36.141 \[12\], annex A.

### 8.4.3 Minimum requirements

Minimum requirements for radiated performance requirements in *single
RAT E-UTRA operation* are the same as defined in TS 36.104 \[4\], in
requirement\'s specific \"Minimum requirement\" clauses within 8.2 ‑ 8.4
(for PUSCH, PUCCH and PRACH) and 8.6 -- 8.7 (for subslot-PUSCH and
SPUCCH), subject to limitations listed in clause 8.4.2.

### 8.4.4 Test purposes

Test purposes for the radiated performance requirements in *single RAT
E-UTRA operation* are the same as defined in TS 36.141 \[12\], in
requirement\'s specific \"Test purpose\" clauses within clauses
8.2 ‑ 8.4 (for PUSCH, PUCCH and PRACH) and 8.6 -- 8.7 (for subslot-PUSCH
and SPUCCH).

The radiated test shall verify the OTA AAS BS receiver\'s ability to
achieve requirement\'s specific performance metric under defined
propagation conditions emulated in OTA test chamber, for a given SNR (or
SINR).

### 8.4.5 Method of test

#### 8.4.5.1 Initial conditions

Initial conditions of radiated performance requirements in *single RAT
E-UTRA operation* are the same as defined in TS 36.141 \[12\], in
requirement\'s specific \"Initial conditions\" clauses within 8.2 ‑ 8.4
and 8.6 - 8.7, with the exception, that instead of connecting the BS
tester(s) directly to antenna connector(s), either a single or two
polarizations should be transmitted via test antenna(s) in the OTA
chamber, where each polarization represents a *demodulation branch*.

The initial conditions for the radiated performance requirements in
*single RAT E-UTRA operation* are generalized as follows:

Test environment: normal, annex G.2.

requirement as described in clause 8 of TS 36.141 \[12\]. Instead of
connection via an antenna connector, one of the RX antenna signals
should be transmitted on each polarization of the test antenna(s).

6\) The characteristics of the wanted/interfering signal shall be
configured according to the corresponding UL reference measurement
channel defined in annex A in TS 36.141 \[12\], and according to
additional test parameters listed in respective conducted performance
test procedure in TS 36.141 \[12\]. In case of PUCCH requirements, the
characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured according to
TS 36.211 \[28\].

7\) The multipath fading emulators shall be configured according to the
corresponding channel model defined in TS 36.141 \[12\], annex B.

8\) Adjust the test signal mean power so the calibrated radiated SNR (or
SINR) value at the BS receiver is as specified in requirement\'s
specific clause 8 of TS 36.141 \[12\], and that the SNR (or SINR) at the
BS receiver is not impacted by the noise floor.

The power level for the transmission may be set such that the AWGN level
at the RIB is equal to the AWGN level quoted in the test procedure of
TS 36.141 \[12\] minus Δ~OTAREFSENS~. Examples of the AWGN levels for
the E-UTRA PUSCH as well as for the PUCCH and PRACH requirements, with
the Δ~OTAREFSENS~ correction are presented in table 8.4.5.2-1 and table
8.4.5.2-2, respectively.

9\) If RX diversity is not supported, ensure the *polarisation match* is
achieved among test antenna(s) and the OTA AAS BS under test, in order
to maximize the power at the BS receiver.

10\) For reference channels applicable to the BS, measure the
appropriate performance metric for the requirement as described in
clause 8 of TS 36.141 \[12\].

### 8.4.6 Test requirements

Test requirements of radiated performance requirements in *single RAT
E-UTRA operation* are the same as defined in TS 36.141 \[12\], in
requirement\'s specific \"Test requirement\" clauses within 8.2 ‑ 8.4
and 8.6 -- 8.7, with the exception that shall be derived based on the
OTA test procedure, as in clause 8.4.5.2.

Applicability of radiated test requirements is subject to limitations
listed in clause 8.4.2.

In the referenced test requirements in this clause, the term \"number of
RX antennas\" should be replaced by one if a single polarization is
transmitted or by two if two polarizations are transmitted.

NOTE: If the above Test Requirement differs from the Minimum Requirement
then the Test Tolerance applied for this test is non-zero. The Test
Tolerance for this test and the explanation of how the Minimum
Requirement has been relaxed by the Test Tolerance is given in annex C.

8.5 Radiated performance requirements for NR
--------------------------------------------

### 8.5.1 General

Radiated performance requirements specify the ability of the *OTA AAS*
*BS* to correctly demodulate radiated signals in various conditions and
configurations. Radiated performance requirements are specified at the
RIB.

Radiated performance requirements for NR operation are specified for the
fixed reference channels (FRC) and propagation conditions defined in
TS 38.104 \[36\] annex A and annex G, respectively. The requirements
only apply to those FRCs that are supported by the *OTA AAS BS*.

The radiated performance requirements for *OTA AAS* *BS* are limited to
two OTA *demodulation branches* as described in clause 8.1.1.
Conformance requirements can only be tested for 1 or 2 *demodulation
branches* depending on the number of polarizations supported by the BS,
with the required SNR applied separately per polarization.

NOTE 1: The BS can support more than 2 *demodulation branches*, however
OTA conformance testing can only be performed for 1 or 2 *demodulation
branches*.

Unless stated otherwise, radiated performance requirements apply for a
single carrier only. Radiated performance requirements for NR operation
supporting *carrier aggregation* are defined in terms of single carrier
requirements.

For *OTA AAS* *BS* in FDD operation the requirements in clause 8 shall
be met with the transmitter units associated with the RIB in the
*operating* *band* turned ON.

NOTE 2: In normal operating conditions, *transceivers* in FDD operation
are configured to transmit and receive at the same time. The associated
transmitter unit(s) may be OFF for some of the tests as specified in
TS 38.141-2 \[34\].

In tests performed with signal generators a synchronization signal may
be provided, from the BS to the signal generator, to enable correct
timing of the wanted signal.

Conformance requirements can only be tested for 1 or 2 *demodulation
branches* depending on the number of polarizations supported by the BS,
with the required SNR applied separately per polarization.

Only 2RX BS performance requirements apply when *OTA AAS BS* supports
and is tested with dual polarizations.

NOTE 3: *OTA AAS BS* can support more than 2 *demodulation branches*,
however OTA conformance testing can only be performed for 1 or 2
*demodulation branches*.

The SNR used in this clause is specified based on a single carrier and
defined as:

SNR = S / N

Where:

S is the total signal energy in a slot on a RIB.

N is the noise energy in a bandwidth corresponding to the transmission
bandwidth over the duration of a slot on a RIB.

### 8.5.2 Definitions and applicability

Definitions of radiated performance requirements in NR operation and
their applicability are the same as defined in TS 38.141-2 \[34\], in
requirement\'s specific \"Definition and applicability\" clauses within
8.2 ‑ 8.4.

The following limitation apply for the radiated performance requirements
in NR operation:

\- All the radiated performance requirements referred from
TS 38.141-2 \[34\] are subject to 2RX limitation in the OTA test setup,
as captured in clause 8.1.1.

\- If the OTA AAS BS does not use polarisation diversity then
performance requirements only apply to a single *demodulation branch*
(i.e. 1TX-1RX test setup).

\- If the OTA AAS BS uses polarisation diversity and has the ability to
maintain isolation between the performance requirements signals for each
of the *demodulation branches,* then performance requirements can be
applied to up to two *demodulation branches* (i.e. 1TX-2RX test setups).

\- A test for a specific channel bandwidth is only applicable if the BS
supports it. For a BS supporting multiple channel bandwidths only the
tests for the lowest and the highest channel bandwidths supported by the
BS are applicable.

For PUSCH performance requirements, the FRCs for the throughput
performance metric derivation are listed in TS 38.141-2 \[34\], annex A.

### 8.5.3 Minimum requirements

Minimum requirements for radiated performance requirements in NR
operation are the same as defined in TS 38.104 \[36\], in requirement\'s
specific \"Minimum requirement\" clauses within 8.2 ‑ 8.4, subject to
limitations listed in clause 8.5.2.

### 8.5.4 Test purposes

Test purposes for the radiated performance requirements in NR operation
are the same as defined in TS 38.141-2 \[34\], in requirement\'s
specific \"Test purpose\" clauses within 8.2 ‑ 8.4.

The radiated test shall verify the OTA AAS BS receiver\'s ability to
achieve requirement\'s specific performance metric under defined
propagation conditions emulated in OTA test chamber, for a given SNR.

### 8.5.5 Method of test

#### 8.5.5.1 Initial conditions

Initial conditions of radiated performance requirements in NR operation
are the same as defined in TS 38.141-2 \[34\], in requirement\'s
specific \"Initial conditions\" clauses within 8.2 ‑ 8.4.

A single or two polarizations should be transmitted via test antenna(s)
in the OTA chamber, where each polarization represents a *demodulation
branch*.

The initial conditions for the radiated performance requirements in NR
operation are generalized as follows:

Test environment: normal, annex G.2.

RF channels to be tested: M; see TS 38.141-2 \[34\], clause 4.9.

Direction to be tested: OTA REFSENS receiver target reference direction
(see table 4.10-1, D11.30).

#### 8.5.5.2 Procedure

1\) Place the OTA AAS BS with its manufacturer declared coordinate
system reference point in the same place as calibrated point in the test
system, as shown in annex D.3.

2\) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of the
OTA AAS BS with the test system.

3\) Set the OTA AAS BS in the declared direction to be tested.

4\) Connect the BS tester generating the wanted signal, interference
signal(s), multipath fading simulators and/or AWGN generators (depending
on the required OTA test procedure) to a test antenna via a combining
network in OTA test setup, as shown in annex D.3.

5\) Apply the performance test procedure appropriate to the requirement
as described in clause 8 of TS 38.141-2 \[34\]. One of the RX antenna
signals should be transmitted on each polarization of the test
antenna(s).

6\) The characteristics of the wanted/interfering signal shall be
configured according to the corresponding UL reference measurement
channel defined in annex A in TS 38.141-2 \[34\], and according to
additional test parameters listed in respective performance test
procedures. In case of PUCCH requirements, the characteristics of the
wanted signal shall be configured according to TS 38.211 \[36\].

7\) The multipath fading emulators shall be configured according to the
corresponding channel model defined in TS 38.141-2 \[34\], annex J.

8\) Adjust the test signal mean power so the calibrated radiated SNR
value at the BS receiver is as specified in requirement\'s specific
clause 8 of TS 38.141-2 \[34\], and that the SNR at the BS receiver is
not impacted by the noise floor.

The power level for the transmission may be set such that the AWGN level
at the RIB is set according to the respective PUSCH, PUCCH, or PRACH
test procedures of TS 38.141-2 \[34\].

Table 8.2.1.4.2-2: Void

9\) If RX diversity is not supported, ensure the *polarisation match* is
achieved among test antenna(s) and the OTA AAS BS under test, in order
to maximize the power at the BS receiver.

10\) For reference channels applicable to the BS, measure the
appropriate performance metric for the requirement as described in
clause 8 of TS 38.141-2 \[34\].

### 8.5.6 Test requirements

Test requirements of radiated performance requirements in NR operation
are the same as defined in TS 38.141-2 \[34\], in requirement\'s
specific \"Test requirement\" clauses within 8.2 ‑ 8.4.

Applicability of radiated test requirements is subject to limitations
listed in clause 8.5.2.

NOTE: If the above Test Requirement differs from the Minimum Requirement
then the Test Tolerance applied for this test is non-zero. The Test
Tolerance for this test and the explanation of how the Minimum
Requirement has been relaxed by the Test Tolerance is given in annex C.

########  Annex A (normative): Test system characterization

The radiated measurement methods for AAS BS conformance testing were
described in TR 37.941 \[38\], including descriptions of their
limitations and testing applicability.

########  Annex B (normative): Calibration

The radiated measurement methods for AAS BS conformance testing were
described in TR 37.941 \[38\]. Calibration stage description was covered
for each of the identified Test Systems in the measurement\'s procedure
description, which covered two distinct stages: calibration stage and
measurement stage. This has been separately covered for transmitter and
for receiver requirements.

########  Annex C (informative): Test tolerances and derivation of test requirements

C.1 General
===========

The test requirements explicitly defined in this specification have been
calculated by relaxing the minimum requirements of the core
specification using the Test Tolerances defined here. When the Test
Tolerance is non-zero, the test requirements will differ from the
minimum requirements, and the formula used for this relaxation is given
in the following tables.

The Test Tolerances are derived from Test System uncertainties.

The Test Tolerances should not be modified for any reason e.g. to take
account of commonly known test system errors (such as mismatch, cable
loss, etc.).

Note that a formula for applying Test Tolerances is provided for all
tests.

NOTE: OTA test requirements for AAS BS are specified for Normal
conditions, only.

######## Annex E (normative): Estimation of Measurement Uncertainty

E.1 General
===========

Common measurement uncertainty budget calculation principle, was
described in TR 37.941 \[38\].

E.2 Measurement methodology descriptions
========================================

The AAS BS radiated measurement method descriptions, including
description of the calibration stage, and the measurement stage, are
described separately for each of the OTA tests, i.e. for radiated
transmit power and for OTA sensitivity test in TR 37.941 \[38\].

E.3 Measurement uncertainty budget format
=========================================

Each test methodology is characterized by different uncertainty
contributors. Moreover, within single test methodology, certain
uncertainty contributors will need to be modified, depending on the
transmitter, or receiver test. Therefore, separate uncertainty budget
format were collected for all considered Test Systems in
TR 37.941 \[38\], specifying uncertainty contributors for calibration
stage, as well as measurement stage.

E.4 Measurement uncertainty budgets
===================================

Descriptions of uncertainty assessment for radiated transmit power and
for OTA sensitivity test were described separately for each of the
considered Tests Systems as in TR 37.941 \[38\].

E.5 Measurement error contribution descriptions
===============================================

Detailed descriptions of the uncertainty contributors for the radiated
transmit power and OTA sensitivity test were described separately for
each of the considered Tests Systems as in TR 37.941 \[38\].

######## Annex F (normative): TRP measurement grids

F.1 General
===========

The annex describes various procedures for BS OTA TRP measurements.
These procedures can provide either an accurate or an over-estimate of
TRP values. The procedures for an accurate estimate can be applied to
all TRP requirements. However, if a TRP requirement does not need
accurate TRP estimate then the procedures for over-estimate of TRP may
be used in order to have a reasonable OTA test time. Pre-scan does not
provide an accurate TRP estimate or over-estimate of TRP. Pre-scan is a
fast but coarse method that is used to identify the spurious emission
frequencies with emission power as described in annex F.13. A sequential
measurement is then made at the emission frequencies, to assess the TRP
as described in annex F.2 to annex F.9.

When making TRP measurements the alignment between EUT and measurement
antenna is important to achieve expected measurement uncertainty;

1\. The measurement antenna needs to be aligned tangential to the
measurement surface forming a sphere around the EUT, in order to measure
the TRP properly.

2\. Test methods described in clauses F.5.1, F.5.2, F.10, F.11 and F.12
require angular alignment between the selected measurement grid and EUT
radiation pattern in order to measure peak values in the main beams.
Angular misalignment can lead to **differences in the actual and
measured angular positions of the intended maximum EIRP.**

**3.** Test methods described in clause F.5.3, F.6 and F.9 are designed
to be independent of rotations of the angular grid, and hence angular
alignment between the measurement grid and EUT is not needed.

F.2 Spherical equal angle grid
==============================

F.2.1 General
-------------

TRP~Estimate~ is defined as:

$\text{TRP}_{\text{Estimate}} = \frac{\pi}{2\text{NM}}\sum_{n = 0}^{N - 1}{\sum_{m = 0}^{M - 1}{\text{EIRP}(\theta_{n},\phi_{m})\sin\theta_{n}}}$

when EIRP measurements is used or as:

$\text{TRP}_{\text{Estimate}} = 4\pi d^{2}\frac{\pi}{2\text{NM}}\sum_{n = 1}^{N - 1}{\sum_{m = 0}^{M - 1}{P_{D}(\theta_{n},\phi_{m})\sin\theta_{n}}}$

when power density measurements are used, and d is the test distance. N
and M are the number of samples in the $\theta$ and $\phi$ angles. Each
($\theta_{n},\phi_{m}$) is a sampling point. The sampling angular
intervals for $\theta$ and $\phi$ angles are
$\Delta\theta = \frac{\pi}{N}$ and $\Delta\phi = \frac{2\pi}{M}$. The
sampling intervals $\Delta\theta$ and $\Delta\phi$ are described in
F.2.2.

F.2.2 Reference angular step criteria
-------------------------------------

The reference angular steps $\Delta\phi$ and $\Delta\theta$, in degrees,
are defined as:

$\Delta\theta_{\text{ref}} = min(\frac{180^{\circ}}{\pi}\frac{\lambda}{D},15^{\circ})$

$\Delta\phi_{\text{ref}} = \ min(\frac{180^{\circ}}{\pi}\frac{\lambda}{D_{\text{cyl}}},15^{\circ})$

The upper limit for these reference angular steps of $15^{\circ}$
ensures a low Summation Error (SE) when $\lambda\ $is large compared to
the DUT dimensions.

D~cyl~ and D are calculated as:

$D_{\text{cyl}} = \sqrt{d^{2} + w^{2}}$

$D = \sqrt{d^{2} + w^{2} + h^{2\ }}$

The definition of d, w and h is shown in Figure F.2.2-1. The radiation
source can be EUT antenna array or the whole of EUT.

![](media/image42.png){width="3.8020833333333335in" height="3.875in"}

Figure F.2.2-1: Dimensions of a radiation source: depth (d), width (w)
and height (h)

Optionally, in the case of a Uniform Linear Array (ULA), when d is
negligible (d $\approx 0$) and when the EUT is mounted along the yz
plane as shown in figure F.2.2-2, the reference angular step, in
degrees, can be determined by

$${\mathrm{\Delta}\theta}_{\text{ref}} = min(\frac{180^{{^\circ}}}{\pi}arcsin(\frac{\lambda}{D_{z}}),15^{{^\circ}})$$

$$\text{Δϕ}_{\text{ref}} = min(\frac{180^{{^\circ}}}{\pi}arcsin(\frac{\lambda}{D_{y}}),15^{{^\circ}})$$

Where D~y~ is the length of radiating parts of EUT along y-axis, D~z~ is
the length of radiating parts of EUTalong the z-axis and is wavelength
for the measured frequency.

height="3.1458333333333335in"}

Figure F.2.2-2: Spherical coordinate for OTA conformance testing of EUT

Where due to practical reasons such as time constraints or turn-table
precision, measurement with the reference steps is not practical,
sparser grids can be used. Use of sparse grids can lead to errors in TRP
assessment. In order to characterize these errors, the SF (sparsity
factor) of the grid is defined as:

$\text{SF} = max(\frac{\Delta\theta_{\text{grid}}}{\Delta\theta_{\text{ref}}},\frac{\Delta\phi_{\text{grid}}}{\Delta\phi_{\text{ref}}})$

Where $\text{Δθ}$ and $\text{Δϕ}$ are the actual angular steps used in
the measurement.

Alternatively, when the EUT radiating dimensions are not known. For each
frequency within the *downlink operating band* including Δf~OBUE~, the
reference angular steps can be specified in terms of the *beamwidth* of
the wanted signal as

$\mathrm{\Delta}\phi_{\text{ref}} = \frac{\lambda}{\lambda_{o}}\ \text{BeW}_{\phi}$

$\Delta\theta_{\text{ref}} = \frac{\lambda}{\lambda_{o}}\ \text{BeW}_{\theta}$

where λ~o~ is the wavelength of the wanted signal, and BeW~φ~ and BeW~θ~
are the *beamwidth* of the wanted signal in the φ-axis and θ-axis,
respectively.

BeW~φ~ and BeW~θ~ may be set to *beamwidth* declared for the *OTA AAS
BS* radiated transmit power requirement provided the same *beam* is
applied to test in-band TRP requirements.

NOTE: *Beamwidth* is approximately equal to half the first-null beam
width.

F.3 Spherical equal area grid
=============================

TRP~Estimate~ is defined as:

$\text{TRP}_{\text{Estimate}} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n = 1}^{N}{\text{EIRP}(\theta_{n},\phi_{n})}$

N is the total number of samples and specified as:

$N \geq \frac{4\pi}{\mathrm{\Delta}\theta_{\text{ref}}\mathrm{\Delta}\phi_{\text{ref}}}$

The sampling intervals ${\Delta\theta}_{\text{ref}}$ and
${\Delta\phi}_{\text{ref}}$ are described in F.2.2. Each
($\theta_{n},\phi_{n}$) is a sampling point.

F.4 Spherical Fibonacci grid
============================

TRP~Estimate~ is defined as:

$\text{TRP}_{\text{Estimate}} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n = 0}^{N - 1}{\text{EIRP}(\theta_{n},\phi_{n})}$

*N* is the total number of samples and specified as:

$N \geq \frac{4\pi}{\mathrm{\Delta}\theta_{\text{ref}}\mathrm{\Delta}\phi_{\text{ref}}}$

The sampling intervals ${\Delta\theta}_{\text{ref}}$ and
${\Delta\phi}_{\text{ref}}$ are described in F.2.2. Each
($\theta_{n},\phi_{n}$) is a sampling point, where $\theta_{n}$ and
$\phi_{n}$, in degrees, are defined as:

$\theta_{n} = \cos^{- 1}\left( 1 - \frac{2n + 1}{N} \right)$

$\phi_{n} = \frac{360^{{^\circ}}n}{\Psi},\ \Psi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$

F.5 Orthogonal cut grid
=======================

F.5.1 General
-------------

Here, at least two cuts (default) shall be used, an optional third cut
can be used. The alignment of the cuts must be along the symmetry planes
of the antenna array. No alignment is required for spurious emissions.

When alignment is required:

1\. The first mandatory cut is a horizontal cut passing through the peak
direction of the main beam.

2\. The second mandatory is a vertical cut passing through the peak
direction of the main beam. Using the data from these two mandatory
cuts, a conditional pattern multiplication can be used.

3\. The third optional cut is a vertical cut orthogonal to the first and
the second cut.

When alignment is not required, the cuts can be aligned arbitrarily.

Once the number and the orientation of the cuts are decided, the total
EIRP is measured on the orthogonal cuts and the TRP is then calculated
as follows: First the contributions from each cut is calculated as:

$\text{EIRP}_{\text{av},\text{cut} - n} = \frac{1}{P}\sum_{j = 1}^{P}{\text{EIRP}(j)}$

where *P* is the number of sampling points in the cut. The final
contribution for all cuts is calculated as:

$\text{TRP}_{\text{Estimate}} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n = 1}^{N}\text{EIRP}_{\text{av},\text{cut} - n}$

where N is the number of cuts. Note that when orthogonal cuts are
measured, the intersection points are measured multiple times and the
repeated values can be removed from the samples before averaging.

When two cuts measurements are used, a conditional pattern
multiplication can be applied. The following are the conditions for
applying pattern multiplication:

i\. The vertical cut (and the main beam) is in the $\text{xz}$ -plane

ii\. The frequency of the emission is within the downlink operating
band.

iii\. The bandwidth of the emission is the same as the bandwidth of the
in-band modulated signal

iv\. The emission appears/disappears when the Tx power is turned on/off.

v\. The antenna arrays of the EUT

1\. Have rectangular grids of antenna element positions

2\. Have symmetry planes that are vertical and horizontal.

3\. Have parallel antenna planes

The antenna array is here assumed to be placed in the *yz*-plane. The
pattern multiplication is performed in *uv*-coordinates and the data in
the two cuts are denoted $\text{EIRP}_{cut1}^{}\left( \phi \right)$ at
$\theta = \theta_{H}\ $and a vertical cut with data
$\text{EIRP}_{cut2}^{}\left( \theta \right)$ at $\phi = 0$. The data is
split in two parts corresponding to the forward and backward
hemispheres. The *uv*-coordinates are the projections of the angular
directions onto the antenna plane, here the *yz*-plane. Using the
spherical coordinates as depicted in figure F.2.2.-1 the *u* and *v*
coordinates are defined as:

$\left\{ \begin{matrix}
u = \sin{\theta\sin\phi} \\
v = \cos\theta \\
\end{matrix} \right.\ $

Note that only the data on the cuts are measured.

Calculate power density/EIRP values outside the two cardinal cuts as

$\text{EIRP}\left( u,v \right) = \frac{\text{EIR}P_{cut1}^{}\left( u \right)\text{EIR}P_{cut2}^{}\left( v \right)}{\text{EIRP}\left( 0,v_{H} \right)}$

The pattern multiplication is applied separately for the forward (fwd)
and backward (bwd) hemisphere. The TRP is then calculated as:

$TRP = \frac{1}{4\pi}\left\lbrack \iint_{\text{fwd}}^{}{\text{EIRP}_{\text{fwd}}^{}\left( u,v \right)\frac{dudv}{\sqrt{1 - u^{2} - v^{2}}} +}\iint_{\text{bwd}}^{}{\text{EIRP}_{\text{bwd}}^{}\left( u,v \right)\frac{dudv}{\sqrt{1 - u^{2} - v^{2}}}} \right\rbrack$

NOTE: The numerical singularity at $u^{2} + v^{2} = 1$ must be treated
with care, e.g. by change of variables.

F.5.2 Operating band unwanted emissions
---------------------------------------

The procedure is as follows:

1\) Follow steps described in annex I.5.1 for the first two mandatory
cuts and calculate the TRP~Estimate~.

2\) Compare the TRP~Estimate~ to the limit.

3\) If the TRP~Estimate~ is above the limit, perform the measurement on
an additional third cut and repeat steps 1 to 2.

F.5.3 Spurious unwanted emissions
---------------------------------

The procedure is as follows:

1\) Follow steps described in annex F.5.1 for two cuts and calculate the
preliminary TRP~Estimate~.

2\) Add the appropriate correction factor ΔTRP according to table
F.5.3-1 to ensure overestimation with 95% confidence.

3\) Compare the corrected TRP~Estimate~ (including ΔTRP) to the limit.

4\) If the corrected TRP~Estimate~ is above the limit, perform the
measurement on an additional third cut and repeat steps 1 to 3.

  Correction factor ΔTRP (dB)   2.0          2.5

F.6 Wave vector space grid
==========================

If EUT is mounted along the yz plane as shown in figure F.2.2-1, the
reference step in wave vector space can be determined by:

$\Delta u_{\text{ref}} = \frac{\lambda}{D_{y}}$

$\Delta v_{\text{ref}} = \frac{\lambda}{D_{z}}$

where *D~y~* is the length of radiating parts of EUT along y-axis,
*D~z~* is the length of radiating parts of EUT along the z-axis.

According to the relationship between the normalized wave vector and
spherical coordinate, the wave vector can be represented as following:

$u = \sin\left( \theta \right)\sin\left( \phi \right),\ v = cos(\theta)$

The total radiated power (TRP) in the wave vector space is determined
by:

$TRP = \frac{{\Delta u}_{}\Delta v_{}}{4\pi}\left( \sum_{\begin{matrix}
u^{2} + v^{2} < 1 \\
\cos\phi > 0 \\
\end{matrix}}^{}{\frac{\text{EIRP}\left( \theta_{n},\phi_{m,n} \right)}{\sin\theta_{n}\left| \cos\phi_{m,n} \right|}\ } + \sum_{\begin{matrix}
u^{2} + v^{2} < 1 \\
\cos\phi < 0 \\
\end{matrix}}^{}{\frac{\text{EIRP}\left( \theta_{n},\phi_{m,n} \right)}{\sin\theta_{n}\left| \cos\phi_{m,n} \right|}\ } \right)$

Where due to practical reasons such as time constraints or turn-table
precision, measurement with the reference steps is not practical,
sparser grids can be used. Use of sparse grids can lead to errors in TRP
assessment. In order to characterize these errors, the SF (sparsity
factor) of the grid is defined as:

$\text{SF} = max(\frac{\Delta u_{\text{grid}}}{\Delta u_{\text{ref}}},\frac{\Delta v_{\text{grid}}}{\Delta v_{\text{ref}}})$

Where $\Delta u_{\text{grid}}$and $\Delta v_{\text{grid}}$ are the
actual steps used in the wave vector space in the measurement and the
upper bound of their value is 15 degrees.

F.7 Orthogonal 2 cuts with pattern multiplication
=================================================

This method can be used when the antenna symmetries are compatible with
pattern multiplication, see Clause F.1.2.4. The procedure is as follows:

1\. Calculate the reference angular steps as described in Clause F.1.2.

2\. Align the EUT to allow for proper pattern multiplication. See Clause
F.5. Measure EIRP on two orthogonal cuts with steps smaller or equal to
the reference steps according to step 1.

3\. Apply pattern multiplication according to Clause F.5 to extrapolate
the two cuts data to full-sphere.

4\. Apply numerical integration to obtain the TRP estimate as described
in Clause F.5.

F.8 Void
========

F.9 Full sphere with sparse sampling
====================================

The procedure is as follows:

1\. Set the angular grid:

a\. Non-harmonic frequencies: choose the angular steps $\Delta\phi$ and
$\Delta\theta$ smaller than or equal to 15 degrees. Calculate the
sparsity factor (SF) as

$SF = \max\left( \frac{\Delta\phi}{\Delta\phi_{\text{ref}}},\frac{\Delta\theta}{\Delta\theta_{\text{ref}}} \right)$

and the correction factor as:

$\text{ΔTRP} = \frac{SF - 1}{SF_{\max} - 1} \cdot 1.0\ dB,$

where $SF_{\max}$ *corresponds to 15 degrees angular step.* If the
sparsity factor is smaller than 1, the correction factor ΔTRP is 0 dB.

b\. Harmonic frequencies with fixed beam test signal: choose the angular
steps smaller than or equal to the reference angular steps
$\Delta\phi_{\text{ref}}$ and $\Delta\theta_{\text{ref}}$. Correction
factor ΔTRP is 0 dB.

c\. Harmonic frequencies with beam sweeping test signal: set the angular
steps to 15 degrees. Correction factor is ΔTRP 0 dB.

2\. Apply a suitable numerical integration to calculate the TRP
estimate.

3\. Add the appropriate correction factor ΔTRP according to step 1 to
ensure an overestimation with 95% confidence.

4\. Compare the (TRP estimate + ΔTRP) with the limit. If the (TRP
estimate + ΔTRP) is above the limit, choose a smaller angular step and
repeat steps 2-4. If the sparsity factor is less than one, no
significant improvement of accuracy is expected.

F.10 Beam-based directions
==========================

Beam-based direction can be used in the base station operating band only
if the directivity of the radiation pattern of the emssions being
measured is known.*band*. TRP~Estimate~ is defined as:

$\text{TRP}_{\text{Estimate}} = \frac{\text{EIRP}_{\text{peak}}}{D_{\text{EUT}}}$,

where $\text{EIRP}_{\text{peak}}$ is the maximum EIRP in the *beam peak
direction* within a particular *beam direction pair* and
$D_{\text{EUT}}$ is directivity of the EUT antenna.

F.11 Peak method
================

The peak method can be used when frequencies with unwanted peak
emissions are identified during pre-scan. The method does not provide an
estimate of TRP.

For each peak emission frequency identified during pre-scan, measure
peak EIRP or power density as follows:

1\. Move EUT and test antenna to the same position where the peak
emission is recorded during the pre-scan.

2\. Move the EUT around the position and test antenna orientation to
find the final peak EIRP or power density.

3\. The measured peak power density or EIRP shall be used to demonstrate
conformance.

NOTE: Peak EIRP is the linear sum of two orthogonal polarised
components.

F.12 Equal sector with peak average
===================================

Equal sector with peak average can be performed on frequencies with
unwanted peak emission, which are considered by the peak method for
further measurements.

The spherical angle $\phi$ is divided into K equal sectors. If the
largest dimension of EUT is less than 60 cm, then each sector is a half
quadrant of 45°.

For each peak emission frequency, measure peak EIRP of beams belonging
to different sectors of the sphere as follows:

1\. Move EUT and test antenna to the same position where the emission
peak is recorded during the pre-scan.

2\. Move EUT around the position and test antenna orientation to find
the final peak EIRP.

3\. Repeat Steps 1 to 2 until all sectors are covered.

4\. Calculate TRP~Estimate~ as:

$\text{TRP}_{\text{Estimate}} = \frac{1}{K}\sum_{k = 1}^{K}\text{EIRP}_{k}$,

where $\text{EIRP}_{k}$ is the peak EIRP in the kth sector.

NOTE: Peak EIRP is the linear sum of two orthogonal polarised
components.

F.13 Pre-scan
=============

Pre-scan is used to identify frequencies with unwanted emission power
levels above a certain threshold. The pre-scan does not provide an
estimate of TRP. An emission frequency identified by a pre-scan may be
further investigated by any of the TRP measurement methods in this
annex.

The procedure for pre-scan is as follows:

1\. Scan the entire surface around EUT.

2\. Rotate test antenna to cover all possible polarisations of emissions
to detect maximum emissions.

3\. Record the list of frequencies and corresponding unwanted emission
power levels, EUT spatial positions, and test antenna polarization for
which the maximum emission levels occur.

4\. Emissions which are 20 dB or more below the specified limit shall
not require further measurements.

######## Annex G (normative): Environmental requirements for the BS equipment

G.1 General
===========

For each test in the present document, the environmental conditions
under which the AAS BS is to be tested are defined. The environmental
conditions and class shall be from the relevant IEC specifications or
the corresponding ETSI specifications.

For OTA requirements where it is not possible to environmentally control
the entire calibrated OTA chamber either localised control of the AAS BS
hardware or alternative OTA measurements which are then related to the
original specification are acceptable.

G.2 Normal test environment
===========================

When a normal test environment is specified for a test, the test should
be performed within the minimum and maximum limits of the conditions
stated in table G.2-1.

Table G.2-1: Limits of conditions for Normal Test Environment

  --------------------- ------------------------------------------ ---------
  Condition             Minimum                                    Maximum
  Barometric pressure   86 kPa                                     106 kPa
  Temperature           15°C                                       30°C
  Relative Humidity     20 %                                       85 %
  Power supply          Nominal, as declared by the manufacturer   
  Vibration             Negligible                                 
  --------------------- ------------------------------------------ ---------

The ranges of barometric pressure, temperature and humidity represent
the maximum variation expected in the uncontrolled environment of a test
laboratory. If it is not possible to maintain these parameters within
the specified limits, the actual values shall be recorded in the test
report.

G.3 Extreme test environment
============================

G.3.1 General
-------------

The manufacturer shall declare one of the following:

1\) the equipment class for the equipment under test, as defined in the
IEC 60721-3-3 \[21\] or ETSI EN 300 019-1-3 \[23\] (\"Stationary use at
weather protected locations\");

2\) the equipment class for the equipment under test, as defined in the
IEC 60721-3-4 \[22\] or ETSI EN 300 019-1-4 \[24\] (\"Stationary use at
non weather protected locations\");

3\) the equipment that does not comply to the mentioned classes, the
relevant classes from IEC 60721 \[20\] documentation for Temperature,
Humidity and Vibration shall be declared.

NOTE: Reduced functionality for conditions that fall outside of the
standard operational conditions are not tested in the present document.
These may be stated and tested separately.

G.3.2 Extreme temperature
-------------------------

When an extreme temperature test environment is specified for a test,
the test shall be performed at the standard minimum and maximum
operating temperatures defined by the manufacturer\'s declaration for
the equipment under test.

Minimum temperature:

The test shall be performed with the environment test equipment and
methods including the required environmental phenomena into the
equipment, conforming to the test procedure of IEC 60068-2-1 \[25\].

Maximum temperature:

The test shall be performed with the environmental test equipment and
methods including the required environmental phenomena into the
equipment, conforming to the test procedure of IEC 60068-2-2 \[26\].

NOTE: It is recommended that the equipment is made fully operational
prior to the equipment being taken to its lower operating temperature.

G.4 Vibration
=============

When vibration conditions are specified for a test, the test shall be
performed while the equipment is subjected to a vibration sequence as
defined by the manufacturer\'s declaration for the equipment under test.
This shall use the environmental test equipment and methods of inducing
the required environmental phenomena in to the equipment, conforming to
the test procedure of IEC 60068-2-6 \[27\]. Other environmental
conditions shall be within the ranges specified in annex G.2.

NOTE: The higher levels of vibration may induce undue physical stress in
to equipment after a prolonged series of tests. The testing body should
only vibrate the equipment during the RF measurement process.

G.5 Power supply
================

When extreme power supply conditions are specified for a test, the test
shall be performed at the standard upper and lower limits of operating
voltage defined by manufacturer\'s declaration for the equipment under
test.

Upper voltage limit:

The equipment shall be supplied with a voltage equal to the upper limit
declared by the manufacturer (as measured at the input terminals to the
equipment). The tests shall be carried out at the steady state minimum
and maximum temperature limits declared by the manufacturer for the
equipment, to the methods described in IEC 60068-2-1 \[25\] Test Ab/Ad
and IEC 60068-2-2 \[26\] Test Bb/Bd: Dry Heat.

Lower voltage limit:

The equipment shall be supplied with a voltage equal to the lower limit
declared by the manufacturer (as measured at the input terminals to the
equipment). The tests shall be carried out at the steady state minimum
and maximum temperature limits declared by the manufacturer for the
equipment, to the methods described in IEC 60068-2-1 \[25\] Test Ab/Ad
and IEC 60068-2-2 \[26\] Test Bb/Bd: Dry Heat.

G.6 Measurement of test environments
====================================

The measurement accuracy of the BS test environments shall be:

Pressure: ±5 kPa.

Temperature: ±2 degrees.

Relative Humidity: ±5 %.

DC Voltage: ±1,0 %.

AC Voltage: ±1,5 %.

Vibration: 10 %.

Vibration frequency: 0,1 Hz.

The above values shall apply unless the test environment is otherwise
controlled and the specification for the control of the test environment
specifies the uncertainty for the parameter.

G.7 OTA extreme test methods
============================

G.7.1 Direct far field method
-----------------------------

The AAS BS under test is placed inside a sealed RF transparent
environmental enclosure , as showed in Figure G.7.1-1. This is connected
to an environment control system which regulates the temperature inside
the enclosure. The remaining equipment inside the OTA chamber (any
suitable antenna test range chamber type is acceptable) is outside the
environmental control and is at nominal temperature. Positioners, test
antennas and all other OTA test equipment do not need to be specified
over the extreme temperature range.

![](media/image45.emf){width="6.697916666666667in" height="3.0in"}

Figure G.7.1-1: Measurement set up for Extreme conditions for EIRP
accuracy using direct far field method

The presence of the environmental chamber inside the OTA chamber may
affect the measurement accuracy due to additional reflections and
refractions, also the loss through the environmental enclosure may not
be consistent with direction as the path through the radome may vary
with angle. Hence the system should be calibrated in all tested
directions.

NOTE. Currently only a single direction is specified for extreme testing
so a single calibration direction is sufficient.

Conformance may be demonstrated by measuring the difference between the
nominal measurement and the extreme measurement (Δ~sample~) or by
measuring P~max,c,EIRP,\ extreme~ directly.

Measure EIRP for any two orthogonal polarizations (denoted p1 and p2)
and calculate total radiated transmit power for particular *beam
direction pair* as EIRP = EIRP~p1~ + EIRP~p2~.

G.7.2 Relative method
---------------------

The AAS BS under test is placed inside a small (compared to a far field
chamber) anechoic chamber which is both RF a screened and suitable for
environmental conditioning. The RF conditionals inside the chamber are
absorptive and capable of dissipating the power the AAS BS when
radiating. A sample antenna or RF probe are placed in a location which
gives a sample of the main beam EIRP but does not have to accurately
measure the EIRP directly, instead the near-field response is measured.
For this method test components are exposed to the full temperature
range for example the test antenna/probe, cables, absorbers etc. may
change as a function of temperature.

Using the relative method it is also necessary to measure the EIRP under
nominal conditions using an appropriately calibrated far field (or near
field) test range to obtain P~max,c,EIRP~.

![](media/image46.emf){width="5.125in" height="2.7291666666666665in"}

Figure F.7.2-1: Measurement set up for Extreme conditions for EIRP
accuracy using difference method

Measurements from the test antenna/ probe are taken under nominal
conditions and extreme conditions to calculate (Δ~sample~). The
difference between the nominal and extreme conditions (Δ~sample~) is
then used along with the nominal EIRP measurement (P~max,c,EIRP~) made
in the appropriate far field or near field chamber and compared against
the extreme requirement. As follows:

P~max,c,EIRP,\ extreme~ = P~max,c,EIRP~ + Δ~sample~.

Measure EIRP for any two orthogonal polarizations (denoted p1 and p2)
and calculate total radiated transmit power for particular *beam
direction pair* as EIRP = EIRP~p1~ + EIRP~p2~.

######## Annex H (informative): Measuring noise close to noise-floor

As the emission level seen by the measurement receiver (*P~UEM~*) for
co-location requirements are very low, it is suggested to measure
relative noise change instead of absolute noise level. The relations
between measured noise change *δ~1~*, noise floor N~0~ and the relation
to *P~UEM~* with respect to the noise floor denoted *δ~2~* is visualized
in Figure H-1.

![](media/image47.emf){width="2.75in" height="1.5104166666666667in"}
![](media/image48.png){width="2.8958333333333335in"
height="2.1770833333333335in"}

Figure H-1: Relative noise measurement

The absolute emission level in decibel scale is calculated as:

![](media/image49.wmf){width="1.0729166666666667in" height="0.25in"},
where *N~0~* is the noise floor of the measurement receiver and *δ~2~*
is plotted s function of *δ~1~* in Figure H-1. The absolute noise floor
of the measurement receiver, including probe antenna, cables, filter and
LNA is determined by a calibration procedure. The calibration will
determine the absolute emission level (*N~0~*) accuracy of measuring
out-of-band unwanted emission close to the thermal noise floor.
