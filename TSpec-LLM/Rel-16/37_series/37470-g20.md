Foreword
========

This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:

**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something

**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something

The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the
context of normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.

The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes
for \"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as
possible, and they are not used in a normative context except in a
direct citation from an external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so
as to maintain continuity of style when extending or modifying the
provisions of such a referenced document.

**should** indicates a recommendation to do something

**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something

**may** indicates permission to do something

**cannot** indicates that something is impossible

The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\"
and \"need not\".

**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a
result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to
happen as a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which
is outside the scope of the present document

**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result
of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document

**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

In addition:

**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement
of fact

**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates
a statement of fact

The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

1 Scope
=======

The present document is an introduction to the 3GPP TS 37.4xx series of
technical specifications that define the W1 interface. The W1 interface
provides means for interconnecting an ng-eNB-CU and an ng-eNB-DU of an
ng-eNB within an NG-RAN.

3 Definitions of terms, symbols and abbreviations
=================================================

3.1 Terms
---------

For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions
given in 3GPP TR 21.905 \[1\] and the following apply. A term defined in
the present document takes precedence over the definition of the same
term, if any, in 3GPP TR 21.905 \[1\].

**W1:** interface between an ng-eNB-CU and an ng- eNB-DU, providing an
interconnection point between the ng-eNB-CU and the ng-eNB-DU.

**W1-C**: Reference point for the control plane protocol between
ng-eNB-CU and ng-eNB-DU.

ng-**eNB-CU**: a logical node hosting RRC, SDAP and PDCP protocols of
the ng-eNB that controls the operation of one or more ng-eNB-DUs. The
ng-eNB-CU terminates the W1 interface connected with the ng-eNB-DU.

ng-**eNB-DU**: a logical node hosting RLC, MAC and PHY layers of the
ng-eNB, and its operation is partly controlled by ng-eNB-CU. One
ng-eNB-DU supports one or multiple cells. One cell is supported by only
one ng-eNB-DU. The ng-eNB-DU terminates the W1 interface connected with
the ng-eNB-CU.

ng-**eNB**: as defined in TS 38.300 \[3\].

4 General aspects
=================

4.0 General
-----------

This clause captures the W1 interface principles and characteristics.

4.1 W1 interface general principles
-----------------------------------

The general principles for the specification of the W1 interface are as
follows:

\- An ng-eNB may consist of an ng-eNB-CU and ng-eNB-DUs. An ng-eNB-CU
and an ng-eNB-DU is connected via W1 logical interface.

\- One ng-eNB-CU controls one or more ng-eNB-DUs.

\- One ng-eNB-DU supports one or multiple cells. One cell is supported
by only one ng-eNB-DU.

\- ng-eNB-DU ID is used to identify ng-eNB-DU only over W1AP procedures,
ng-eNB-DU ID is not connected to cell identifier.

\- The ng-eNB-CU terminates W1 interface connected with the ng-eNB-DU.

\- The ng-eNB-DU terminates W1 interface connected with the ng-eNB-CU.

\- The W1 interface shall separate Radio Network Layer and Transport
Network Layer.

\- The W1 interface shall enable exchange of UE associated information
and non-UE associated information.

\- The W1 interface is open;

\- From a logical standpoint, the W1 is a point-to-point interface
between an ng-eNB-CU and an ng-eNB-DU.

NOTE: A point-to-point logical interface should be feasible even in the
absence of a physical direct connection between the endpoints.

\- The W1 interface supports control plane and user plane separation;

\- The W1 interface enables exchange of UE associated information and
non-UE associated information;

\- The standard should not prevent to separated CP and UP.

4.2 W1 interface specification objectives
-----------------------------------------

The W1 interface specifications facilitate the following:

\- inter-connection of an ng-eNB-CU and an ng-eNB-DU supplied by
different manufacturers.

4.3 W1 interface capabilities
-----------------------------

The W1 interface supports:

\- procedures to establish, maintain and release radio bearers for the
NG-RAN part of PDU sessions and for E-UTRAN Radio Access Bearers;

\- the separation of each UE on the protocol level for user specific
signalling management;

\- the transfer of RRC signalling messages between the UE and the
ng-eNB-CU.

4.4 W1 interface characteristics
--------------------------------

5 Functions of the W1 interface
===============================

5.1 General
-----------

The following clauses describe the functions supported over W1-C and
W1-U.

5.2 W1-C functions
------------------

### 5.2.1 Interface management function

The W1 setup function allows to exchange application level data needed
for the ng-eNB-DU and ng-eNB-CU to interoperate correctly on the W1
interface. The W1 setup is initiated by the ng-eNB-DU.

The ng-eNB-CU Configuration Update and ng-eNB-DU Configuration Update
functions allow to update application level configuration data needed
between ng-eNB-CU and ng-eNB-DU to interoperate correctly over the W1
interface, and may activate or deactivate cells.

For NG-RAN, the W1 setup and ng-eNB-DU Configuration Update functions
allow to inform the S-NSSAI(s) supported by the ng-eNB-DU.

The error indication function is used by the ng-eNB-DU or ng-eNB-CU to
indicate to the ng-eNB-CU or ng-eNB-DU that an error has occurred.

The reset function is used to initialize the peer entity after node
setup and after a failure event occurred. This procedure can be used by
both the ng-eNB-DU and the ng-eNB-CU.

The W1 resource coordination function is used to transfer information
about frequency resource sharing between ng-eNB-CU and ng-eNB-DU.

The ng-eNB-DU status indication function allows the ng-eNB-DU to
indicate overload status to ng-eNB-CU.

### 5.2.2 System Information management function

Scheduling of system broadcast information is carried out in the
ng-eNB-DU. The ng-eNB-DU is responsible for transmitting the system
information according to the scheduling parameters available.

The ng-eNB-DU is responsible for the encoding of ng-eNB-MIB. In case
broadcast of SIB1 and other SI messages is needed, the ng-eNB-DU is
responsible for assembling SIB1, SIB2, SIB3, SIB8 and SIB16 and the
ng-eNB-CU is responsible for assembling other SIBs.

### 5.2.3 Paging function 

The ng-eNB-DU is responsible for transmitting the paging information.

The ng-eNB-CU provides paging information to enable the ng-eNB-DU to
calculate the exact PO and PF. The ng-eNB-CU determines the PA. The
ng-eNB-DU consolidates all the paging records for a particular PO, PF
and PA, and encodes the final RRC message and broadcasts the paging
message on the respective PO, PF in the PA.

### 5.2.4 UE context management function

The W1 UE context management function supports the establishment and
modification of the necessary overall UE context.

The establishment of the W1 UE context is initiated by the ng-eNB-CU and
accepted or rejected by the ng-eNB-DU based on admission control
criteria (e.g., resource not available).

The modification of the W1 UE context can be initiated by either
ng-eNB-CU or ng-eNB-DU. The receiving node can accept or reject the
modification. The W1 UE context management function also supports the
release of the context previously established in the ng-eNB-DU. The
release of the context is triggered by the ng-eNB-CU either directly or
following a request received from the ng-eNB-DU. The ng-eNB-CU requests
the ng-eNB-DU to remove the UE Context when the UE enters RRC\_IDLE or
RRC\_INACTIVE.

This function can be also used to manage DRBs and SRBs, i.e.,
establishing, modifying and releasing DRB and SRB resources. The
establishment and modification of DRB resources are triggered by the
ng-eNB-CU and accepted/rejected by the ng-eNB-DU based on resource
reservation information and QoS information to be provided to the
ng-eNB-DU. For each DRB to be setup or modified, the S-NSSAI may be
provided by ng-eNB-CU to the ng-eNB-DU in the UE Context Setup procedure
and the UE Context Modification procedure.

For NG-RAN, the mapping between QoS flows and radio bearers is performed
by ng-eNB-CU and the granularity of bearer related management over W1 is
radio bearer level, and the ng-eNB-CU decides an aggregated DRB QoS
profile for each radio bearer based on received QoS flow profile, and
provides both aggregated DRB QoS profile and QoS flow profile to the
ng-eNB-DU, and the ng-eNB-DU either accepts the request or rejects it
with appropriate cause value.

With this function, ng-eNB-DU could also notify ng-eNB-CU whether the
QoS for already established DRBs is not fulfilled any longer or it is
fulfilled again.

The UE Inactivity Notification function is initiated by the ng-eNB-DU to
indicate the UE activity event.

The Notify function is to enable the ng-eNB-DU to inform the ng-eNB-CU
that the QoS of an already established GBR DRB cannot by fulfilled any
longer or that it can be fulfilled again.

With this function, the ng-eNB-CU indicates the UL UE AMBR limit to the
ng-eNB-DU, and the ng-eNB-DU enforces the indicated limit.

With this function, the ng-eNB-CU indicates the UL UE AMBR limit to the
ng-eNB-DU, and the ng-eNB-DU enforces the indicated limit.

With this function, ng-eNB-CU requests the ng-eNB-DU to setup or change
of the SpCell for the UE, and the ng-eNB-DU either accepts or rejects
the request with appropriate cause value.

With this function, the ng-eNB-CU requests the setup of the SCell(s) at
the ng-eNB-DU side, and the ng-eNB-DU accepts all, some or none of the
SCell(s) and replies to the ng-eNB-CU. The ng-eNB-CU requests the
removal of the SCell(s) for the UE.

With this function, the ng-eNB-DU indicates that a bearer, or a UE is
inactive or active. The ng-eNB-CU consolidates all the serving
ng-eNB-DUs for the UE and takes further action.

### 5.2.5 RRC message transfer function

This function allows to transfer RRC messages between ng-eNB-CU and
ng-eNB-DU. RRC messages are transferred over W1-C. The ng-eNB-CU is
responsible for the encoding of the dedicated RRC message with
assistance information provided by ng-eNB-DU. This function also allows
ng-eNB-DU to report to ng-eNB-CU if the downlink RRC message has been
successfully delivered to UE or not.

### 5.2.6 Warning messages information transfer function

This function allows to cooperate with the warning message transmission
procedures over NG interface. The ng-eNB-CU is responsible for encoding
the warning related SI message and sending it together with other
warning related information for the ng-eNB-DU to broadcast over the
radio interface.

5.3 W1-U functions
------------------

### 5.3.1 Transfer of user data 

This function allows to transfer of user data between ng-eNB-CU and
ng-eNB-DU.

### 5.3.2 Flow control function 

This function allows to control the downlink user data flow to the
ng-eNB-DU. The detailed protocol is specified in TS 38.425 \[2\]
