 1 Scope
=======

The present document is the technical report for the work item on MIMO
OTA, which was approved at TSG RAN\#55 \[13\]. The scope of the WI is to
define a 3GPP methodology or set of comparable methodologies for
measuring the radiated performance of multiple antenna reception and
MIMO receivers in the UE. The test methodology should be relevant for
HSPA and LTE technologies, with particular focus on handheld devices and
devices embedded in laptop computers.

RAN WG4 has been working on the study item \"Measurement of radiated
performance for MIMO and multi-antenna reception for HSPA and LTE
terminals\" with the objective to define a test methodology for
measuring the radiated performance of MIMO and multi-antenna UE
reception in UMTS and LTE.

RAN4 has done sufficient work to be confident that the definition of a
meaningful test methodology is feasible; however RAN4 does not have
sufficient evidence yet to conclude on a single test methodology that
would fulfil all requirements for standardisation, and the
standardisation of multiple test methodologies may be one eventual
outcome, with a view to avoid differences in the decision of what is a
\"good\" or \"bad\" device from the radiated receiver performance
perspective.

4 Introduction
==============

4.1 Background
--------------

The use of MIMO and receiver diversity in the UE is expected to give
large gains in downlink throughput performance for HSPA and LTE devices.
3GPP already defined conducted tests for MIMO and multiple antenna
receivers (type 1 and type 3 in TS 25.101 for HSPA demodulation), but it
is clear that the ability to duplicate these gains in the field is
highly dependent on the performance of the receive-antenna system.

At TSG RAN\#41, Sep 2008, it was indicated that there is a need for a
test methodology to be created with the aim of measuring and verifying
the radiated performance of multi-antenna and MIMO receiver in UEs for
both HSPA and LTE devices. As an outcome of the discussion, an LS was
sent to COST 2100 SWG2.2 and CTIA ERP to ask them for feedback on their
plans/ongoing work in this area, and also the timescales for which such
work could be completed to define such a methodology, with particular
focus on handheld devices and devices embedded in laptop computers.

Since then, feedback from COST 2100 and CTIA has suggested they are
happy to work on this topic. However, given that 3GPP is the customer
for this work as well as being a potential contributor, it is important
to aim for commonly-accepted measurement and test methodology to be used
across the industry.

4.2 Work item objective
-----------------------

The high level objective of this work item is to define a test
methodology (ies) for verifying the radiated performance of multiple
antenna reception in the UE and such methodology shall be able to:

\- Verify the radiated \"Over-The-Air\" (OTA) performance of multiple
antenna reception in the UE.

\- Accurately able to reflect MIMO and SIMO performance under realistic
MIMO and SIMO channel conditions. Be able to distinguish between UEs of
\"Good\" and \"Bad\" multi-Rx antenna OTA performance, and offer a good
reflection of the likely experience in the field.

\- Offer good reliability, repeatability and an acceptable level of
measurement uncertainty.

Such test methodology(ies) shall enable performance verification for:

\- Handheld devices, devices embedded in laptop computers, and other
devices (such as M2M equipment).

\- All transmission modes of LTE and HSDPA, including spatial
multiplexing (MIMO) and single spatial layer operation. However the
transmission modes used in the test shall be defined as part of the
work.

\- Initially tests shall use of LTE Transmission Mode 3, Fixed Reference
Channel, and forced Rank 2. As the work progresses, other transmission
modes of LTE and HSPA shall be introduced.

\- The utilization of Variable Reference Channels and other-cell
interference shall also be studied at a later stage.

The following is required for the analysis phase of this work item:

\- In order to compare results across the different methods, absolute
throughput shall be used as the Figure of Merit.

\- In order to analyse and accurately validate a method(s) the following
work shall be performed:

\- eNodeB settings shall be agreed.

\- Realistic MIMO conditions and realistic channel models shall be
identified to be used as a reference radio environment.

\- The MIMO conditions and channel models shall be validated for the
proposed test methods.

\- Calibration of the power levels in the methodology shall be
performed.

\- The absolute throughput measured for each test method shall be
compared with the absolute throughput measured in the reference radio
environment, in order to identify the capability of each method to
provide a measurement result that matches what is observed in realistic
environments.

\- In order to minimize the variables associated with testing of
production UEs with unknown antenna characteristics, utilize reference
antennas in combination with a known UE baseband receiver (verified via
conducted RF tests with and without channel impairments). This is
intended to verify whether the characteristics of the receive antenna
design (i.e. correlation, gain imbalance, etc) affecting receiver
performance can be accurately distinguished by proposed test methods.

In the event that more than one test methodology is agreed to be
standardised, differences between methodologies in the decision of what
is a \"good\" or \"bad\" device from the radiated receiver performance
perspective shall be avoided.

When selecting the method(s) for specification for LTE MIMO,
applicability to LTE-SIMO UMTS-SIMO/MIMO shall be described.

During the course of this Work Item, maintain ongoing communication with
COST and CTIA MOSG to ensure industry coordination on this topic and to
distribute tasks according to expertise or resource availability.

TSG RAN should contact TSG GERAN to get feedback on the applicability of
such a test methodology for GERAN.

4.3 High level requirements
---------------------------

The following high level requirements are agreed by RAN4:

1\. Measurement of radiated performance for MIMO and multi-antenna
reception for HSPA and LTE terminals must be performed over-the-air,
i.e. without RF cable connections to the DUT.

> NOTE 1: DUTs to the test house will have accessibility to temporary
> antenna port for conducted purposes.
>
> NOTE 2: Temporary antenna port is used to assess to DUT receiver.
>
> NOTE 3: UE special function to measure antenna pattern is not
> desirable for MIMO OTA purposes.

2\. The MIMO OTA method(s) must be able to differentiate between a good
terminal and a bad terminal in terms of MIMO OTA performance.

3\. The desired primary Figure Of Merit (FOM) is absolute throughput.
This will easily allow meaningful comparison of the ability of different
methods to evaluate MIMO OTA performance.

5 Performance metrics
=====================

5.1 Figure of Merits
--------------------

Absolute throughput performance is used in order to be able to compare
the different proposed methodologies in their ability to distinguish
good and bad MIMO devices.

The performance metric applies to both HSPA and LTE system.

Other Figure of Merits and their applicability on the assessment of MIMO
performance is for further study.

### 5.1.1 Definition of MIMO throughput

MIMO throughput is defined here as the time-averaged number of correctly
received transport blocks in a communication system running an
application, where a Transport Block is defined in the reference
measurement channel. From OTA perspective, this is also called MIMO OTA
throughput.

The MIMO OTA throughput is measured at the top of physical layer of HSPA
and LTE system. Therefore, this is also measured at the same point as in
the conductive measurement setup: under the use of FRC, the SS transmit
fixed-size payload bits to the DUT. The DUT signals back either ACK or
NACK to the SS. The SS then records the following:

 Number of ACKs,

 Number of NACKs, and

 Number of DTX TTIs

Hence the MIMO (OTA) throughput can be calculated as

where Transmitted TBS is the Transport Block Size transmitted by the SS,
which is fixed for a FRC during the measurement period. MeasurementTime
is the total composed of successful TTIs (ACK), unsuccessful TTIs (NACK)
and DTX-TTIs.

The time-averaging is to be taken over a time period sufficiently long
to average out the variations due to the fading channel. Therefore, this
is also called the average MIMO OTA throughput. The throughput should be
measured at a time when eventual start-up transients in the system have
evanesced.

### 5.1.2 Definition of Signal-to-Interference Ratio (SIR)

Applicability of SIR to MIMO OTA performance evaluation is FFS.

This definition is applicable to MIMO OTA test cases where control of
the signal to interference ratio (SIR) is required (i.e. DUT throughput
characterized as a function of SIR shall require control of SIR within
the test volume as described in the sub-sections that follow). For test
cases where SIR control is not required (i.e. throughput characterized
as a function of signal power incident to the DUT antennas, such as RS
EPRE) this definition is not applicable.

In real world scenarios the mobile will experience an interference floor
higher than the device noise floor. As a consequence, the methodology
for quantifying MIMO OTA performance of a device may have to include the
use of an external interferer signal. MIMO OTA testing is useful for a
situation where, in general, a high signal level is received that is not
close to the sensitivity level of the UE and the interference floor is
dominated by inter-cell interference and/or other interferers and not
the UE noise floor. In most UE performance testing, interference is
modelled as AWGN for conducted testing. This proposal intends to align
with this assumption and use AWGN for the interference signal.

From a system level point of view, the omnidirectional (isotropic) and
uncorrelated nature of the interfering signal to the wanted signal is a
crucial assumption. Injecting a noise signal that is correlated to the
wanted faded signal is neither a scenario that is typically found in the
network nor a scenario for which the UE modem is designed. As a result,
we propose the methodology for injecting an omnidirectional (isotropic)
and uncorrelated interferer signal.

#### 5.1.2.1 SIR Control for Multi-Probe Anechoic Chamber Methodology

The interference level necessary to achieve a given SIR inside the test
zone shall be generated as an independent process at each antenna probe
with equal power, regardless of the signal power transmitted through
that probe. The SIR shall be decreased by increasing the AWGN power
while keeping the signal level constant.

To validate the control of SIR, the measurement setup shown in Figure
5.1.2.1-1 below may be used.

![](media/image4.emf)

multi-cluster MIMO OTA setup

The actual system components shown in the diagram, such as amplifier box
or the source of the omnidirectional interferer signal, may or may not
be present as shown.

The procedure below shall be used to verify SIR control inside the test
zone for a given target SIR.

Verification procedure for establishing SIR control:

1\. Configure the spectrum analyser with the settings given in Table
5.1.2.1-1 below

2\. Load the target channel model into the channel emulator (e.g. SCME
UMa, SCME UMi) and start the emulation

3\. Configure the system gains for the LTE signal and injected
interfering signal paths to achieve the target SIR

4\. Disable interfering signal injection (depending on the system
configuration this may be configured within the channel emulator itself
or in an external signal generator)

5\. Connect a vertically polarized reference dipole to the spectrum
analyser via a cable and place inside the chamber at the center of the
test zone

6\. Measure the received power with the spectrum analyser over a
duration sufficient to achieve statistical significance as defined in
clause 12.1.6.2 and record the value as

P~SIG\_MEAS\_VER~

7\. Compensate for the loss of the cable (α~CABLE~) and the gain of the
dipole (G~DIPOLE~) such that

P~SIG\_\ VER~ = P~SIG\_MEAS\_VER~ - α~CABLE~ -- G~DIPOLE~

8\. Repeat steps 5 to 7 with the magnetic loop and get

P~SIG\_\ HOR~ = P~SIG\_MEAS\_HOR~ - α~CABLE~ -- G~LOOP~

9\. Calculate the total signal power received as

P~SIG\_TOTAL~ = P~SIG\_VER\|LINEAR~ + P~SIG\_HOR\|LINEAR~

10\. Disable the LTE signal source and enable interference injection
(depending on the system configuration this may be configured within the
channel emulator itself or in an external signal generator)

11\. Connect a reference dipole to the spectrum analyser via a cable and
place inside the chamber at the center of the test zone

12\. Measure the received interfering signal power with the spectrum
analyser over aduration sufficient to achieve statistical significance
and record the value as

P~INT\_MEAS\_VER~

13\. Compensate for the loss of the cable (α~CABLE~) and the gain of the
dipole (G~DIPOLE~) such that

P~INT\_\ VER~ = P~INT\_MEAS\_VER~ - α~CABLE~ -- G~DIPOLE~

14\. Repeat steps 11 to 13 with the magnetic loop and get

P~INT\_\ HOR~ = P~INT\_MEAS\_HOR~ - α~CABLE~ - G~LOOP~

15\. Calculate the total interfering signal power received as

P~INT\_TOTAL~ = P~INT\_VER\|LINEAR~ + P~INT\_HOR\|LINEAR~

16\. Calculate the achieved signal to interference ratio such that

SIR~ACHIEVED~ = P~SIG\_TOTAL~ - P~INT\_TOTAL~

and validate that it matches the target SIR.

Care shall be taken to ensure that the signal level measurement in step
6 and the interfering signal level measurement in step 12 are
sufficiently above the noise floor of the measurement system as to not
impact the final SIR level. A horizontally polarized reference dipole
may be used as opposed to the magnetic loop as long as the theta gain
pattern is properly accounted for.

#### 5.1.2.2 SIR Control for the reverberation chamber method

Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) is used as interference for the
SIR-controlled test case. Figure 5.1.2.2-1 shows an example setup for
adding AWGN to the test environment with the injection point for the
AWGN highlighted. The AWGN noise power used to create the desired SIR
within the test volume shall be generated as an independent process. It
is represented by faded noise driven in an isotropic fashion. The AWGN
is injected into the reverberation chamber using a separate chamber
antenna and the fading of the signal and the noise will be uncorrelated.
The SIR is computed as a long-term average.

![](media/image5.emf)

Figure 5.1.2.2-1: Example setup for SIR-controlled test scenario for the
reverberation chamber methodology

#### 5.1.2.3 SIR Control for the reverberation chamber plus channel emulator method

AWGN will be used as interference for the SIR-controlled test case.
Figure 5.1.2.3-1 shows an example setup for adding AWGN to the test
environment with the injection points for the AWGN highlighted. The AWGN
noise power used to create the desired SIR within the test volume shall
be generated as an independent process with equal power at each output
of the channel emulator. It is represented by an un-faded noise driven
in an isotropic fashion. The AWGN is combined with the signal at the
output of the channel emulator (after the channel emulator fading) but
before the signal is fed to the reverberation chamber antennas. The
combined signal and AWGN is then fed into the chamber with the same
chamber antennas. The SIR is computed as a long-term average.

![](media/image6.emf)

Figure 5.1.2.3-1: Example setup for SIR-controlled test scenario for the
reverberation chamber and channel emulator methodology

#### 5.1.2.4 SIR Control for the two-stage methodology

The two-stage method is fundamentally different from the multi-probe
boundary array method and this has a significant impact on how
omnidirectional AWGN is generated and validated.

In the two-stage method the AWGN is added digitally to the baseband
signals. The goal is to emulate omnidirectional AWGN at the UE antennas.
Since the signals generated by the second stage of two-stage method
represent the signals after applying the effect of the receive antennas
this has implications for the addition of AWGN.

If uncorrelated AWGN is added to the second stage signals for each UE
receiver this creates a slightly easier test environment where each
receiver sees uncorrelated noise. However, when the UE is placed in an
actual omnidirectional noise field, the noise reaching each of the
recovers is correlated by the same amount as the antennas are
correlated. The impact of using uncorrelated AWGN depends on the
antennas in question. Highly correlated antennas would see the same AWGN
signal at each receiver but very low correlated antennas would expect
see uncorrelated AWGN which is easier to process. For typical devices
the performance difference has been measured at around 0.5 dB.

To fully represent the impact of omnidirectional AWGN on the wanted
signals being generated for each receiver after the antennas, it is
therefore necessary to correlate the AWGN according to the antenna
correlation for an isotropic field.

To validate the control of SIR, the measurement setup shown in Figure
5.1.2.4-1 below may be used.

![](media/image7.png)

Figure 5.1.2.4-1: Verifying SIR level for the RTS method

Note: The signals from the vertical polarization and horizontal
polarization have a different meaning from the multi-probe method. For
the multi-probe method, the signal from vertical polarization antenna
represents the vertical polarized signal in the real propagation
environment. But for RTS method, the signal from the vertical
polarization antenna represents the signal intended for one receiver,
which has had the dual-polarized channel environment and antenna pattern
applied. The same is true for the horizontal antenna. Thus the signals
from each probe antenna include AWGN components from both polarizations.

The actual system components shown in the diagram are indicative of
functions and may or may not be integrated.

The procedure below shall be used to verify SIR control for a given
target SIR.

1\. Configure the spectrum analyzer with the settings given in Table
5.1.2.4-1 below

2\. Load the target channel model into the channel emulator (e.g. SCME
UMa, SCME UMi) and start the emulation

3\. Configure the system gains for the LTE signals and interfering
signal to achieve the target SIR

4\. Disable the interfering signal

5\. Connect a vertically polarized reference dipole to the spectrum
analyzer via a cable and place inside the chamber at the center of the
test zone

6\. Measure the received power with the spectrum analyzer over a
duration sufficient to achieve statistical significance as defined in
clause 12.3.6.2 and record the value as

P~SIG\_MEAS\_VER~

7\. Compensate for the loss of the cable (α~CABLE~) and the gain of the
dipole (G~DIPOLE~) such that

P~SIG\_\ VER~ = P~SIG\_MEAS\_VER~ - α~CABLE~ -- G~DIPOLE~

8\. Repeat steps 5 to 7 with the magnetic loop and get

P~SIG\_\ HOR~ = P~SIG\_MEAS\_HOR~ - α~CABLE~ -- G~LOOP~

9\. Disable the LTE signal source and enable interference injection
(depending on the system configuration this may be configured within the
channel emulator itself or in an external signal generator)

10\. Connect a reference dipole to the spectrum analyzer via a cable and
place inside the chamber at the center of the test zone

11\. Measure the received interfering signal power with the spectrum
analyzer over a duration sufficient to achieve statistical significance
and record the value as

12\. Compensate for the loss of the cable (α~CABLE~) and the gain of the
dipole (G~DIPOLE~) such that

P~INT\_\ VER~ = P~INT\_MEAS\_VER~ - α~CABLE~ -- G~DIPOLE~

13\. Repeat steps 10 to 12 with the magnetic loop and get

P~INT\_\ HOR~ = P~INT\_MEAS\_HOR~ - α~CABLE~ - G~LOOP~

14\. Calculate the achieved signal to interference ratio for vertical
polarization branch as

SIR~ACHIEVED\_VER~ = P~SIG\_\ VER~ - P~INT\_\ VER~

Calculate the achieved signal to interference ratio for horizontal
polarization branch as

SIR~ACHIEVED\_HOR~ = P~SIG\_\ HOR~ - P~INT\_\ HOR~

and validate that SIR~ACHIEVED\_VER~ and SIR~ACHIEVED\_HOR~ matches the
target SIR.

sufficiently above the noise floor of the measurement system as to not
impact the final SIR level. A horizontally polarized reference dipole
may be used as opposed to the magnetic loop as long as the theta gain
pattern is properly accounted for.

5.2 Averaging of throughput curves
----------------------------------

There are different possibilities how to average the curves where
throughput (TP) was recorded as function of downlink (DL) power
(expressed in RS EPRE) or of Signal-to-Interference (SIR) level.
Averages shall be calculated by the following formula.

### 5.2.1 Average of power levels

The averaging of DL power (or SIR) is the first possibility. The power
levels are summed similar to the formula used for TIS evaluation, i.e.
using the inverse of power. The formula to use is:

For every selected TP value *y* a corresponding power level *P~n~*(*y*)
can be found, and summed over all *N* conditions.\
The subscript \"*inv*\" is used to indicate that the inverse sum of
power values is taken.

The power levels have to be converted to linear values in mW before the
summation takes place, and the average then can be reconverted to dBm /
15 kHz for RS EPRE or dB for SIR.

Since the recording of the TP curves is done with fixed steps in power,
only few TP values are available.\
In order to calculate the correct average, the TP curves have to be
interpolated, and a fixed set of *y* values for TP can be used for
generating the curve of *P~avg~*(*y*).

In the case that a curve was not recorded down to 0 % TP, it shall be
extrapolated from the point taken with lowest TP to TP = 0 using the
same power level.

If a curve did not reach nominal TP, it shall be extrapolated it in a
way that it would reach nominal TP at the lowest power level where it
was reaching its individual maximum TP value.

The average TP curve shall only be calculated up to a TP value which
equals to the average of all individual maximum TP values.

### 6.3.1 Methodologies based on Anechoic RF Chamber

An OTA method based on the use of an Anechoic RF Chamber is described
consisting of a number of test antenna probes located in the chamber
transmitting signals with temporal and spatial characteristics for
testing multiple antenna devices.

This clause describes the methodologies based on Anechoic RF Chamber,
where a number of test antennas are located in different positions of
the chamber, and the Device Under Test (DUT) is located at center
position. The DUT is tested over the air without RF cables.

#### 6.3.1.1 Candidate Solution 1

An OTA method based on the use of an Anechoic RF Chamber is described
consisting of a number of test antennas located in the chamber
transmitting signals with temporal and spatial characteristics for
testing multiple antenna devices. The method consists of a number of
test antennas located in different positions of the chamber, and the
device under test (DUT) is located at the center position. The DUT is
tested over the air without RF cables.

The Anechoic chamber techniques creates a realistic geometric based
spatio-temporal-polarimetric radio channel for testing MIMO performance
using Geometric based stochastic channel models as defined in Clause
8.2.

The components of the solution include:

\- Anechoic Chamber

\- System Simulator (SS)

\- N channel RF emulator, with OTA Channel Generation Features

\- N linearly polarized antenna elements configured V, H or co-located
V&H or slant X polarizations

\- K azimuthally separated antenna positions with predefined angles at
radius R

\- Channel model definition for each test case

An illustration of an anechoic chamber is shown in Figure 6.3.1.1-1
below.

A system level block diagram is shown in Figure 6.3.1.1-2, which

The full SCME or Multi-Cluster channel models are defined in Clause 8.2.
The Single-Cluster model, which is not part of the set of channel models
validated in clause 8, would be based on the channel models defined in
section 8.2 with a set of dithered AoAs around zero degrees.

##### 6.3.1.1.1 Concept and configuration

For MIMO OTA modelling the geometric channel models are mapped into the
fading emulator, converting the geometric channel models into the
emulator tap coefficients. This process is illustrated in Figure
6.3.1.1.1-1.

Figure 6.3.1.1.1-1: Modelling process

The setup of OTA chamber antennas with eight antenna positions is
depicted in Figure 6.3.1.1.1-2. The DUT is at the center, and the
antennas are in a circle around the DUT with uniform spacing (e.g. 45°
with 16 elements arranged in 8 positions, where each position contains a
vertically and horizontally polarized antenna pair). Denoting directions
of *K* OTA antennas with *θ~k~*, *k* = 1, ..., *K*, and antenna spacing
in the angle domain with *∆θ*. Each antenna is connected to a single
fading emulator output port. In the figure, for example, antenna A~1V~
denotes the first OTA antenna position and Vertically (V) polarized
element, A~8H~ denotes the eight OTA antenna position and horizontally
(H) polarized element, etc.

![](media/image12.emf)

NOTE: In the drawing the V-polarized elements are actually orthogonal to
the paper (azimuth plane)

Figure 6.3.1.1.1-2: OTA chamber antenna setup with eight uniformly
spaced dual polarized chamber antennas

##### 6.3.1.1.2 Scalability of the methodology

The number of antennas is scalable. In theory, there is no upper limit
and the lower limit is one. The required number of channels depends on
three main aspects: channel model, DUT size, and polarization. The key
question is how accurately the channel model is emulated. Based on the
quiet zone discussion, it was proposed to use 8 antennas in the case of
single polarization and 16 antennas in the case of dual polarization.
However, for single cluster case, fewer antennas may be enough. On the
other hand, if elevation is needed, the antenna number will be higher.
Additionally, the antenna positions can be adjusted to optimize the
accuracy with limited number of antennas.

Another aspect is the channel model. Most of the Geometry-based
Stochastic Channel Models (GSCMs) are two-dimensional, i.e. azimuth
plane only, but the proposed MIMO OTA concept is not limited to the
azimuth plane.\
It can also be extended to elevation plane, when we talk about 3D MIMO
OTA. However, the 3D MIMO OTA is rather complex and it does not provide
very much additional information about the DUT. Therefore, 3D MIMO OTA
can be considered as one future development, but it is not the
recommended solution in the beginning of MIMO OTA testing.

Downscaling of the proposed method is more attractive due to the
possibility to save the cost of the test system.\
Full SCME requires multiple antennas, but single cluster SCME can be
implemented with lower number of antennas than full SCME. The same
downscaling benefits of the single-cluster model apply based on DUT
size. The difference between full SCME and Single Cluster model is
depicted in Figure 6.3.1.1.2-1. Basically the only difference is that
the mean Angle-of-Arrival (AoA) of each cluster is turned to the same
primary direction. If all AoA's were identical, it would be a
problematic case as it locks all like-angle sub-paths together with
identical Doppler, which results in a breakdown of the model. With
slight dithering as in the example that the AoAs = \[0 -1 1 -2 2 -3\]
degrees, the angle spread after dithering increases from 35.00 to 35.02
degrees, which is not significant, however the model now performs as
expected. Obviously, one primary cluster requires a lower number of
antennas than multiple clusters especially when angular spread is
narrow, e.g. 35 degrees. The number of fading channels is the same as
the number of antennas.\
Therefore, single cluster SCME would require less fading channels as
well.

##### 6.3.1.1.3 Test conditions

This candidate solution supports testing of different figure of merits
and is applicable to any 3GPP release.\
It supports different channel models from SCM to IMT-Advanced. Due to
its generality, it does not restrict the test conditions. However, for
simplicity, it is good to start from downlink throughput testing.

The downlink throughput testing can be done e.g. in the following
manner.

BS transmits signal through a radio channel emulator. This signal is
routed to several antennas in anechoic chamber. The DUT is placed at
center of the chamber and the performance is measured from the DUT.

\- OTA antennas are located along a circle around the DUT;

\- The circular geometry is needed because we need signal from many
directions at the same time (requirement from the channel models).

The test steps can be, e.g., according to \[3\] or as follows:

1\) Calibrate the full system with a test signal;

2\) Set the first test case (e.g. channel model) to the fading emulator;

3\) Generate test signal by the communication tester / BS emulator;

4\) Measure the DUT performance (downlink throughput);

5\) If the performance exceeds the specified limit, the DUT passes the

6\) If all test cases done, go to step 7. Otherwise, set the next test

test;

8\) If DUT failed in at least one test case, the DUT failed the full
MIMO OTA test.

#### 6.3.1.2 Void

#### 6.3.1.3 Candidate solution 3

The principle of two-stage MIMO OTA method is based on the assumption
that the DUT far-field antenna radiation pattern will contain all the
necessary information for evaluation of the DUT\'s antenna\'s
performance like radiation power, efficiency and correlation and that
with channel model approaches, the influence of antenna radiation
pattern can be correctly incorporated into the channel model. Thus the
method will first measure the DUT\'s MIMO antenna patterns and then
convolve the measured antenna patterns with the chosen MIMO OTA channel
models for real-time emulation. The resulting test signal generated by
the channel emulator and coupled back into the DUT receivers represents
the signal that the DUT receivers would have seen if the DUT had been
placed in the desired radiated field. Thus an ideal implementation of
the two-stage method provides the same results as an ideal
implementation of the boundary antenna array method.

The two-stage method can be used to measure the following figures of
merit:

1\) Throughput

2\) TRP and TRS

3\) CQI, BLER

4\) Antenna efficiency and MEG

5\) Antenna correlation, MIMO channel capacity.

In order to accurately measure the antenna pattern of the intact device,
the DUT chipset needs to support received amplitude and relative phase
measurements of the antennas. The validity of antenna pattern
measurement is predicated on the assumption that for the frequency being
tested, the DUT antenna pattern is static. Devices than can alter their
antenna pattern in real time as a function of the radiated environment
-- sometimes referred to as active antennas -- is FFS as noted in Table
12.4-1.The method of coupling the base station emulator and DUT can be
through the standard temporary antenna connectors (conducted two-stage
method) or by using a specially calibrated radiated connection (radiated
two-stage or RTS method) to do the test on throughput, etc., to test how
the MIMO antennas will influence the performance. The conducted method
of coupling is straightforward but does not capture the impact of
radiated leakage from the DUT transmit antennas to the DUT receive
antennas, thus in its current form without additional interference
estimation the conducted method of coupling in the second stage is not
proposed for use in conformance testing. Its description is included for
historical completeness of the development of the two-stage method. The
radiated method of coupling in the second stage does fully capture
radiated leakage and is the method defined for conformance testing in
Clause 12.

##### 6.3.1.3.1 Concept and configuration

The assumption of the two-stage MIMO OTA method is that the measured far
field antenna pattern of the DUT\'s multiple antennas can fully capture
the mutual coupling of the multiple antenna arrays and their influence
on radiated performance.\
Thus to do the two-stage MIMO OTA test, the antenna patterns of the
antenna array needs to be measured accurately in the first stage. In
order to accurately measure the antenna pattern of the intact device,
the chipset needs to support amplitude and relative phase measurements
of the antennas. To achieve this, two new UE measurements have been
defined called Reference Signal Antenna Power (RSAP) and Reference
Signal Relative Antenna Phase (RSARP). These measurements are defined in
TR 36.978 \[20\].

**Stage 1:** The measurement of the DUT's multiple antennas takes place
in a traditional anechoic chamber set up as described in Annex A.2 in
\[4\], where the DUT is put into the chamber and each antenna element\'s
complex far zone pattern is measured using the RSAP and RSARP
measurements defined in \[20\]. The influence of human body loss can
also be measured by attaching the DUT to a SAM head and or hand phantom
when doing the antenna pattern measurements. The characteristics of the
SAM phantom are specified in Annex A.1 of \[4\]. The chamber is equipped
with a positioner, that makes it possible to perform full 3-D far zone
pattern measurements for both Tx and Rx radiated performance. As
specified in A.2 of \[4\] the measurement antenna shall be able to
measure two orthogonal polarizations (typically linear theta (θ) and phi
(φ) polarizations as shown in Figure 6.3.1.3.1-1).

![](media/image15.emf)

Figure 6.3.1.3.1-1: The coordinate system used in the measurements

**Stage 2:** Convolve the antenna patterns measured in stage 1 with the
chosen MIMO channel model, using a channel emulator and then use the
resulting signal to perform the OTA throughput test. The signal is
coupled into the DUT using either a cabled or radiated connection.

The two-stage method is illustrated in Figure 6.3.1.3.1-2. In the
conducted two-stage method shown in Figure 6.3.1.3.1-2 the BS emulator
is connected to the MIMO channel emulator and then to the DUT's
temporary antenna ports via approved RF cables. These ports are the
standard ones provided for conducted conformance tests. The alternative
to using a conducted connection is to use a calibrated radiated
connection in an anechoic environment as shown in Figure 6.3.1.3.1-3 is
the radiated two-stage (RTS) method. This coupling technique exploits
the Eigen modes of the transmission channel in the anechoic chamber to
provide isolated radiated connections between the probe antennas and
each DUT receiver after the DUT antenna. Throughput with the DUT's MIMO
antenna influence can be measured using either coupling method. However,
only the radiated coupling method intrinsically includes the effects of
DUT self-interference and is the method defined for conformance testing
in Clause 12.

There are two different approaches to convolve the DUT antenna patterns
with MIMO channel model.

a\) Apply antenna patterns to geometric (Ray-based) channel models.
Ray-based models support arbitrary antenna patterns under predefined
channel modes in a natural way as described above. If Ray-based models
like SCME are specified to be used for MIMO OTA testing, then the
channel emulator needs to support SCME channel model emulation and
convolution with the measured antenna patterns.

b\) Apply antenna patterns to correlation-based channel models. With a
correlation matrix calculation method for arbitrary antenna patterns
under multipath channel conditions, the correlation matrix and the
antenna imbalance can be calculated and then emulated by the channel
emulator.

![](media/image16.jpeg)

Figure 6.3.1.3.1-2: Proposed conducted two-stage test methodology for
MIMO OTA test

An example implementation of the radiated method of connecting to the
EUT in the second stage is shown in Figure 6.3.1.3.1-3.

Figure 6.3.1.3.1-3: Alternative connection for the radiated two-stage
(RTS) test methodology for MIMO OTA test

Figure 6.3.1.3.1-3 shows the radiated coupling method for the second
stage. Two probe antennas with polarization V and H are co-located in
the anechoic chamber. Note, unlike in the first stage where the V and H
probes are used at different times, in the second stage both V and H
probes are used simultaneously. An example implementation of this would
be the dual polarized configuration described in Annex A.2.2 of \[4\].
The only difference between the conducted second stage and the radiated
second stage is to replace the RF cables with the radiated channel
inside the chamber. Due to the propagation channel in the chamber,
signals transmitted from each probe antenna are received by both DUT
antennas which is different from the cable conducted case where the
signals are isolated by the cables. However, by precoding the
transmitted signals using spatial multiplexing techniques it is possible
by calculating the radiated channel matrix and by applying its inverse
to the transmitted signals, to create an identity matrix allowing the
transmitted signals to be received independently at each DUT receiver
after the DUT antenna. This precoding recreates the equivalent of the
isolated cable conducted conditions at the receiver but but with
radiated self-interference now included.

The establishment of the radiated connection is explained as follows.
Assume
![](media/image18.png)![](media/image18.png)and![](media/image19.png)![](media/image19.png)
are the transmitted signals from the base station emulator, after
applying the desired channel model and convolution with the complex
antenna pattern we get:

![](media/image20.png)![](media/image20.png) and
![](media/image21.png)![](media/image21.png).

The radiated channel matrix between the probe antennas and the DUT
antennas is ![](media/image22.png)![](media/image22.png) .

If the channel emulator applies the inverse of the radiated channel
matrix ![](media/image23.png)![](media/image23.png) to
![](media/image20.png)![](media/image20.png) and
![](media/image21.png)![](media/image21.png), the signal received after
the DUT antennas is same as the cable-conducted method as follows:

![](media/image24.png)

The above example of RTS using two probe antennas is applicable to UE
with two Rx antennas. For UE with \> 2 Rx antennas, the RTS method is
FFS.

##### 6.3.1.3.2 Test conditions

This candidate solution supports testing of different figure of merits.
It is also applicable for any 3GPP Release, and even for other
standards.

This method can reuse existing SISO OTA anechoic chambers to make the
antenna pattern measurements; the channel emulator number is required to
match the number of device receiver inputs regardless of the complexity
of the chosen channel model, the method is consequently easily scalable
to higher order MIMO due to the reduced number of instruments required;
the channel models are highly accurate due to being implemented
electronically and are also fully flexible and can be altered to suit
any desired operating conditions such as indoor-outdoor, high or low
Doppler spread, high or low delay spread, beam width, in 2D or full 3D
etc.

This method requires the chipset in the DUT to support amplitude and
relative phase measurements of the antennas as defined in TR 36.978
\[20\]. The conducted coupling method in the second stage cannot
directly measure DUT self-desensitization since the antenna pattern
measurement does not take account of possible signal leakage from the
device transmit antennas into the receive antennas. The radiated
coupling method for the second stage does fully characterize any DUT
self-desensitization and is the method specified in Clause 12 for
conformance testing.

The detailed RTS test procedure can be found in Subclause 12.3.

##### 6.3.1.3.3 Overview of calibration procedures specific to the RTS method

The efficacy of the RTS method is based on the ability to accurately
measure the DUT complex antenna pattern and establish an isolated
radiated MIMO connection in the second stage.

The output of the first stage is a relative antenna pattern of unknown
gain and linearity. The calibration of the antenna pattern occurs in the
second stage.

**Selection of orientation for the second stage**

The second stage starts with the selection of a DUT orientation at which
to establish a radiated MIMO connection to the DUT. This orientation is
chosen from any point on the measured pattern at which the optimal
isolation between the streams can be achieved by application of the
inverse channel matrix. A degree of isolation between the received
streams for most antenna patterns is achieved through use of different
transmit polarizations or by using separate antennas. Improved isolation
will be achieved by choosing a DUT orientation that avoids nulls in the
antenna pattern. The algorithm for selecting the optimal orientation is
left up to implementation. The only criterion is that the selected
orientation achieves sufficient isolation.

**Calculation of the inverse transmission matrix**

Once an orientation is selected an unfaded SISO connection is
established from the first probe antenna and the RSAP for each DUT
antenna and the RSARP between the antennas is measured. These
measurements are repeated using the second probe antenna. From these
measurements the optimal transmission matrix from the probe antennas to
the DUT receiver can be calculated. When the inverse of this matrix is
applied to the probes it is possible to transmit a wanted signal from
the first probe to the first receiver and from the second probe to the
second receiver with minimal crosstalk.

**Calibration of the measured antenna pattern gain**

The impact of the unknown gain of the DUT antennas then de-embedded from
the test system by setting the downlink power for each probe to the
level that returns the same RSAP measurement that was reported for that
probe polarization during the first stage at the orientation being used
for the second stage. This nulling process is the reason why the
absolute accuracy of the RSAP measurement is unimportant since the
antenna gain is represented by the change in downlink power necessary to
achieve the same RSAP report for the first and second stage at the same
DUT orientation.

For example using a -60 dBm nominal level in the first stage for the V
antenna assume the DUT for one orientation returns RSAP for receiver 1
of -67 dBm representing an uncorrected gain of -7 dB. This report
includes the true gain of the antenna at the V polarization for this
orientation (assume -4 dB) plus an unknown error in the RSAP absolute
accuracy (-3 dB). In the second stage antenna calibration step, a wanted
signal of -60 dBm is transmitted, adjusted to -53 dBm to de-embed the
uncorrected gain of -7 dB and the RSAP measured. If the RSAP accuracy
were perfect the DUT would report -60 dBm but since the true antenna
gain at that orientation is -4 dB, the reported RSAP is higher at -57
dBm. The difference between the first stage RSAP measurement and the
second stage RSAP with the uncorrected gain applied then represents the
true antenna gain at that orientation referred to the known accuracy of
the downlink signal.

**Validation of the isolation between the streams**

Once the RSAP absolute error has been measured and removed from the
measured antenna pattern the isolation of the streams in the second
stage can be measured. This could be done with static signals but what
matters is the isolation achieved under the more difficult dynamic
fading conditions. The isolation can be measured by establishing a
connection and, with the channel model and antenna pattern applied,
measure the difference in dB between the RSAP reported for each DUT
receiver. For a DUT to be usable with the RTS method a minimum isolation
has to be achieved of 15 dB averaged over at least 200 RSAP
measurements.

**Monotonicity check of RSAP and RSARP**

Once the minimum isolation of the radiated second stage has been
validated it is necessary to validate the linearity of RSAP and RSARP
measurements over the operating range -60 dB, to -80 dBm and +/- 180
degrees. This starts with a monotonicity check using a \[1\] dB step
size for RSAP and a \[5\] degree step size for RSARP. The step sizes of
the monotonicity check determine the accuracy to which the measurements
can be linearized. If the monotonicity check fails the RTS method is not
usable for the DUT.

**Linearization of RSAP and RSARP**

Once monotonicity has been validated, the linearity of RSAP can be
measured. This is done from the orientation of the peak antenna gain
over the range -60 dBm to -80 dBm. The linearity shall be \< \[1\] dB.
The linearity of RSARP shall be within \[5\] degrees over the range ±180
degrees measured at -60 dBm and -80 dBm. If the uncorrected RSAP or
RSARP results do not meet the linearity requirements, calculate and
apply a transfer function to the measured patterns to ensure the
necessary linearity.

#### 6.3.1.4 Candidate solution 4

##### 6.3.1.4.1 Concept and configuration

In this method an assessment of the antenna\'s performance in MIMO or
Diversity operation is performed. Several simplifications are used in
order to optimise the testing.

A test of the UE in an anechoic environment with the help of a base
station emulator is proposed, with a limited number of faded channels
and transmitting antennas, and in a simple geometrical set-up.

The underlying principle is to decompose the task for evaluating MIMO
performance. It combines the radiated measurements in the anechoic
chamber where no fading is applied with conducted measurements with
fading. The total performance of the UE is decomposed into these two
steps, and therefore we name it decomposition approach. Figure
6.3.1.4.1-1 illustrates this approach.

Figure 6.3.1.4.1-1: Diagram of decomposition approach for 2x2 LTE MIMO

##### 6.3.1.4.2 Decomposition approach

To determine the throughput results for the overall MIMO device
performance, the following key measurements are needed, as shown in
Figure 6.3.1.4.2-1:

\- Baseline: the conducted measurement with channel model of the
identity matrix

\- Conducted: the conducted measurement with the real-world channel
model

\- Radiated: the average of the radiated measurements for a set of
antenna constellations

Figure 6.3.1.4.2-1: Key measurements for Decomposition Approach

From these measurements, the receiver MIMO efficiency and the antenna
MIMO efficiency are determined as illustrated in Figure 6.3.1.4.2-2. The
receiver MIMO efficiency is defined as the difference between the
baseline conducted test and the conducted test with dynamic fading as a
function of throughput, Figure 6.3.1.4.2-2 (a).\
Similarly, the antenna MIMO efficiency is defined as the difference
between the baseline conducted test and the radiated test for all
throughput levels, Figure 6.3.1.4.2-2 (b)

**\
(a)**\
\
**\
(b)**

Figure 6.3.1.4.2-2: Definition of (a) receiver MIMO and b) antenna MIMO
efficiencies

The relative Figure Of Merit (FOM) for the UE MIMO performance is
subsequently defined as the UE MIMO efficiency that is the sum of the
receiver and antenna MIMO efficiencies. By adding this efficiency to the
baseline throughput curve, the absolute FOM for the UE MIMO performance,
i.e., decomposed throughput curve as a function of DL power level, can
be obtained as shown in 6.3.1.4.2-3.

Figure 6.3.1.4.2-3: Illustration of the decomposed throughput curve
calculation

##### 6.3.1.4.3 Conducted test

In the conducted tests, measurements with different channel models have
to be performed.

The most basic Channel Model (CM) is the identity static channel matrix
without fading.

This matrix provides a frequency-flat transfer characteristic that does
not change over time. Since non-diagonal elements of the channel matrix
are zero, each RF port of the UE receives a single LTE data stream. This
ideal CM characterizes the noise figure of the MIMO receiver and acts as
a \"baseline\" for further testing.

Another test has to be performed with the CM selected. Typically the
channel models are either based on SCME UMa or UMi. Since the channel
models are applied in conducted mode, the spatial information of the
base station antenna correlation is calculated numerically and
implemented as coefficient alpha in the fading model. The coefficient
beta describing the correlation at the UE side is set to zero.

##### 6.3.1.4.4 Radiated test

The two-channel method is covering the radiated part of the test where
the performance of the UE\'s antenna subsystem is evaluated. It is using
two probe antennas and one azimuth positioner in order to cover a large
number of different angle-of-arrival constellations. In each
constellation also the polarizations of the two probe antennas are
defined.

For an RX MIMO measurement (TM2 or TM3), the two signals from the base
station emulator are routed directly to the probe antennas with the
chosen polarization.

In order to assess the radiated performance of the MIMO antenna system
in 3D, the UE shall be tested for a set of antenna constellations
uniformly covering the sphere and generating a wide variety of AoAs. In
the radiated test the constellations are categorized as spatial
constellations, i.e, the azimuth orientation of the UE and the elevation
positions of the two DL antennas and as polarization constellations,
i.e., the set of polarizations of the DL antennas used to transmit the
LTE MIMO streams. Figure 6.3.1.4.4-1 highlights the key parameters for
each constellation category.

(a)\
\
\
(b)

Figure 6.3.1.4.4-1: Overview of (a) spatial and (b) polarization
constellations

An optimized constellation approach determines a set of constellations.\
The algorithm used has been written specifically for the decomposition
approach.\
A total of 128 constellations have been identified to be sufficient in
order to sample the antenna performance.

For each constellation, a curve of throughput as a function of DL power
level or SNR is recorded.\
At the end of the test, i.e., 128 constellations, an average of all
curves is determined that represents the FOM for the MIMO antenna
subsystem performance for a complete set of 3D AoAs.

##### 6.3.1.4.5 Possible extensions of the decomposition method

There are several possible extensions of the method briefly addressed in
this Clause.

• The channel information available in the UE can be used to deliver a
quick answer to the test system about the current receive quality. If
necessary, an explicit scaling from one quantity onto the other one can
be made.

• In case of an RX diversity measurement the signal from the base
station emulator has to be routed via a two-channel fading to the two
probe antennas in the chamber in order to decorrelate the signals.

• In addition of the movements of the probe antennas and the azimuth
positioner, the UE may be tilted by some additional rotation around the
horizontal axis.

• As a special case it is also possible to test with one antenna where
each polarization is transmitting one MIMO data stream.

• As an alternative to moving the antennas by mechanically rotating them
it is possible to arrange the antennas in a horizontal plane and to move
one antenna with respect to the other in order to vary the angle
difference between the two. In that case the positioner rotating the UE
will be designed in a more complex way.

• If one wants to extend this method to 3D AoA, a third antenna outside
the plane can be used.

The OTA performance can better be described by taking statistical
evaluations into account. If, for example, for each test point a
relative throughput value is obtained as function of subcarrier power,
one can plot the results for different points in a histogram and to
obtain some CCDF indicating the conditions for getting at least a given
throughput value.

#### 6.3.1.5 Candidate solution 5

The RF-controlled spatial fading emulator can directly reproduce a
multipath radio propagation environment by radio waves emitted from
antenna-probe units arranged around a handset tested. Moreover, the
emulator has an advantage of measuring radiation characteristics of a
handset antenna for the present OTA testing in 3GPP as well as the
multipath testing because of its RF operation \[6\].

##### 6.3.1.5.1 Concept and configuration

The RF-controlled spatial fading emulator can directly reproduce
multipath radio propagation environments both in Line-Of-Sight (LOS) and
Non Line-Of-Sight (NLOS) situations by radio waves emitted from antenna
probes arranged around a DUT. Thus, the emulator can be easily used for
measurement of the MIMO characteristics of a HSPA/LTE multiple antenna
device in a multipath fading environment.

Figure 6.3.1.5.1-1 (a) and (b) show the configuration and arrangement of
the antenna probes of the RF spatial fading emulator in an anechoic
chamber. In this method, the DUT is designated as any device that
possesses multiple antennas, including a HSPA or LTE device.

The height of DUT from the floor of the anechoic chamber is ***H***. The
DUT can also be placed at a rotatable turn-table in order to set and
vary the horizontal angle of the DUT. The DUT is surrounded by ***N***
numbers of antenna probes.\
The distance between DUT and each antenna probe is ***r***. The antenna
probe consists of two antennas.\
The one is a half-wavelength dipole set vertically for emitting the
vertically-polarized wave and the other is a horizontally-located
half-wavelength dipole for the horizontally-polarized wave. This
configuration of the antenna-probe unit can represent a cross
polarization power ratio, XPR, of incoming wave. The separation between
vertical and horizontal antennas is ***d***. The height of the antenna
probe from the anechoic chamber floor is ***h***. The distance between
the ring of antenna probes and the walls of anechoic chamber is ***D***.
(Note if the anechoic chamber is not square, then ***D~1~*** and
***D~2~*** are used).

A reference antenna probe is designated so that it can be used to
determine the direction of motion of DUT.\
This parameter is designated as . The circular angle between antenna
probes from the centre of the ring (i.e. DUT) is with respect to the
reference antenna probe.

Figure 6.3.1.5.1-1: Experimental setup of the spatial fading emulator

The key features of this method are that it does not use the
sophisticated commercial channel emulator.\
By using the combination of phase shifters, power dividers and
attenuators, operating in the RF band, it has been shown that a
realistic fading channel environment can be emulated. To reduce the
influence from the measurement equipment, the receiver, phase shifter,
power divider, transmitter and computer are set outside of the anechoic
chamber.\
Firstly, we describe channel response between the *m*^th^ base station,
BS, antenna and the *n*^th^ handset antenna for *M*-by-*N* MIMO radio
communication system. The channel response is calculated by following
equation:

\(1\)

where *E~n~* and *f~D~* are radiation component of the *n*-th handset
antenna and the Doppler frequency respectively. *φ~0~* is the direction
of motion and *φ*~i~ is the direction of the *i*-th antenna probe.
*α~mi~* is initial phase of the signal radiated from the *i*-th antenna
probe. The waves radiated from each base station (BS) antenna are
uncorrelated each other.\
For the investigation of MIMO antennas, the waves from different BS
antenna are represented by different sets of initial phases, *α~mi~*, of
the waves. According to the propagation models, such as SCM and SCME,
the angular power spectrum *Ω* of the spatial cluster of incoming waves
in the horizontal plane can be modelled by a Laplacian distribution in
the following, for instance:

\(2\)

where *P* and *μ~φ~* are power and average direction of angle of the
cluster. *σ* is a standard deviation of the APS. In this case, the
spatial distribution in the vertical plane is modelled by a delta
function.

In addition, the strongest point of the spatial fading emulator is to be
capable of evaluating radiation characteristics of a handset antenna for
the present OTA testing in 3GPP as well as the multipath-fading
evaluation since the emulator is operated in a Radio Frequency (RF)
band.

A calibration of the RF-controlled spatial fading emulator is carried
out using the following procedure:

1\) Firstly a half-wavelength dipole for the receiving antenna is
vertically placed at the center of a circle arranging the antenna
probes.

2\) A radio wave with vertical polarization is radiated only from a
vertical dipole of the antenna probe \#i (i=1, 2, ..., L), and then, the
dipole at the center of the emulator can receive the wave. From this, we
can obtain amplitude and phase of the RF signal from the transmitter to
the receiver via the vertical dipole of the antenna probe \#i.

3\) The attenuator and phase shifter are adjusted so that the RF signals
received by the dipole at the center have the same values in amplitude
and phase.

4\) Secondly the slotted cylindrical antenna is placed at the center of
the antenna probes located on the circle.

5\) A radio wave with horizontal polarization is radiated only from a
horizontally-located dipole of the antenna probe \#i (i=1, 2, ..., L).
From the received signal from the antenna probe \#i, we also obtain
amplitude and phase of the RF signal from the transmitter to the
receiver via the horizontal dipole of the antenna probe \#i.

6\) The attenuator and phase shifter are adjusted so that the RF signals
received by the slotted cylindrical antenna at the center have the same
values in amplitude and phase.

The calibration procedure above mentioned can be performed by using an
electrical-controlled RF switch.\
Thus, the calibration of the emulator can be done automatically using a
computer in our system. Once the calibration is finished, we can vary
the attenuators in order to produce a special distribution of the
incoming wave and to make a Cross polarization Power Ratio (XPR).
Moreover, we can set an initial phase to each antenna probe to create a
multipath fading channel.

With regard to the signal-to-noise power ratio, SNR, of incoming wave,
the signal power can be determined by an average value of faded signal
powers received by a half-wavelength dipole antenna for the vertical
polarization and a slotted cylindrical antenna for the horizontal
polarization. Both antennas have an omni-directional radiation pattern.
Thus, SNR can be obtained as the following equation:

\(3\)

where *S~V~* and *S~H~* are the average signal powers received by the
dipole and slotted cylindrical antennas, respectively.\
*N~0~* is the noise power that was calculated as a thermal noise within
the frequency bandwidth of the radio communication.

##### 6.3.1.5.2 Test conditions

In this method, all signals are operated and controlled at RF level. A
computer (either a laptop or relatively powerful computer) is used to
provide the followings:

1\) Graphical User Interface (GUI) to set the input parameters,
determine the measured parameters to be collected, setting of
calibration parameters and setting of DUT parameters.

2\) Generating control signals to manipulate the phase angle of each
Phase Shifter.

3\) Collecting measured raw data obtained via the DUT.

4\) Post-processing the measured raw data to derive the desired figure
of merits (i.e. minimum requirements for DUT).

5\) To initiate the BS emulator and start the testing session (by
establishing a communication session with DUT).

The RF signals transmitted from the BS emulator\'s antenna connector are
fed to a bank of Power Dividers.\
Each power divider provides identical RF signal from each of the output
ports.\
The number of Power Dividers required is determined by ***N***.

Each Power Divider output is then fed to a Phase Shifter. The Phase
Shifter is used to change the phase of the RF signal according to the
parameter setting input to the computer earlier. Note that the control
signal from the computer is digital-to-analogue, D/A, converted, before
used to control the Phase Shifter. By controlling the phase of each RF
signal, a Rayleigh distributed or other relevant multipath distribution
can be obtained.\
The number of Phase Shifters required is determined by ***N***.

The output of the Phase Shifters is connected to the antenna probes. The
signal from each Phase Shifter is fed to the vertical and horizontal
antennas and radiates toward the DUT. The DUT then measures the signals
from each antenna probe and the measurement data is reported back to the
computer. The amount of measurement data to be collected can be
controlled by the computer by setting the sampling rate, ***R***.

An example below illustrated the principle of creating Rayleigh faded
signal by control the phase of each component wave in Figure

### 6.3.2 Methodologies based on Reverberation Chamber

#### 6.3.2.1 Candidate solution 1

The Reverberation Chamber is a metallic cavity or cavities that can
emulate an isotropic multi-path environment which represents a reference
environment for systems designed to work during fading, similar to how
the free space \"anechoic\" reference environment is used for tests of
Line-Of-Sight systems. The Rayleigh environment in a reverberation
chamber is well known as a good reference for urban and indoor
environments, but does not well represent rural and suburban
environments.

For a future multi-antenna OTA measurement standard it is important to
have a fast and repeatable test method to evaluate and compare
multi-antenna devices in the environments and under the conditions where
most people will use them. The overwhelming majority of calls/data
connections with mobile phones are made indoors and in urban areas which
can be very well represented by the reverberation chamber. These
environments are well characterised by multi-path and 3D distribution of
the communication signals and it makes sense to use the reverberation
chamber for optimizing/evaluating devices with both single and multiple
antenna configurations to be used indoors and in urban areas.

The test setup for testing UE receiver diversity performance is composed
of a Base Station (BS) emulator, a reverberation chamber equipped with
fixed BS wall-mounted antennas, a switch to direct the base station
signal to/from one of the BS wall mounted antennas, mechanical metallic
stirrers and a rotating platform to hold the DUT (Figure 6.3.2.1-1).\
Alternatively, the chamber may contain one or more cavities coupled
through waveguides or slotted plates (Figure 7.1-2).

Reverberation chambers have no quiet zone. As long as the DUT is placed
at least 0.5 wavelengths from the wall or metallic stirrers the result
will be the same within the standard deviation of the chamber.

Mechanical stirrers and switching among different fixed BS wall-mounted
antennas (monopoles used for polarization stirring) allow simulating the
Rayleigh fading at each antenna of the terminal inside the chamber.
Accuracy can even been increased by rotating the platform holding the
device.

Each position of the mechanical stirrers for each position of the
platform and each fixed BS antenna, represents a point of the Rayleigh
distribution in terms of receive power on the device antennas. In that
way a Rayleigh fading is artificially created.

In that way, several UE metrics can be measured: throughput with RX-DIV,
TRP, TIS (Total Isotropic Sensitivity), etc.

For each point of the Rayleigh distribution created by the different
configurations of the chamber, the metric is noted. This method can be
used to measure UE sensitivity and UE radiated power.

##### 6.3.2.1.1 Concept and configuration

In order to calibrate the reverberation chamber a broadband antenna can
be used to measure the losses in the chamber with a network analyzer.
This takes \< 10 minutes. CTIA RCSG is working on a standard methodology
for reverberation chamber calibration.

There are no active electronics in the measurement path that needs to be
calibrated.

Reflections in turntables, cables, doors, etc, do not degrade accuracy.
Reflections increase the richness of the channel in the reverberation
chamber.

Existing studies show that low standard deviation (good accuracy) can be
achieved by measuring the DUT in sufficient number of different
positions and calculate the average of the values. Some analysis (see
relevant references in \[2\]) show a typical standard deviation less
than 0.5 dB at about 800 MHz, in a reverberation chamber with a size of\
1.2m x 1.75m x 1.8m and continuous mode stirring. At higher frequencies
or with a chamber of larger dimensions the standard deviation decreases
and accuracy increases.

The following figure presents an example for an HSDPA receive diversity
test configuration in a reverberation chamber.

For these tests we emulate an HSDPA call with a Node B emulator. The
latter is connected to one of the 3 BS wall-mounted antennas through a
switch. A fourth antenna allows measuring the DL received signal in the
chamber with a spectrum analyzer.

![](media/image43.emf)

Figure 6.3.2.1.1-1: Test bench configuration for testing in
reverberation chamber

In order to create a Rayleigh fading environment, we\'ve got 3 types of
parameters that can be set using a tool on a computer plugged to the
chamber:

\- Antenna among the 3, installed at the top of the cavity with
different polarizations, is chosen;

\- Turning the platform that holds the DUT;

\- The 2 metallic stirrers near the walls can be moved on their axes.

##### 6.3.2.1.2 Test conditions

Once the chamber is calibrated, the downlink throughput testing can be
performed as follows to get one throughput averaged measurement:

• The DUT is placed in the chamber at least 0.5 wavelengths from the
wall or from the metallic stirrers.

• An HSDPA call is emulated using the NodeB emulator with a pre-defined
BS TX power.

• To get one measurement sample we set up one of the following possible
combinations: position of the rotating platform {0, π/2, π, 3π/2, etc.}
+ position of the metallic stirrers {0, 25, 50, 75, 100, etc.} + antenna
from {1, 2, 3}.

• For each one of these combinations we can record CQI, DL Throughput
and DL Power in the chamber.\
The latter is measured using a fourth antenna and a spectrum analyzer.
This constitutes one measurement sample. For each measurement sample,
the link adaptation is performed manually or automatically on the NodeB
emulator as follows: the HS-DSCH is configured (modulation, transport
block size, number of HS-DSCH) depending on the CQI (Channel Quality
Indicator) reported by the UE (User Equipment) according to the mapping
table in 3GPP TS 25.214 \[5\].

• Once enough different DL throughput measurement samples (ideally ≥
100), corresponding to different Antenna, rotating platform\'s position
and stirrers\' position combinations, are recorded for the same NodeB
emulator DL TX power, they can be averaged to have the averaged DL
throughput measurement.

The test duration can be significantly reduced if all these steps are
automated. With a Variable Reference Channel (VRC) and continuous mode
stirring total measurement time of less than 10 minutes could be
possible.

#### 6.3.2.2 Candidate solution 2

The reverberation chamber by itself has a limited range of channel
modelling capabilities. Specifically,

• The power/delay profile is limited to a single decaying exponential.

• The Doppler spectrum and maximum Doppler is limited by the relatively
slow motion of the stirrers.

• It is difficult to impart a specific, repeatable MIMO fading
correlation on the downlink waveform.

These limitations can be overcome when a MIMO channel emulator and
reverberation chamber are cascaded.

The Power/Delay Profile (PDP) can be enhanced beyond the single decaying
exponential by programming the channel emulator with fading taps set at
the desired excess delays. The resulting PDP will be the convolution of
the taps provided by the channel.

The fading taps provided by the channel emulator allow much higher
Doppler spreads than from the reverberation chamber alone. If a
classical fading spectrum with a maximum Doppler of 100 Hz is desired,
the channel emulator is configured to provide this. The resulting
overall Doppler spectrum that results is the convolution of the channel
emulator\'s Doppler spectrum with that of the reverberation chamber.

The fading produced by the cascaded channel emulator and reverberation
chamber has a double-Rayleigh amplitude distribution. Because
performance simulations generally use Rayleigh fading, simulation
results for the double-Rayleigh case are not available.

The benefit is testing with a much higher maximum Doppler, on the order
of 100 Hz or higher, than is possible with the reverberation chamber
alone. Under these conditions, the reverberation chamber-induced fading
will effectively be constant while the channel emulator-induced fading
will dominate. Therefore, while a receiver\'s performance under such
circumstances will definitely be different than under normal Rayleigh
fading conditions, it should not undermine the receiver\'s ability to
demodulate. Tests have shown that this is indeed the case. However, due
to the lack of double-Rayleigh simulation results, measured results
should only be compared with other devices using these same test
conditions.

The correlation of fading between the downlink MIMO transmission paths
can be adjusted using the channel emulator. This is also known as \"BS
correlation\", reflecting the fact that it is controlled on the BS side
of the link.\
The way to set this correlation using the channel emulator is as
follows: using the Kronecker model of fading correlation, set the
desired correlation of the transmit or BS correlation matrix. The
receiver or MS correlation matrix should be set to identity. An example
is given for a 2x2 MIMO system:

The value for *ρ * is the desired correlation between the two downlink
paths. Note that it is not possible to control the phase of the
correlation, only the amplitude.

The downlink antennas in the chamber are typically referred to as
\"wall\" antennas. There should be a number of them equal to the number
of spatial streams supported by the DUT. The spacing of the wall
antennas is not very important. Tests have shown that as the spacing
between them is changed over a range between 6 and 80 mm, the measured
correlation changes very little, on the order of 5% to 10%.

##### 6.3.2.2.1 Concept and configuration

The general configuration to be used for testing is shown in Figure
6.3.2.2.1-1. The specific example show there is for two BS antennas. If
higher order MIMO devices are to be tested, additional antennas are
required. The channel emulator is placed between the (e)NodeB emulator
and the reverberation chamber. Two calibrations are performed:

1\) Calibration of reverberation chamber loading to set the proper
chamber impulse response. Most of the time, the chamber will be loaded
to produce a specific, desired chamber RMS delay spread. This is
achieved using such devices as a phantom head, tank filled with liquid,
and RF absorbing foam. For use with the channel emulator, it is
desirable to set the chamber RMS delay spread as low as is allowable
(approximately 55 ns - see Note), although higher RMS delay spreads are
also legitimate, depending on the desired overall PDP.

NOTE: If the delay spread is reduced to below this point, the chamber\'s
ability to produce the desired Rayleigh amplitude distribution at the
DUT is degraded.

2\) Calibration of the losses from (e)NodeB emulator to DUT location.
This is already described in the test methodology for the reverberation
chamber alone (subclause 6.3.2.1).

The calibrations are performed in this order, using a test antenna as
the DUT antenna, and with the DUT in the chamber as it will be during
the test. The contents of the chamber should not be disturbed after the
calibration is complete.\
More information about the calibration procedures are found in Annex F.

emulator and\
reverberation chamber for a 2x2 MIMO configuration

##### 6.3.2.2.2 Test conditions

After the chamber is calibrated, the emulator is configured for the
desired channel model, including the end-to-end PDP, the desired fading
spectrum and Doppler spread, and the MIMO fading correlation. At this
point, the system is ready to test the DUT, and a procedure appropriate
to the Figure Of Merit (FOM) being measured is carried out.

There are three (3) operating methods, dependent on the motion of the
stirrers and the state of the fading in the channel emulator.

In method 1, the stirrers, turntable or source antennas and channel
emulator to operate continuously while the specific FOM is measured. A
good example of this use would be throughput measurements under the
conditions of a high Doppler rate, or, measured while the signal levels
are varied over a wide range.

In method 2, the stirrers and turntable or source antennas are
positioned in a number of combinations as described in 6.3.2.1.2. The
channel emulator is allowed to run for a fixed length of time (usually 1
or 2 seconds is enough) and paused. The FOM is measured while the
stirrers and turntable are not in motion, and the channel emulator is
paused.\
In this method, the number of fixed positions and emulator states must
be at least enough to guarantee the proper amplitude distribution.
Automation of this entire procedure will significantly reduce the test
time.

In method 3, the stirrers and turntable and/or source antennas are
positioned as in method 2, but for each position, the channel emulator
is allowed to run the fading channel model. The FOM is measured with the
stirrers and turntable or source antenna stirring fixed and the channel
emulator fading. This method is most analogous to the anechoic method
which fixes the device rotation and runs the fading channel emulator
while the FOM is measured. This method may also facilitate simulation.

8 Channel Models
================

8.1 Introduction
----------------

In order to understand how different methodologies are able to similarly
distinguish good and bad MIMO devices, it is important to ensure that
the radio propagation conditions that are implying to a particular DUT
are the same or similar to a certain extent.

The different channel models are used as a simple way to create complex
multipath radio propagation conditions and RAN4 has agreed to compare
the realization of those channel models across the different methods.

8.2 Channel Model(s) to be validated
------------------------------------

Editor\'s Note: Initially a small set of representative channel models
shall be agreed and use to validate channel model realization. Other
channel models could be used at a later stage.\
This clause shall also contain the identification of the main properties
that characterize a given channel model as well as the expected results
when realizing a channel model regardless of the methodology.

The following channel models are to be used in evaluation of MIMO OTA
methodologies.

The generic models are

• SCME Urban micro-cell, and

• SCME Urban macro-cell.

In addition, the BS antenna assumptions defined in subclause 8.5 also
apply when emulating the channel models.

In the following we define the cross polarization power ratio a
propagation channel as , where

and

and

• S~VV~ is the coefficient for scattered/reflected power on
V-polarization and incident power on V-polarization;

• S~VH~ is the coefficient for scattered/reflected power on
V-polarization and incident power on H-polarization;

• S~HV~ is the coefficient for scattered/reflected power on
H-polarization and incident power on V-polarization;

• S~HH~ is the coefficient for scattered/reflected power on
H-polarization and incident power on H-polarization.

NOTE: For Vertical only measurements, the powers per delay are used
without regard to the specified XPR values.

The following SCME Urban Micro-cell is unchanged from the original SCME
paper, with added XPR values, Direction of Travel, and Velocity.

The parameters of the channel models are the expected parameters for the
MIMO OTA channel models.\
However, the final channel model achieved for different methods could be
a combined effect of the chamber and the channel emulator.

The Rayleigh fading may be implementation specific. However, the fading
can be considered to be appropriate as long as the statistics of the
generated Rayleigh fading are within standard requirement on Rayleigh
fading statistics.

Editor\'s Note: NIST channel model is not ruled out, but before it can
be used, more information on the AoA values would need to be provided.

8.3 Verification of Channel Model implementations
-------------------------------------------------

Channel Models have been specified in Clause 8.2.\
This clause describes the MIMO OTA validation measurements, in order to
ensure that the channel models are correctly implemented and hence
capable of generating the propagation environment, as described by the
model, within a test area, Measurements are done mainly with a Vector
Network Analyser (VNA) and a spectrum analyzer.

Note that the term \"**OTA antenna configuration**\" used in this
subclause refers only to the physical antennas used to perform the
validation. The BS antenna assumptions defined as part of the channel
model in subclause 8.5 apply in addition to the physical antenna
configuration.

### 8.3.1 Measurement instruments and setup

The measurement setup includes the following equipment:

Table 8.3.1-1: Measurement equipment list for the verification procedure

  Item   Quantity   Item
  ------ ---------- -------------------
  1      1          Channel Emulator
  2      1          Signal Generator
  3      1          Spectrum Analyzer
  4      1          VNA
  5      1          Magnetic Dipole
  6      1          Sleeve Dipole

#### 8.3.1.1 Vector Network Analyzer (VNA) setup

Most of the measurements are performed with a VNA. An example set of
equipment required for this set-up is shown in Figure 8.3.1.1-1. VNA
transmits frequency sweep signals thorough the MIMO OTA test system.\
A test antenna, within the test area, receives the signal and VNA
analyzes the frequency response of the system.\
A number of traces (frequency responses) are measured and recorded by
VNA and analyzed by a post processing SW, e.g., Matlab. Special care has
to be taken into account to keep the fading conditions unchanged, i.e.
frozen, during the short period of time of a single trace measurement.
The fading may proceed only in between traces. This setup can be used to
measure PDP, Spatial Correlation and Polarization of the Channel models
defined in clause 8.2.

#### 8.3.1.2 Spectrum Analyzer (SA) setup

The Doppler spectrum is measured with a spectrum analyzer as shown in
Figure 8.3.1.2-1. In this case a signal generator transmits CW signal
through the MIMO OTA test system. The signal is received by a test
antenna within the test area. Finally the signal is analyzed by a
spectrum analyzer and the measured spectrum is compared to the target
spectrum. This setup can be used to measure Doppler Spectrum of the
Channel models defined in Clause 8.2.

Figure 8.3.1.2-1: Setup for VNA measurements

The RTS channel model validation setup consists of a vector signal
generator and a spectrum analyser with signal analysis capabilities or
scope as depicted in Figure 8.3.1.2-2 and the provided validation
procedures apply for both, correlation-based and geometry-based channel
model implementations. For RTS implementations that use a standalone
channel emulator, the channel validation procedures in this clause may
not apply; instead, the MPAC validation procedures may be carried out.

### 8.3.2 Validation measurements

#### 8.3.2.1 Power Delay Profile (PDP)

This measurement checks that the resulting Power Delay Profile (PDP) is
like defined in the channel model.

**Method of measurement:**

Step the emulation and store traces from VNA. I.e. run the emulation to
CIR number 1, pause, measure VNA trace, run the emulation to CIR number
10, pause, measure VNA trace. Continue until 1000 VNA traces are
measured.

**Method of measurement result analysis:**

Measured VNA traces (frequency responses H(t,f)) are saved into a hard
drive. The data is read into, e.g., Matlab.\
The analysis is performed by taking the Fourier transform of each FR.
The resulting impulse responses h(t,tau) are averaged in power over
time:

Finally the resulting PDP is shifted in delay, such that the first tap
is on delay zero. The reference PDP plots from Table 8.2-1 and Table
8.2-2 are shown in Figure 8.3.2.1-1.

**OTA antenna configuration:** For e.g. 1 full ring (or single cluster
configuration) of V polarized elements.

**Measurement antenna:** For e.g. Vertically oriented sleeve dipole.

Micro\
plotted from Table 8.2-1 and Table 8.2-2

**Method of measurement for RTS:**

The vector signal generator repeatedly generates the Zadoff-Chu sequence
as defined in Table 8.3.2.1-3. After a given time interval, the spectrum
analyser or scope is triggered by the vector signal generator at the
beginning of the next Zadoff-Chu sequence. The time interval needs to
exceed the required minimum distance between two PDPs as defined in
Table 8.3.2.1-4 and depends on the centre frequency and the mobile
speed.

After receiving the trigger signal, the spectrum analyser or scope
starts with the acquisition of the IQ data. The number of recorded IQ
samples corresponds to the length of the used Zadoff-Chu sequence. This
step is repeated until at least 1000 blocks of IQ samples are recorded.

The channel model specifications match those from Table 8.3.2.1-2.

**Method of measurement result analysis:**

The measured blocks of IQ samples are saved and later analysed by a post
processing SW, e.g., Matlab. The analysis is performed by applying the
circular cross-correlation between each recorded block of IQ samples and
the IQ samples of the original Zadoff-Chu sequence. The resulting
impulse responses h(t,tau) are averaged in power over time:

Finally the resulting PDP is shifted in delay and normalized in power,
such that the first tap is on delay zero and has a relative power of
0 dB.

**Antenna configurations:** For e.g. a pair of vertically oriented
sleeve dipoles or vertically polarized horn antennas.

#### 8.3.2.2 Doppler/Temporal correlation

This measurement checks the Doppler/temporal correlation.

**Method of measurement:**

Sine wave (CW, carrier wave) signal is transmitted from the signal
generator. The signal is connected from the signal generator to fading
emulator via cables. The fading emulator output signals are connected to
power amplifier boxes via cables. The amplified signals are then
transferred via cables to the probe antennas. The probe antennas radiate
the signals over the air to the test antenna The Doppler spectrum is
measured by the spectrum analyzer and the trace is saved.

#### 8.3.2.3 Spatial correlation

This measurement checks whether the measured correlation curve follows
the theoretical curve.

**Method of measurement:**

Step the emulation and store traces from VNA. I.e. run the emulation to
CIR number 1, pause, measure VNA traces in 11 different DUT positions,
run the emulation to CIR number 10, pause, measure VNA traces in 11
different DUT positions, ... etc. Continue until frequency response of
1000 CIRs in 11 positions (=1000\*11 VNA traces) are measured.

11 test antenna positions sample a segment of line of length 1
wavelength with sampling interval of 0.1 wavelengths. Antenna spacing
(wave lengths): -0.5 to +0.5 step of 0.1.

**Method of Measurement Results Analysis**

Calculate correlation of 1000 x 11 matrix **H**(*f*) of frequency
response samples. The procedure is to correlate sixth column (the trace
measured at the centre of chamber) with the 10 other columns as follows
(Matlab example)

> for ind = 1:11;
>
> Corr(: , : , ind) = abs(corrcoef(**H**(: , 1),**H**(: , ind)));
>
> end
>
> Correlation = squeeze(Corr(1, 2, :));

The reference spatial correlation plots from Table 8.2-1 and 8.2-2 are
shown in Figure 8.3.2.3-2.

For RTS, spatial correlation is verified using the setup in Figure
8.3.1.2-2. The channel emulator is configured for a MIMO channel model
with two transmit and two receive antenna patterns. The transmit
antennas are assumed to be dual-polarized equal power elements with a
fixed 0λ separation, 45 degrees slanted, Clause 8.5, while the two
receiver antennas are configured as vertically polarized dipoles with
varying antenna separation. The antenna positions sample a line of
length 1λ with a sampling interval of 0.1λ. Both antennas and the
respective patterns are simulated in the channel emulator.

+-----------------------+-------------------+-----------------------+

The channel model specifications match those from Table 8.3.2.3-2.

**Measurement Process:**

For each antenna position, the signal generator continuously sends the
Zadoff-Chu sequence to the channel emulator which applies the required
channel model as specified in Table 8.3.2.3-2. The output RF signal from
the channel emulator is connected to the TX antenna and received by the
RX antenna which is connected to the RF input of the spectrum analyser
or scope, Figure 8.3.1.2-2.

The RF signals received by the RX antenna for different simulated
antenna positions/separations are captured by the spectrum analyser or
the scope. The spatial correlation analysis is performed by performing
the cross-correlation operation directly on the received signals
captured for different antenna positions/separations.

#### 8.3.2.4 Cross-polarization

This measurement checks how well the measured vertically or horizontally
polarized power levels follow expected values.

**Method of measurement:** Step the emulation and store traces from VNA.

**Measurement Procedure**

1\. Play or step through the channel model -\> SCME UMi, or UMa X Corr.

2\. Measure the absolute power received at the center of the array,
averaged over a statistically significant number of fades.

a\. Use a vertically polarized sleeve dipole to measure the V component.

b\. Use a horizontally polarized (vertically oriented) magnetic loop
dipole, or a horizontally polarized sleeve dipole measured in two
orthogonal horizontal positions and summed to measure the H component.

3\. Calculate the V/H ratio.

4\. Compare it with the theory -\> 0.74dB for UMi, and 8.13dB for UMa.

**Expected measurement results**

V/H ratio (composite, i.e. all 6 paths combined) of the 3GPP SCME Umicro
model is 0.74 dB and for Umacro 8.13 dB.\
The BS antennas are isotropic dipoles with +/- 45 degrees slant and
subject to a foreshortening of the slanted radiating element. See
channel model details specified in clause 8.2.

For RTS, the cross-polarization is verified using the setup in Figure
8.3.1.2-2. The channel emulator is configured for a MIMO channel model
with two transmit and two receive antenna patterns. The transmit antenna
patterns are assumed to be dual-polarized equal power elements with a
fixed 0λ separation, 45 degrees slanted, Clause 8.5. One simulated
receive antenna is configured as an ideal dipole with vertical
polarization, and the other one is configured as ideal dipole with
horizontal polarization. Both antennas have a fixed 0λ separation.

This cross polarization measurement verifies the correct power ratio of
the different polarizations in the channel model. The measurement can be
accomplished by either using a physical transmit and receive antenna
with a single polarization while alternately changing the RX antenna
polarization configuration in the fading emulator or by using physical
dual-polarized antennas with high isolation between the two
polarizations of the transmit and receive antennas. Both approaches
guarantee that only the cross polarization of the channel model is
verified.

**Channel model specification:**

The channel model specifications match those from Table 8.3.2.4-2.

**Measurement Procedure**

1\. Play the channel model defined in Table 8.3.2.4-2.

2\. Measure the absolute power received at the RX antenna, averaged over
a statistically sufficient number of fades (defined as channel model
samples in Table 8.3.2.4-2).

a\. Measure the power intended for the vertically polarized receive
antenna to measure the V component.

b\. Measure the power intended for the horizontally polarized receive
antenna to measure the H component.

3\. Calculate the V/H ratio.

Theoretical and expected measurement results are the same as MPAC.

### 8.3.3 Reporting

The tolerance for the channel model measurements is defined in tables
8.3.3-2, 8.3.3-3, 8.3.3-4 and 8.3.3-5.

These tolerances are based on what can practically be measured for each
metric in order that pass/fail limits can be defined for validation of
acceptable channel model implementation. Studies of the impact on
non-ideal channel model implementation have not been carried out and
therefore it may be necessary in the future when a better understanding
of the impact of the channel model implementation on throughput
measurements is found, that these tolerance values may need to be
revised.

8.4 Channel Model validation results
------------------------------------

### 8.4.1 Scope

Clauses 8.4.2-6 contain the validation results of channel models defined
in Clause 8.2 for companies using methods as described in Clauses
6.3.1.1 , 6.3.1.2 and 6.3.1.3. These results are based on three
different types of channel emulators and setup vendors, and all three
sets of results are included here for comparison.

### 8.4.2 Power Delay Profile (PDP)

The power delay profiles of the SCME UMi channel model specified in
Clause 8.2 has been measured according to the procedures in 8.3.2.1.
Figure 8.4.1-1a below illustrates the measured results for Band 13, and
Band 7.

8.5 Channel Model emulation of the Base Station antenna pattern configuration
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Editor\'s Note: To include the agreed X-polarized method. Any additional
approach would need to be clearly specified.

The emulated BS antennas to be used for all emulation of the channel
models defined in subclause 8.2 shall be assumed to be dual polarized
equal power elements with a fixed 0λ separation, 45 degrees slanted.

The slant 45 degree antenna is an \"X\" configuration and is modelled as
an ideal dipole with isotropic gain and subject to a foreshortening of
the slanted radiating element, which is observed to vary as a function
of the path angle of departure. This foreshortening with AoD is a
typical slanted dipole behaviour and is a source of power variation in
the channel model. The effective antenna pattern for this antenna is
illustrated in Figure 8.5-1.

### 9.3.1 The Absolute Data Throughput Comparison Framework

#### 9.3.1.1 Introduction

In an effort to compare different MIMO OTA methodologies\' results to
conducted results under the implementations of channel models defined in
clause 8.2, the absolute data throughput comparison framework has been
defined.\
By utilizing the reference antennas (clause 9.1) and reference devices
(clause 9.2), this framework shall be used to compare each MIMO OTA
testing method\'s ability to emulate the specified network and channel
propagation characteristics based on an absolute data throughput metric.

The framework consists of a set of conducted (Figure 9.3.1.1-1) and
radiated (Figure 9.3.1.1-2) measurements of MIMO throughput (clause
5.1.1). The details for the application of this framework are described
in clause 9.3.1.6.

Figure 9.3.1.1-2: Method of measuring the absolute radiated data
throughput metric\
with the reference antennas

The following subclauses define the antenna pattern data format,
emulation of antenna pattern rotation, absolute data throughput
measurement enabler, and the output data format.

#### 9.3.1.2 Antenna pattern data format

The antenna pattern data format---used in the conducted portion of the
measurements --- shall be in the 3D AAU format as defined by COST IC1004
\[14\]. Table 9.3.1.2-1 and 9.3.1.2-2 below illustrates the header
structure with a sample data set respectively.

The file name format shall be defined as \"(lab acronym)\_(antenna
serial number)\_CTIA\_MIMO 2x2\_Band(B7, B13..Bxx)\_(Good, Nominal, or
Bad)\_Ant(1 or 2).3daau\".

Based on experiments taken with low (\<1GHz) and high (\>1.8GHz)
frequency band antennas, the magnitude of the complex correlation
coefficient generated from measured data remains unchanged from higher
resolution antenna pattern measurements up to 15 degrees resolution in
theta and phi orientations. To align with current COST IC1004 TWGO MIMO
OTA topic group proposed resolution for 3D MIMO OTA complex radiation
pattern measurements, the antenna pattern measurement step size in theta
and phi shall be no more than 5 degrees. In the specific case of 2D
measurements theta is fixed at 90 degrees.

#### 9.3.1.3 Emulation of antenna pattern rotation

For the conducted portion of the absolute data throughput framework, it
is necessary to generate the spatially filtered channel impulse response
per polarization and then combine to generate the emulated channel
impulse response coefficients. The measured antenna pattern shall be
interpolated to match the spatial resolution of the angles of arrival of
the SCME channel emulator (this value is typically 1 degrees). Figure
9.3.1.3-1 below illustrates an example of this procedure using a
simplified antenna pattern and channel PAS.

![](media/image119.emf)

Figure 9.3.1.3-1: Rotation of antenna pattern over azimuth positions

In general, the emulation of antenna pattern rotation is specific to the
channel model. For 2D channel models antenna pattern rotation shall be
performed over 360 degrees in 30 degree steps (12 total positions). For
other channel models this process is FFS.

A spatial filtering operation alone does not capture the behaviour of
the 2D channel model as a function of DUT rotation. Figure 9.3.1.3-2
below illustrates the geometric parameters of the 2D channel model
\[15\] for two DUT rotations.

a)![](media/image120.emf)

b\) ![](media/image121.emf)

Figure 9.3.1.3-2: (a) 2D channel model geometric parameters for MS array
direction = 0 degrees;\
(b) MS array direction = 60 degrees

For a given rotation of the DUT, the angle of the MS array relative to
the cluster angles of arrival changes. Thus, MS array rotation together
with the spatial filtering operations described above is necessary to
emulate the conducted portion of the framework properly. Doppler spread,
which is a function of the MS direction of travel relative to the
channel model clusters\' angles of arrival, shall remain the same for
all rotations of the DUT.

Calculation of the required spatial filtering operations as a function
of DUT orientation for channel emulators using a geometric
implementation is self-evident from Figures 9.3.1.3-1 and 9.3.1.3-2. For
channel emulators implementing the alternative correlation-based
approach, the same spatial filtering operations are carried out by
computing the correlation matrix and power imbalance for the specific
channel model used and then applying the calculated correlation matrix
and power in the channel emulation. The detail for how this is done is
considered implementation specific and is not elaborated further here.
It is noted that the correlation implementation results in a Doppler
spectrum and corresponding temporal correlation that is independent of
DUT orientation.

This process may be automated with channel emulator control software or
performed manually. The output data format is described in clause
9.3.1.5.

#### 9.3.1.4 Absolute Data Throughput measurement enabler

The fundamental enabler for the adoption of the Absolute Data Throughput
metric is the ability to apply the complex radiation pattern to the
channel for the conducted portion of the test. Such conducted
measurements can be performed manually; however, without an application
(SW) to rotate the loaded antenna complex radiation pattern, the
measurement may become very time consuming and prone to human errors.
Automation of this process is highly recommended.

#### 9.3.1.5 Output data format

A unified data format for recording the conducted and radiated test
results by each lab is defined in Tables 9.3.1.5-1 and 9.3.1.5-2 below.

#### 9.3.1.6 Application of the framework and scenarios for comparison

This framework is methodology agnostic, and shall be used to compare
each MIMO OTA testing method\'s ability to emulate the specified network
and channel propagation characteristics based on an absolute data
throughput metric (Clause 5.1.1).

The purposes of this framework are:

\- For the agreed Channel Models, currently SCME Umi and Uma, to
understand and quantify what are the deviations (if any) introduced by
the chamber used in radiated mode compared to the conducted mode (when
reference antennas are embedded). This shall be applied inter labs for
the same method and inter methods.

\- For methods that are able to reproduce channel models that are not
agreed in the present document, it can be used to define the channel
model details that need to be injected in the conducted test to obtain
same results in the radiated part. And therefore it is easier to
reproduce those conditions across methods.

The above use cases for the framework are required to be conducted for
inter methodology comparison.\
Other applications for the framework are optional and not excluded.

And more concretely, the following scenarios for comparison are defined:

Figure 9.3.1.6-1: Application of the framework and scenarios for
comparison

These scenarios are intended to address the following aspects:

1\. **The first scenario**, anechoic based: intended to compare the
conducted portion of the test (with embedded radiation pattern antennas)
with the same results of the radiated test.\
Throughputs are compared to understand any artifacts introduced by the
setup.

2\. **The second scenario**, reverberation based: intended to compare
the conducted portion of the test (with embedded radiation pattern
antennas) with the same results of the radiated test.\
Throughputs are compared to understand any artifacts introduced by the
setup.

3\. **The third scenario**, reverberation based: intended to compare the
conducted portion of the test (with embedded radiation pattern antennas)
and with 3D isotropic channel model with the same results of the
radiated test.\
Throughputs are compared to understand any artifacts introduced by the
setup.\
Additionally this scenario will help to define the 3D isotropic
properties of the channel model as perceived by the UE in the reverb
chamber, and compare its realization in the conducted portion.

NOTE: If scenario2 holds true, it would mean that for the agreed setup
anechoic method and reverberation method provides comparable results for
the agreed channel models in the present document, currently 2D SCME.

#### 9.3.1.7 Proof of concept

##### 9.3.1.7.1 The first scenario, anechoic based

The implementation of the Absolute Data Throughput Framework based in
the first scenario; i.e. anechoic chamber ring of probes; is defined in
Clause 9.3.1.6 and table 9.3.1.7.1-1.\
Figure 9.3.1.7.1-2 indicates variation equal or less than 0.5dB when
comparing OTA measurements with correspondent conducted measurements,
therefore validating the framework concept.

### 10.2.2 Anechoic chamber method with multiprobe configuration

Inter-Lab/Inter-Technique (IL/IT) campaigns have been performed in CTIA
MOSG LTE MIMO OTA by the Anechoic Chamber test methodology. The results
are produced here in Figures 10.2.2-1 to 10.2.2-9.

Figure 10.2.2-2: Absolute data throughput framework results for the SCME
UMa-B Channel model\
for SATIMO

Further, from Figure 10.2.2-2, it can be noted that the max deviation
between the absolute data throughput and OTA measurements is around
1.5dB at 70% throughput. This can be observed for the Good antenna
system and SCME UMi case with the absolute data throughput outperforming
the OTA measurements. There is also a deviation of around 1dB for the
following case - SCME UMi with Nominal antenna and SCME UMa B case with
Good antenna.\
Very little deviation is noted for the Bad antenna and both SCME UMi,
and UMa B case.

10.3 3GPP harmonization test campaign
-------------------------------------

### 10.3.1 Description of the test plan

The objective of the harmonization measurement campaign is to capture
comparable data from the different MIMO OTA methodologies, whose
procedures are described in Clause 12, and to draw conclusions based on
this data on the ability to harmonize across two or more methodologies.

The free space (FS) testing condition is used in this measurement
campaign.

1\. Eight device orientations are used for testing with the MPAC and RTS
methodologies. With the vertical portrait orientation defined as (0,0,0)
of (yaw, pitch, roll), these are:Portrait - (0°, 0°, roll)

2\. Portrait tilt down - (0°, -45°, roll)

3\. Portrait tilt up - (0°, 45°, roll)

4\. Face up - (0°, 90°, roll)

5\. Face down - (0°, -90°, roll)

6\. Landscape - (90°, 0°, roll)

7\. Landscape tilt down - (90°, -45°, roll)

8\. Landscape tilt up - (90°, 45°, roll),

where the roll is represented by the rotation around the turntable axis
to produce a single cut.

For MPAC and RTS methodologies ***a c***omplete Throughput versus Power
curve is obtained over 12 azimuth angles per device orientation. The
total number of subframes (TNS) per power step is 20,000 to enable
post-processing of the result using the agreed FoM working assumptions.

For RC and RC+CE, device orientation is not applicable, but the
following other conditions apply. At least 100 samples and 400 subframes
per power step and sample (giving a total of 40,000 TNS per power step)
are be measured to enable post-processing of the results using the FoM
working assumptions. Additionally, an MU analysis on the TNS will be
completed by measuring all the devices with at least 100 samples and
20,000 subframes per power step and sample (giving a total of
TNS=2,000,000 per power step), with the aim of validating the use of the
small number of subframes through a comparison of their final averaged
outage values. Results for both stepwise and continuous stirring modes
are measured.

For any method, the power step is 0.5 dB from 95% down to 60%.

The following channel models are emulated by the different
methodologies:

RC: NIST channel model (Table C.2-3)

RC+CE: Short delay spread low correlation (SDLC; Table C.2-1) and long
delay spread high correlation (LDHC; Table C.2-2)

MPAC: SCMe UMi (Table 8.2-1) and SCMe UMa (Table 8.2-2)

RTS: SCMe UMi (Table 8.2-1) and SCMe UMa (Table 8.2-2)

The following is the working assumption on the figure of merit to be
used for the analysis of harmonization testing campaign results:

Option 1: statistic of outages per throughput curve

Option 2: outage point from the average throughput curve

In addition to these procedures, each methodology also performs absolute
data throughput framework tests in order to derive the measurement
uncertainty bound for harmonization (as defined in Clause 10.3.3). The
AC methodologies utilize a single free space portrait 90⁰ device
orientation, with the MIMO reference antenna placed at 90⁰ elevation,
and the RF enclosure door facing the 0⁰ azimuth. The RC test
methodologies conduct their measurements in stepstirred mode only. The
lab performing RC and RC+CE methodologies can determine the optimal
number of subframes per stirring state and per power level for the ADTF
analysis only. All methodologies use the channel models defined in
Clauses 8.2 and Annex C. ADTF results for each methodology, band, and
channel model include 5 conducted ADTF results and 5 radiated results.
The ADTF repeatability results for the MPAC methodology were impacted by
additional measurement uncertainty due to re-cabling and test system
re-configuration during the repeatability testing period.

based on the total number of devices used in determining the residuals
is provided in Table 10.3.3-1 below.

For each option, each band, and each pair of methodologies (i.e.
MPAC/RC, MPAC/RC+CE, and MPAC/RTS), harmonization offsets are selected
and harmonization residuals are calculated. Table 10.3.4-2 below lists
the harmonized MU terms (h), within the parameters of each option. In
this table the inter-methodology offsets were optimized across the
measurements obtained from device set 1 and device set 2 at 70%
throughput. For Option K the RC+CE testing procedure utilized 120
stirring states with 400 subframes per stirring state.

8\. Study how to calculate the cost and threshold

### 10.3.5a Harmonization outcome with device set 3

RAN4 has reviewed harmonization analyses and has drawn the following
conclusions regarding the MPAC/RC+CE harmonization outcome:

1\. For the TDD bands tested in the MPAC/RC+CE harmonization, the
harmonization cost varies between 0.37 and 0.60 dB. This harmonization
cost is within the lowest harmonization target for all TDD bands
considering the statistical significance. Because only 3 devices were
used to determine the offsets, harmonization between MPAC and RC+CE for
Bands 38 and 41 should be further investigated. Testing 5 more devices
in the chosen TDD bands in Lab3 can help to evaluate the harmonization
offsets and the harmonization cost for TDD.

2\. For all FDD bands tested in the MPAC/RC+CE harmonization, the
harmonization cost varies between 1.19 and 2.58 dB; some bands exceed
their highest harmonization bound and, therefore, harmonization between
MPAC and RC+CE cannot be confirmed for all FDD bands based on the
results available from the harmonization testing campaign.

3\. The potential to harmonize in FDD has been observed by isolating
devices which have contributed to higher residual errors, particularly
LNA-active devices, defining the related applicability criteria, and
investigating more suitable RC+CE settings and harmonization formulas.

RAN4 has reviewed harmonization analyses and has drawn the following
conclusions regarding the MPAC/RTS harmonization outcome:

1\. For the FDD bands tested in the MPAC/RTS harmonization, the
harmonization cost varies between 0.5 and 0.92 dB. This harmonization
cost is within the harmonization target for all bands and, therefore,
harmonization between MPAC and RTS for Bands 13, 5, 3, and 7 can be
confirmed.

2\. Considering the positive outcome of the MPAC/RTS harmonization
analysis, the following applicability criteria for the MPAC/RTS
harmonization are proposed based on the current understanding of the RTS
methodology capabilities:

a\. The harmonized RTS system is a two probe system capable of measuring
devices with two Rx antennas. Devices with more Rx antennas are not
supported.

b\. The RTS method is only applicable to devices which do not change
their antenna pattern in response to the radio environment.

c\. The RTS method requires device support for the antenna test function
(ATF) defined in TR 36.978. The ATF access of devices depends on the
support of chip vendors.

d\. There are two methods defined for ATF access, L3 signalling or a
vendor-supplied device app. The devices used for harmonization were all
modified to install the special ATF application. Harmonization has been
confirmed using devices with the special ATF application. Harmonization
for unmodified devices using the L3 access has not been confirmed.

e\. RTS is harmonized for FDD bands. TDD harmonization has not been
evaluated.

f\. Harmonization measurements for RTS were performed with correlation
based channel models; harmonization and channel model validation limits
would need to be confirmed for geometric based channel models.

### 10.3.5b Harmonization outcome with device set 4

In view of the applicability statements in subclause 10.3.5a relating to
the evaluation of L3 access and TDD, two further devices were evaluated.

vendor-supplied device app. Harmonization has been confirmed using
devices with the special ATF application and using the L3 access for

submission of the channel model validation data is not required.

If the lab implements a commercial test solution for which the test
solution provider has not yet submitted channel model validation data to
RAN4, then the channel model validation data shall be provided by the
solution provider. If the lab implements a custom test solution, then
the lab (as the test solution provider) shall provide channel model
validation data to RAN4, such that

\- The measurements are made according to the procedures described in
Clause 8.3 of TR 37.977

\- Using the channel models defined in 8.1.1 of TS 37.144

\- The results are submitted to RAN4 as a CR to TR 37.977

\- The testing frequencies are the center frequencies corresponding to
LTE bands 13 and 7

### 10.4.3 Calibration with a specific set of reference dipoles

### 12.1.6 Test procedure

#### 12.1.6.1 Initial conditions

Initial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE shall be
tested in and the steps for the SS to take with the UE to reach the
correct measurement state for each test case.

1\. Ensure environmental requirements of Annex A are met.

2\. Configure the test system according to Clauses 12.1.1 and 12.1.2 for
the applicable test case.

3\. Verify the implementation of the channel model as specified in
Clause 12.1.2.

NOTE: The verification of the channel model implementation can be part
of the laboratory accreditation process i.e. performed once for each
channel model, and will remain valid as long as the setup and
instruments remain unchanged. Otherwise the channel model validation may
need to be performed prior to starting each throughput test.

4\. Position the UE in the chamber according to Clause 12.1.3.

5\. Power on the UE.

6\. Set up the connection.

#### 12.1.6.2 Test procedure

performance of the DUT:

1\. Measure MIMO OTA throughput from one measurement point. MIMO OTA
throughput is the minimum downlink power (or SIR) resulting in a
throughput value of 70% and 95% of the maximum theoretical throughput.
The downlink power (or SIR) step size shall be no more than 0.5 dB when
RF power level is near the LTE MIMO sensitivity level. Measurement
duration shall be sufficient to achieve statistical significance that is
TBD.

NOTE 1: The initial RS EPRE can be set to the user\'s freely selectable
level.\
Recommended initial RS EPRE is found in Tables 7.1-1 and 7.1-2. For the

the target SIR values can be achieved when utilizing the SIR validation
procedure defined in clause 5.1.2.1.

NOTE 2: The throughput value target DL power level (or SIR) can be
changed using user\'s freely selectable algorithm.

NOTE 3: Assuming that the default signal level meets the criteria in
NOTE 1, the interference level will be adjusted to achieve the target
SIR.

NOTE 4: For devices that do not reach target TP, the highest RS EPRE at
which TP is measured shall be -80 dBm/15 kHz. The starting RS EPRE level
of the LTE MIMO sensititivity level search does not need to be specified
(NOTE 1)

NOTE 5: For devices that exhibit non-linear TP behaviour and that
achieve target throughput at multiple RF power levels, LTE MIMO
sensititivity level is chosen to be lowest measured DL power level which
crosses the target throughput level

2\. Rotate the UE around vertical axis of the test system by 30 degrees
and repeat from step 1 until one complete rotation has been measured
i.e. 12 different UE azimuth rotations.

3\. Repeat the test from step 1 for each specified device orientation. A
list of orientations is given in Annex E.

configuration, therefore is unique for each implementation. The
calibration procedure shall be documented by each lab, with enough
details to allow third party verification. Examples for signal level
calibration are given in Annex F.

### 12.2.5 Figure of Merit

The performance metric is given in Clause 5.

### 12.2.6 Test procedure

#### 12.2.6.1 Initial conditions

Initial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE shall be
tested in and the steps for the SS to take with the UE to reach the
correct measurement state for each test case.

1\. Ensure environmental requirements of Annex A are met.

2\. Configure the test system according to Clauses 12.2.1 and 12.2.2 for
the applicable test case.

3\. Verify the implementation of the channel model as specified in
Clause 12.2.2.

NOTE: The verification of the channel model implementation can be part

instruments remain unchanged. Otherwise the channel model validation may
need to be performed prior to starting each throughput test.

4\. Position the UE in the chamber according to Clause 12.2.3.

5\. Power on the UE.

6\. Set up the connection.

#### 12.2.6.2 Test procedure

The following steps shall be followed in order to evaluate MIMO OTA
performance of the DUT:

1\. Generate a test signal by the SS. The SS transmits the signal
through the test system to the DUT.

2\. Search for the minimum average DL RS ERPE (or SIR) level resulting
in a MIMO OTA throughput of at least 70 % of the maximum theoretical
throughput. The measurement procedure shall be based on sending a
pre-defined number of subframes for each throughput sample for each DL
RS EPRE (or SIR) level. When all samples have been collected for a
specific DL RS EPRE (or SIR) level, the procedure is repeated for other
DL RS EPRE (or SIR) levels. Alternatively, the search can be performed
for each stirring combination and then average the RS EPRE (or SIR)
levels when all throughput samples have been collected.

NOTE 1: The initial RS EPRE (or SIR) can be set to the user\'s freely
selectable level.\
Recommended initial RS EPRE is found in Tables 7.1-1 and 7.1-2. For the
SIR control tests, ensure that the default signal level is set such that
the target SIR values can be achieved when utilizing the SIR validation
procedure defined in clauses 5.1.2.2 and 5.1.2.3.

NOTE 2: To meet the throughput value target DL RS EPRE (or SIR) level
can be changed using user\'s freely selectable algorithm.

NOTE 3: The average throughput calculated from all samples collected for
each RS EPRE (or SIR) level is reported as the MIMO OTA throughput.

NOTE 4: The downlink RS EPRE (or SIR) step size shall be no more than
0.5 dB, when RF power level is near the MIMO OTA throughput sensitivity
level.

NOTE 5: Assuming that the default signal level meets the criteria in
NOTE 1, the interference level will be adjusted to achieve the target
SIR.

3\. The minimum average DL RS EPRE (or SIR) level that results in a MIMO
OTA throughput of at least 70 % of the maximum theoretical throughput
shall be reported.

### 12.3.6 Test procedure {#test-procedure-4 .list-paragraph}

#### 12.3.6.1 Initial conditions

Initial conditions are a set of test configurations the UE shall be
tested in and the steps for the SS to take with the UE to reach the
correct measurement state for each test case.

1\. Ensure environmental requirements of Annex A are met.

2\. Configure the test system according to Clauses 12.3.1 and 12.3.2 for
the applicable test case.

3\. Verify the implementation of the channel model as specified in
Clause 12.3.2.

NOTE: The verification of the channel model implementation can be part
of the laboratory accreditation process i.e. performed once for each
channel model, and will remain valid as long as the setup and
instruments remain unchanged. Otherwise the channel model validation may
need to be performed prior to starting each throughput test.

4\. Position the UE in the chamber according to Clause 12.3.3.

5\. Power on the UE.

6\. Set up the connection.

#### 12.3.6.2 Test procedure

The following steps shall be followed in order to evaluate MIMO OTA
performance of the DUT:

1\. Measure the DUT complex antenna pattern at a nominal -60 dBm
downlink power as described in subclause 6.3.1.3 first stage.

2\. Select an appropriate orientation from the measured antenna pattern
and establish a radiated MIMO connection to the DUT using the V and H
probes as described in subclause 6.3.1.3 second stage. Measure the
transmission matrix in the chamber and apply the inverse matrix to the
MIMO signal. The DUT orientation at which this is done is selected to
optimize the achievable isolation. The unknown gain of the DUT antennas
represented by the absolute accuracy of the RSAP measurement is then
de-embedded from the measured antenna pattern. This is done by comparing
the RSAP measurement from the first stage at the orientation being used
in the second stage, to a second RSAP measurement made in the second
stage using a nominal signal of -60 dBm adjusted by the uncorrected
antenna gain for that orientation. The difference in the RSAP
measurements represents the true antenna gain for that orientation.

3\. With the desired channel model applied, measure the isolation in dB
between each stream as seen by the DUT receiver and ensure it is at
least 15 dB averaged over at least 200 RSAP measurements.

4\. Using the calibrated radiated connection validate monotonicity of
the DUT RSAP and RSARP measurements over the range -60 dB, to -80 dBm
and +/- 180 degrees. The step size for RSAP shall be \[1\] dB and the
step size for RSARP shall be \[5\] degrees.

5\. Once monotonicity has been validated, check the linearity of RSAP at
the orientation of the peak antenna gain over the range -60 dBm to -80
dBm is \< \[1\] dB. Check the linearity of RSARP is within \[5\] degrees
over the range +/= 180 degrees. If the uncorrected RSAP or RSARP results
do not meet the linearity requirements, calculate and apply a transfer
function to the measured patterns to ensure the necessary linearity.

6\. Convolve the antenna patterns from stage 1, linearized if necessary,
with the channel model in the channel emulator and perform the
throughput test.

7\. Record the throughput for each DUT orientation controlled by the
channel emulator and each RS EPRE level.

8\. Identify and report the RS EPRE (or SIR) level achieving 70%
throughput for averaged throughput.

NOTE 1: The initial RS EPRE can be set to the user\'s freely selectable
level.\
Recommended initial RS EPRE is found in Tables 7.1-1 and 7.1-2. For the
SIR control tests, ensure that the default signal level is set such that
the target SIR values can be achieved when utilizing the SIR validation
procedure defined in clause 5.1.2.4.

NOTE 2: To meet the throughput value target DL RS EPRE level can be
changed using user\'s freely selectable algorithm.

NOTE 3: Assuming that the default signal level meets the criteria in
NOTE 1, the interference level will be adjusted to achieve the target
SIR.

######### Annex A: eNodeB Emulator Downlink power verification

A.1 Introduction
================

The measurements described in this clause serve three primary purposes;
to confirm that:

1\) the PDSCH total power is balanced between the MIMO transmit ports of
an eNodeB emulator;

2\) the PDCCH-EPRE vs. PDSCH-EPRE is balanced per eNodeB emulator
antenna port within a given RB;

3\) the RS-EPRE vs. PDSCH-EPRE ratio is correct per eNodeB emulator
antenna port within a given RB.

A.2 Test prerequisites
======================

The parameters specified in Table A.1-1 and Table A.1-2 below are based
on the eNodeB emulator settings described in Table 7.1-1 and Table
7.1-2.

A.3 Test Methodology
====================

For the purpose of verifying channel power levels called for in this
document, the eNodeB emulator shall be connected to a test UE (DUT)
according to the configuration shown in Figure A.3-1 below:

![](media/image158.png)

NOTE 1: TX Port \#1 is used as transmit-only on eNodeB emulators with a
separate uplink RX port.

NOTE 2: If the eNodeB emulator supports full duplex operation on TX port
\#1, the circulator\'s RX port shall be terminated in a 50 Ohm load.

NOTE 3: These splitter ports will be used to provide a downlink RF
sample to the analyzer and shall be terminated in a 50 Ohm load when not
in use.

Figure A.3-1: eNodeB Connections for Downlink Power Verification

The analyzer shown in Figure A.3-1 above must be capable of measuring
the eNodeB emulator\'s average PDCCH power independent of the eNodeB
emulator\'s average PDSCH power, expressed as a PSD in dBm/15 kHz.\
The analyzer must also be capable of measuring RS EPRE and PDSCH EPRE in
dBm/15 kHz.\
Any instrument capable of making these measurements is acceptable.

**The following eight measurements shall be made while the UE is in an
active data session and sending continuous uplink data to the eNodeB
emulator using the settings described in Table A.1-1 and Table A.1-2:**

1\) Average power at TX Port 1 (through Splitter 1) of all PDCCH RBs
expressed as a PSD in dBm/15 kHz

2\) Average power at TX Port 1 (through Splitter 1) of all PDSCH RBs
expressed as a PSD in dBm/15 kHz

3\) PDSCH-EPRE at TX Port 1 (through Splitter 1) in dBm/15 kHz

4\) RS-EPRE at TX Port 1 (through Splitter 1) in dBm/15 kHz for the
Reference Signals in DL

5\) Average power at TX Port 2 (through Splitter 2) of all PDCCH RBs
expressed as a PSD in dBm/15 kHz

6\) Average power at TX Port 2 (through Splitter 2) of all PDSCH RBs
expressed as a PSD in dBm/15 kHz

7\) PDSCH-EPRE at TX Port 2 (through Splitter 2) in dBm/15 kHz

8\) RS-EPRE at TX Port 2 (through Splitter 2) in dBm/15 kHz

**From the eight measurements described above, calculate the
following:**

● eNodeB TX Port 1/TX Port 2 PDCCH average power balance (in dB) across
all DL RBs

● eNodeB TX Port 1/TX Port 2 PDSCH average power balance (in dB) across
all DL RBs

● eNodeB RS-EPRE to PDSCH-EPRE power ratio (in dB), TX Port 1

● eNodeB RS-EPRE to PDSCH-EPRE power ratio (in dB), TX Port 2

**To be considered compliant with 3GPP TS 36.521-1** \[12\]**, the
following criteria must be met:**

a\. eNodeB PDCCH-EPRE TX Port1/TX Port 2 power balance must be\
0 dB, +/- 0.7 dB

b\. eNodeB PDSCH-EPRE TX Port 1/TX Port 2 power balance must be\
0 dB, +/- 0.7 dB

c\. eNodeB PDCCH-EPRE to PDSCH-EPRE TX Port 1 power ratio must be\
0 dB, +/- 0.7 dB

d\. eNodeB PDCCH-EPRE to PDSCH-EPRE TX Port 2 power ratio must be\
0 dB, +/- 0.7 dB

**In addition, the following criteria must be met per antenna based on
the** PDSCH EPRE power offset relative to\
RS EPRE called for in Table A.1-1 **and Table A.1-2:**

e\. eNodeB RS-EPRE to PDSCH-EPRE ratio must be +3 dB, +/- 0.7 dB\
for TX Port 1

f\. eNodeB RS-EPRE to PDSCH-EPRE ratio must be +3 dB, +/- 0.7 dB\
for TX Port 2

NOTE 1: 0dB if fading for RTS is done in baseband; same as RC&CE and
MPAC if fading is not in baseband

NOTE 2: assumption is that MU set to 0dB with channel model validation
pass/fail limits (FFS) that have negligible impact on TP FOM; MU for
channel model validation is FFS

NOTE 3: Analysis of the element associated with stirring method and
number of subframes is based on existing harmonization test campaign
data and can be further augmented by additional measurements. The
following combinations of stirring modes and number of subframes have
been identified as common use cases with the following standard
uncertainties (different combinations require separate validation):

A: stepped stirring mode with 20k SF per stirring state: 0dB

B: stepped stirring mode with 400 SF per stirring state: 0.22dB

C: continuous stirring mode with 20k SF per sample: FFS

D: continuous stirring mode with 400 SF per sample: FFS

Until MU elements for continuous stirring modes have been defined, the
test plan shall only consider stepped stirring approach

NOTE 4: As the applicability of SIR to MIMO OTA performance evaluation
is FFS, the measurement uncertainty treatment for SIR related items will
remain FFS. When the applicability of SIR is confirmed, the measurement
uncertainty treatment defined in 3GPP TS 36.521-1 \[12\] Table F.1.4-1
for line item 8.2.1.3.1 should be considered along with the related test
system constraints. Any adjustments to the test system limits or
uncertainty definitions necessary for MIMO OTA performance testing
should be applied.

NOTE 1: 0dB if fading for RTS is done in baseband; same as RC&CE and
MPAC if fading is not in baseband

NOTE 2: assumption is that MU set to 0dB with channel model validation
pass/fail limits (FFS) that have negligible impact on TP FOM; MU for
channel model validation is FFS

NOTE 3: Analysis of the element associated with stirring method and
number of subframes is based on existing harmonization test campaign
data and can be further augmented by additional measurements. The
following combinations of stirring modes and number of subframes have
been identified as common use cases with the following standard
uncertainties (different combinations require separate validation):

A: stepped stirring mode with 20k SF per stirring state: 0dB

B: stepped stirring mode with 400 SF per stirring state: 0.22dB

C: continuous stirring mode with 20k SF per sample: FFS

D: continuous stirring mode with 400 SF per sample: FFS

Until MU elements for continuous stirring modes have been defined, the
test plan shall only consider stepped stirring approach

NOTE 4: As the applicability of SIR to MIMO OTA performance evaluation
is FFS, the measurement uncertainty treatment for SIR related items will
remain FFS. When the applicability of SIR is confirmed, the measurement
uncertainty treatment defined in 3GPP TS 36.521-1 \[12\] Table F.1.4-1
for line item 8.2.1.3.1 should be considered along with the related test
system constraints. Any adjustments to the test system limits or
uncertainty definitions necessary for MIMO OTA performance testing
should be applied.

NOTE 1: 0dB if fading for RTS is done in baseband; same as RC&CE and
MPAC if fading is not in baseband

NOTE 2: assumption is that MU set to 0dB with channel model validation
pass/fail limits (FFS) that have negligible impact on TP FOM; MU for
channel model validation is FFS

NOTE 3: Analysis of the element associated with stirring method and
number of subframes is based on existing harmonization test campaign
data and can be further augmented by additional measurements. The
following combinations of stirring modes and number of subframes have
been identified as common use cases with the following standard
uncertainties (different combinations require separate validation):

A: stepped stirring mode with 20k SF per stirring state: 0dB

B: stepped stirring mode with 400 SF per stirring state: 0.22dB

C: continuous stirring mode with 20k SF per sample: FFS

D: continuous stirring mode with 400 SF per sample: FFS

Until MU elements for continuous stirring modes have been defined, the
test plan shall only consider stepped stirring approach

NOTE 4: As the applicability of SIR to MIMO OTA performance evaluation
is FFS, the measurement uncertainty treatment for SIR related items will
remain FFS. When the applicability of SIR is confirmed, the measurement
uncertainty treatment defined in 3GPP TS 36.521-1 \[12\] Table F.1.4-1
for line item 8.2.1.3.1 should be considered along with the related test
system constraints. Any adjustments to the test system limits or
uncertainty definitions necessary for MIMO OTA performance testing
should be applied.

NOTE 1: 0dB if fading for RTS is done in baseband; same as RC&CE and
MPAC if fading is not in baseband

NOTE 2: assumption is that MU set to 0dB with channel model validation
pass/fail limits (FFS) that have negligible impact on TP FOM; MU for
channel model validation is FFS

NOTE 3: Analysis of the element associated with stirring method and
number of subframes is based on existing harmonization test campaign
data and can be further augmented by additional measurements. The
following combinations of stirring modes and number of subframes have
been identified as common use cases with the following standard
uncertainties (different combinations require separate validation):

A: stepped stirring mode with 20k SF per stirring state: 0dB

B: stepped stirring mode with 400 SF per stirring state: 0.22dB

C: continuous stirring mode with 20k SF per sample: FFS

D: continuous stirring mode with 400 SF per sample: FFS

Until MU elements for continuous stirring modes have been defined, the
test plan shall only consider stepped stirring approach

NOTE 4: As the applicability of SIR to MIMO OTA performance evaluation
is FFS, the measurement uncertainty treatment for SIR related items will
remain FFS. When the applicability of SIR is confirmed, the measurement
uncertainty treatment defined in 3GPP TS 36.521-1 \[12\] Table F.1.4-1
for line item 8.2.1.3.1 should be considered along with the related test
system constraints. Any adjustments to the test system limits or
uncertainty definitions necessary for MIMO OTA performance testing
should be applied.

B.6 Fading channel emulator output uncertainty
==============================================

In the case where a fading channel emulator is used, the outputs of the
fading channel emulator are used to drive signals through the
amplifiers, if necessary, to the probe antennas in the MIMO OTA tests
either as an absolute level or as a relative level. The receiving device
used is a UE. Generally, an uncertainty contribution comes from the
absolute level accuracy, non-linearity, and output signal stability of
the fading channel emulator. All of the contributions should be
considered. However, the applicability of each contribution is
contingent on the specific measurement implementation and calibration
procedure.

This uncertainty should be determined from the manufacturer's data sheet
expressed in dB with a rectangular distribution, unless otherwise
informed (see clause 5.1.2 in \[6\]). Furthermore, the uncertainty of
the non-linearity and the output signal stability of the device may be
included in the absolute level uncertainty. If not, the non-linearity,
output signal stability and output signal stability versus temperature
should be determined from the manufacturer's data sheet. Once
determined, the non-linearity uncertainty and the output signal
stability uncertainties should be combined with the output uncertainty
using the RSS method.

B.7 External Amplifiers Uncertainty Terms
=========================================

Any components in the setup can potentially introduce measurement
uncertainty. It is then needed to determine the uncertainty contributors
associated with the use of such components. For the case of external
amplifiers, the following uncertainties should be considered but the
applicability is contingent to the measurement implementation and
calibration procedure.

B.7.1 Stability
---------------

An uncertainty contribution comes from the output level stability of the
amplifier. Even if the amplifier is part of the system for both
measurement and calibration, the uncertainty due to the stability shall
be considered. This uncertainty can be either measured or determined by
the manufacturers' data sheet for the operating conditions in which the
system will be required to operate.

B.7.2 Linearity
---------------

An uncertainty contribution comes from the linearity of the amplifier
since in most cases calibration and measurements are performed at two
different input/output power levels. This uncertainty can be either
measured or determined by the manufacturers' data sheet.

B.7.3 Noise Figure
------------------

When the signal goes into an amplifier, noise is added so that the SNR
at the output is reduced with regard to the SNR of the signal at the
input. This added noise introduces error on the signal which affects the
Error Rate of the receiver thus the EVM (Error Vector Magnitude). An
uncertainty can be calculated through the following formula:

![](media/image159.png)

where SNR is the signal to noise ratio in dB at the signal level used
during the sensitivity measurement.

B.7.4 Mismatch
--------------

If the external amplifier is used for both stages, measurement and
calibration the uncertainty contribution associated with it can be
considered systematic and constant -\> 0dB. If it is not the case, the
mismatch uncertainty at its input and output shall be either measured or
determined by the method described in \[11\].

B.7.5 Gain
----------

If the external amplifier is used for both stages, measurement and
calibration the uncertainty contribution associated with it can be
considered systematic and constant -\> 0dB. If it is not the case, this
uncertainty shall be considered.

######### Annex C: Other Environmental Test conditions for consideration

C.1 Scope
=========

**This annex contains non standard channel models which are described
for evaluation purposes.\
Approved channel models are described in Clause 4.2.**

C.2 3D isotropic Channel Models
===============================

This clause proposes three 3D isotropic channel models. One of the
models is based on the NIST channel model and two of the models are
based on the temporal aspects and Base Station (BS) correlation
properties of the SCME UMi and SCME UMa channel models.

The proposed 3D isotropic channel models are not directly based on real
life operating conditions, rather, are an attempt to model the
properties of the reverberation chamber which has been shown to
represent a statistically isotropic environment provided sufficient
averaging is performed using mode stirring. The instantaneous conditions
within the reverberation chamber are not isotropic.

The following 3D isotropic model is based on the PDP and BS correlation
of the SCME Urban Micro-cell model with isotropic AoAs and modified XPR
values and Velocity.

The following 3D isotropic model is based on the NIST model with
isotropic AoAs and added XPR values and Velocity. The cluster model
described below is a simplification of the full model, where a
continuous exponential decaying power transfer function with an RMS
delay spread of 80 ns is obtained.

The parameters of the channel models are the expected parameters for the
MIMO OTA channel models.\
However, the final channel model achieved for different methods could be
a combined effect of the chamber and the channel emulator.

The Rayleigh fading may be implementation specific. However, the fading
can be considered to be appropriate as long as the statistics of the
generated Rayleigh fading are within standard requirement on Rayleigh
fading statistics.

 C.3 Verification of Channel Model implementations
=================================================

Channel Models have been specified in Clause C.2.\
This clause describes the MIMO OTA validation measurements, in order to
ensure that the channel models are correctly implemented and hence
capable of generating the propagation environment, as described by the
model, within a test area. Measurements are done mainly with a Vector
Network Analyzer (VNA) and a spectrum analyzer.

C.3.1 Measurement instruments and setup
---------------------------------------

The measurement setup includes the following equipment:

Table C.3.1-1: Measurement equipment list for the verification procedure

  Item   Quantity   Item
  ------ ---------- -----------------------
  1      1          Channel Emulator
  2      1          Signal Generator
  3      1          Spectrum Analyzer
  4      1          VNA
  5      1          Electric Dipole
  6      1          Wideband test antenna

### C.3.1.1 Vector Network Analyzer (VNA) setup

Most of the measurements are performed with a VNA. An example set of
equipment required for this set-up is shown in Figure C.3.1.1-1. VNA
transmits frequency sweep signals thorough the MIMO OTA test system.\
A test antenna, within the test area, receives the signal and VNA
analyzes the frequency response of the system.\
A number of traces (frequency responses) are measured and recorded by
VNA and analyzed by a post processing SW, e.g., Matlab. Special care has
to be taken into account to keep the fading conditions unchanged, i.e.
frozen, during the short period of time of a single trace measurement.
The fading may proceed only in between traces. This setup can be used to
measure PDP, BS antenna correlation, Rayleigh fading and Isotropy of the
Channel models defined in Clause C.2.

### C.3.1.2 Spectrum Analyzer (SA) setup

The Doppler spectrum is measured with a Spectrum Analyzer as shown in
Figure C.3.1.2-1. In this case a Signal generator transmits CW signal
through the MIMO OTA test system. The signal is received by a test
antenna within the test area. Finally the signal is analyzed by a
Spectrum Analyzer and the measured spectrum is compared to the target
spectrum. This setup can be used to measure Doppler Spectrum of the
Channel models defined in Clause C.2.

C.3.2 Validation measurements
-----------------------------

### C.3.2.1 Power Delay Profile (PDP)

This measurement checks that the resulting Power Delay Profile (PDP) is
as defined in the channel model.

**Method of measurement:**

Step the chamber stirring sequence and store traces from VNA
measurements at each step until the Number of Traces specified in Table
C.3.2.1-1 is obtained. For the RC+CE, also the channel model emulation
will be stepped for each VNA trace.

The VNA sampling should be such that independent samples of the channel
model impulse response are obtained. This is ensured if the effective
distance travelled by the UE between faded samples of the channel model
is as defined in the table below, regardless of the number of stirring
positions in the chamber stirring sequence. To accurately emulate the
longest PDP duration *t*~f~ of 5 μs, the relationship *N*/Span = *t*~f~
must be satisfied.

**Method of measurement result analysis:**

Measured VNA traces (frequency responses H(t,f)) are saved into a hard
drive. The data is read into, e.g., Matlab.\
The analysis is performed by taking the Fourier transform of each
frequency response.\
The resulting impulse responses h(t, *τ*) are averaged in power over
time (or samples):

Finally the resulting PDP is shifted in delay, such that the first tap
is on delay zero.\
The reference PDP plots from Table C.2-1, Table C.2-2 and Table C.2-3
are shown in Figure C.3.2.1-1.

In a reverberation chamber, when a channel emulator is not used and the
PDP is therefore an exponential decay, such as the NIST channel model,
only the inherent RMS Delay Spread of the reverberation chamber needs to
be calculated.\
The selection of the T *h~i~(t,τ)* measurements has to be performed when
the absorber loading technique is used to tune the RMS DS in an RC.
Alternatively, the sample selection technique allows for selecting a
subset of M *h~i~(t,τ)* measurements which provide the desired RMS DS,
and in this case the averaging has to be performed only over the
selected subset of M channel impulse responses.

The calculation of RMS delay spread is performed on the time domain data
as the square root of the second central moment of the PDP, that is:

Only PDP values above a threshold of -60 dB should be included in the
calculation of the RMS delay spread.

The expected RMS delay spread for the NIST channel model is 80 ns.

**OTA antenna configuration:** Fixed measurement source antenna.

**Measurement antenna:**

A suitable wideband test antenna.

**Tolerances:**

Performance bounds of (cluster power ±0.85dB and excess delay ±11ns).

### C.3.2.2 Doppler for 3D isotropic models

This measurement checks that the resulting is as defined in the channel
model.

Doppler.**Method of measurement:**

For Doppler validation, two methods could be used to measure the Doppler
spectrum. The first uses a CW tone from the Signal Generator fed
directly, or via the channel emulator if used, to the fixed measurement
antennas and is recorded by the spectrum analyzer. For the second
method, the input signal from the VNA is fed directly, or via the
channel emulator if used, to the fixed measurement antennas of the
chamber.

For the first method, a sine wave (CW, carrier wave) signal is
transmitted from the signal generator. The signal is connected from the
signal generator to the channel emulator via cables, or alternatively
directly fed to the chamber measurement antenna for the RC methodology.
For the RC+CE methodology, the channel emulator output signals are then
transferred via cables to the fixed measurement antennas (possibly via
amplifiers). The fixed measurement antennas radiate the signals over the
air to the test antenna. The Doppler spectrum is measured by the
spectrum analyzer having the stirring sequence and, if applicable, the
channel emulation active and the trace is saved. The signal generator
and the spectrum analyzer reference oscillators should be synchronized,
in order to minimize frequency shift etc.

Alternatively, the Doppler spectrum can be measured with a VNA.
Frequency sweeps are measured with the VNA for a complete stirring
sequence, thus collecting samples of the chamber transfer function for
each fixed stirrer position . To get a correct estimate of the Doppler
power spectrum, the spatial distance between the stirrer positions
should be small enough to satisfy Nyquist theorem. is Fourier
transformed according to

The Doppler spectrum can then be calculated using

The discrete Doppler power spectrum will now have a frequency axis
ranging from 0 to N-1, where N is the number of stirrer positions used.
To convert this into a Doppler frequency domain, the sampling theorem
gives a frequency axis in the interval \[,\], where

and the frequency step between each Doppler frequency sample is given by

is the time step between the measured samples.

**Method of Measurement Result Analysis:**

Calculate the square root of the second central moment of the Doppler
spectrum from center frequency to the frequency corresponding to -30 dB
(make sure that no noise is included in the calculations). Use the value
obtained (*Δf*) to calculate the equivalent speed (*Δv*) using the
following equation:

where *c* is the speed of light and *f~0~* is the carrier frequency.

The reference classical Doppler spectrum is shown in figure C.3.2.2-1.

the measurements.

### C.3.2.3 Base Station antenna correlation for 3D isotropic models

This measurement checks that the resulting Base Station (BS) antenna
correlation follows the computed values from the channel parameters
given in tables C.2-1, C.2-2 and C.2-3.

**Method of measurement:**

For correlation validation, the input signal from the VNA is fed
directly (for table C.2.-3), or via the channel emulator (for tables
C.2-1 and C.2-2), to the fixed measurement antennas of the reverberation
chamber.

Step the chamber stirring sequence and store traces from VNA
measurements at each step until the Number of Traces specified in Table
C.3.2.3-1 is obtained. For the RC+CE, also the channel model emulation
will be stepped for each VNA trace.

Each of the paths for the two transmit streams must be measured
separately using the procedure above. The samples for each path must be
taken for the exact same channel emulator and stirring positions.

The VNA sampling should be such that independent samples of the channel
model impulse response are obtained. This is ensured if the effective
distance travelled by the UE between faded samples of the channel model
is as defined in the table below.

The amplitude of the complex correlation averaged over the channel
bandwidth shall be within the interval 0.05 -- 0.2.

### C.3.2.4 Rayleigh fading

This measurement checks that the resulting fading of the MIMO OTA system
is Rayleigh as per the channel model.

**Method of measurement:**

For Rayleigh Fading validation, the input signal from the VNA is fed to
one of the two input ports of the channel emulator and further to the
fixed measurement transmit antennas of the reverberation chamber. The
same stirring sequence, number of active CE output ports, channel model
and CE channel model emulation as used for the DUT measurement, as well
as the chamber loading used for the DUT measurement and PDP validation,
should be used for the validation measurement.

In order to achieve statistical significance, the number of samples
should be \>1000. If the DUT stirring sequence has less than 1000 steps,
the number of measurements shall be increased proportionaly without
altering the fading envelope distribution. This is done reducing the CE
IR, and the stirring step by dividing them by an N value such as the
resultant number of measurements will be \> 1000 while keeping the same
amplitude distribution. e.g. if the stiring sequence has 120 steps, and
for every measurement the stirrers move equally 9 degrees, then using N
= 9 for 1080 samples will result in changing the stirring sequence to 1
degree per measurement for all the stirrers, and dividing the IR step by
9. If needed, the IR should be rounded to the closest integer.

Step the chamber stirring sequence and store traces from VNA
measurements at each step until the Number of Traces specified in Table
C.3.2.4-1 is obtained. For the RC+CE, also the channel model emulation
will be stepped for each VNA trace.

The VNA sampling should be such that independent samples of the channel
model impulse response are obtained. This is ensured if the effective
distance travelled by the UE between faded samples of the channel model
is as defined in the table below.

The procedure described above shall be performed in two of the extreme
test volume validation positions (TVVPs) defined in Annex G. Observe
that each TVVP consists of three orientations, which means that in total
6 Rayleigh validation measurements shall be performed and the results
from each of these measurements shall pass the limits. The same stirring
sequence, number of active CE output ports, channel model and CE channel
model emulation shall be used at each of the chosen TVVPs.

**Method of Measurement Results Analysis**

The primary performance criterion to evaluate Rayleigh fading is the
Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of the received signal amplitude
(x) at the DUT. CDF describes the probability of a signal level being
less than the CDF parameter. The CDF of x in a set of measured samples
in a reverberation chamber is defined as,

![](media/image180.emf)

Figure C.3.2.4-1: Reference Rayleigh distribution

The difference between the measured histogram of CDF (also known as
empirical CDF, ECDF) and ideal histogram is computed within the
framework of the Chi-Square test \[3\] to determine if the chamber
provides a Rayleigh fading. The Chi-Square test is a purely statistical
test for determining if the observed data ECDF follows the theoretic
CDF. The Chi-Square test is performed as follows \[21\].

1\. Partition the measured sample space (N samples) into K disjoint
intervals (bins).

2\. Calculate the number mi of samples that fall in each of these
intervals. This is a measure of the probability that the outcome will
fall in that interval.

3\. Compare the Rayleigh CDF obtained from the measured data to the
theoretical probability distribution using the Chi-Square test.

The Chi-Square statistic is defined as the "weighted square error" and
is given by

![](media/image181.png)

Here, N is the number of samples, pi is the theoretical probability of
landing in the bin with index i, and mi is the measured number of
samples in the bin with index i. K=15 shall be used for the validation.
The theoretical value pi is given in Table C.3.2.4-3 below.

Due to the statistical variations of the chi-squared value, the final
reported value should be obtained by averaging the chi-squared values
obtained for each frequency point in the signal bandwidth. This averaged
value should be compared to the limit.

distribution with 15 bins

  2.70805           +infinity         1/15

Note: These limits are given as Watt ratios.

According to \[22\], a chi-squared value less than or equal to 27.69
will mean that the numbers are Rayleigh distributed (1% significance
level).

It also needs to be verified that there is no strong LOS component
present. This is done by evaluating the ratio of the direct path
component to the scattered component (also known as K-factor). If there
is no direct component present, then K = 0, K = -∞ dB.

![](media/image182.png)

The maximum allowed K-factor is -10dB, anything higher than will be
considered a failure.

### C.3.2.5 Isotropy for 3D isotropic models

This measurement checks that the resulting received signal
characteristics are statistically spatially isotropic.

**Method of measurement:**

For isotropic validation, the input signal from the VNA is fed directly,
or via the channel emulator, to the fixed measurement antennas of the
reverberation chamber. If a channel emulator is used, it has to be
placed in Bypass mode where no fading is used. An electric dipole is
placed on the turn table.\
Three orthogonal components of the electric field are recorded with the
dipole in three different orientations. The same stirring sequence as
used for the DUT measurement, as well as the chamber loading used for
the DUT measurement and PDP validation, should be used for the
validation measurement.

Step the chamber stirring sequence and store traces from VNA
measurements at each step until the Number of Traces specified in Table
C.3.2.5-1 is obtained. Repeat this procedure with the dipole in all
three orthogonal orientations.

**Method of Measurement Results Analysis**

Compute and evaluate the anisotropy coefficients from the measured data
as described in \[2\]. Using S parameters, the anisotropy coefficient
that employs two orientations may be given as

A~pq~(n) = (\|S~21~,~p~(n)\|^2^-\| S~21~,~q~(n)\|^2^)/(\|
S~21~,~p~(n)\|^2^+\| S~21~,~q~(n)\|^2^),

where p \< q = 1, 2, 3. The total anisotropy coefficient that takes into
account all three orientations is given by

A~tot~(n)=sqrt{\[A~12~(n)\]^2^+\[A~13~(n)\]^2^+\[A~23~(n)\]^2^}/sqrt{3}.

The cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) for the ideal anisotropy
coefficients are shown in figure C.3.2.5-1, where the left plot applies
to Apq(n) and the right plot applies to Atot(n).

Figure C.3.2.5-1: Reference anisotropy coefficients for two orientations
(Apq) and for three orientations (Atot)

NOTE: These figures have been provided by the National Institute of
Standards and Technology in USA.

The differences between the measured CDF of Apq(n), Atot(n) and their
ideal CDF's are computed within the framework of the chi-square test
\[3\] to determine if the chamber is isotropic. The chi-square test is a
statistical test for determining whether the CDF of the observed data
for Apq(n), and Atot(n) are significantly different from the ideal. The
chi-square test is performed as follows \[21\].

1\. Sort the N measured values of Apq(n), and Atot into the K equal,
disjoint intervals (bins) specified in the first two columns of Table
C.3.2.5-1A and C.3.2.5-2, with K = 10, and K = 11 respectively.

2\. Count the number Mk of measured samples of Apq(n), and Atot that
fall in the kth interval. It is necessary that at least 5 measured
samples fall into each interval.

3\. For Apq(n) the numbers of samples per bin are equal, therefore p~i~
= N/10. For Atot(n) calculate the probability p~k~ of samples for each
bin from the ideal CDF in the kth interval. Table C.3.2.5-2 provides the
values of p~k~ for K = 11 bins.

4\. Compare the Mk with the expected number obtained from the ideal CDF
p~k~ using the chi-square test as follows.

> χ^2^=Σ(M~k~-Np~k~)^2^/(Np~k~).

The summation over bins goes from k=1 to K.

Due to the statistical variations of the chi-squared value, the final
reported value should be obtained by averaging the chi-squared values
obtained for each frequency point in the signal bandwidth. This averaged
value should be compared to the limit.

According to \[22\], a chi-squared value less than or equal to 21.67
will mean that the 2 orientation anisotropy coefficients, Apq(n), are
uniformly distributed as expected (1% significance level). For the Total
anisotropy coefficients, Atot(n), a chi-squared value less than or equal
to 23,21 will mean that the there is no significant difference from the
ideal reference (1% significance level).

C.4 Channel model validation results
====================================

Channel models have been specified in clause C.2.\
This clause describes the MIMO OTA validation measurements, in order to
ensure that the channel models are correctly implemented and hence
capable of generating the propagation environment, as described by the
model, within a test area. Measurements are done mainly with a Vector
Network Analyzer (VNA) and a spectrum analyzer.

C.4.1 Scope
-----------

Clauses C.4.2-C.4.6 contain the validation results of channel models in
Annex C.2 for companies using methods as described in Clause 6.3.2.
These results are based on two different types of equipment vendors and
both sets of results are included here for comparison.

C.4.2 Power Delay Profile (PDP) for 3D isotropic models
-------------------------------------------------------

The power delay profiles of the channel models in Annex C.2 have been
measured according to the procedures in Annex C.3.\
Figure C.4.2-1 below illustrates the measured results for Band 13 for
the isotropic channel model based on NIST for two different
reverberation chambers.\
Figure C.4.2-2 illustrates the measured results for Band 13 for the
short delay spread low correlation and long delay spread high
correlation isotropic channel models for two different reverberation
chambers and channel emulators.

### C.4.5.1 Setup used by harmonization test lab

The measurement procedures and data analysis align with Annex C.3.2.4.
The inherent RMS delay spread of the chamber (without channel emulator)
is 50 ns and 1080 stirring positions are used (one per VNA trace).

Table C.4.5.1-1 shows the chi-squared values calculated for two
different TVVPs (see Annex C.4.6.1) and three orientations for each TVVP
for the SDLC channel model at 751 MHz and 2655 MHz. As can be seen from
this table, the chi-squared value is within the limit (\< 27.69) for all
cases.

#########  Annex D: Environmental requirements

D.1 Scope
=========

The requirements in this clause apply to all types of UE(s) and MS(s).

D.2 Ambient temperature
=======================

All the MIMO OTA requirements are applicable in room temperature e.g.
25°C.

D.3 Operating voltage
=====================

The device under test shall be equipped with a real battery that is
fully charged (at the beginning of the test).

#########  Annex E: DUT orientation conditions

E.1 Scope
=========

This annex lists the testing environment conditions for all DUT types
relevant to MIMO OTA testing.\
The use cases (positioning) discussed here are applicable for all
methodologies, however the orientation and rotations described may be
applicable for some methodologies only, and not for some other
methodologies.

E.2 Testing environment conditions
==================================

Table E.2-1 below lists the testing environment conditions along with a
diagram and applicable references.

The reference coordinate system and orientation of devices in that
coordinate system is shown in Figure E.2-1 below, which includes the
mechanical alignment of a phone.\
For tablets the home button, charging connector and similar components
can be used to define top and bottom.\
For laptops the definitions specified in 3GPP TR 25.914 \[11\] (and
repeated here in Table E.2-1) are used.\
In the case of methodologies utilizing a spatial channel model in Figure
E.2-1, the X axis points towards the channel model reference. For
example in the case of an anechoic chamber utilizing 2D antenna array in
the azimuth plane\
(XY plane from Figure E.2-1) this is the direction of the first probe at
0 degrees as shown in Figure 6.3.1.2.1-2.

![](media/image214.emf)

Figure E.2-1: Reference coordinate system and reference device
orientation

First the terminology used below is defined here. Where possible
consistency with \[11\], \[17\], \[18\] and \[9\] is sought.

**Use Case (Position):** the use case (position) indicates how the DUT
is related to its environment. This includes the following example use
cases: free space, beside head, beside head and hand, hand only etc.\
Note that formerly this has been referred to as position in \[4\] as
well as in \[9\]. Since to date only isotropic metrics have been used
(TRP/TRS) the definition of positioning the device for a certain use
case has been equivalent to orienting it relative to the environment.
With the introduction of spatial channel models, the positioning for a
specific use case has to be separated from the actual orientation
relative to the spatial incoming signals. For some methodologies not
utilizing spatial channel models this distinction might not be
necessary.

**Orientation:** The orientation of the device in three dimensional
space is defined using the three Euler angles -- Ψ-yaw; Θ-pitch; Φ-roll
as defined in \[17\] and \[18\] and linked to the reference coordinate
systems and reference orientation from Figure E.2-1. Note that for most
use cases practical considerations of how to position the DUT together
with the phantom may determine the DUT orientation.

**Rotation:** Once positioned for a specific use case and oriented
within the reference coordinate system, the DUT and phantom are rotated
within the test zone to measure the performance under various spatial
channel illuminations. The rotation is defined with the same Euler
angles but expressed as vectors of equal size. An example is given
below:

EXAMPLE: Consider a DUT measured in an anechoic chamber as described in
Clause 6.\
To measure the free space use case in the YZ plane (see Table E.2-1) for
example at every 30 degrees the rotation vectors would be as follows:

Ψ = \[0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\] - a vector of 12 zeros indicating no
rotation from the reference position for any phi value below

Θ = \[-90 -90 -90 -90 -90 -90 -90 -90 -90 -90 -90 -90\] -- a vector of
12 values equal to -90 indicating a constant pitch of -90 degrees for
all phi values below

Φ = \[0 30 60 90 120 150 180 210 240 270 300 330\] -- a vector of 12
distinct rotations from the reference position representing a rotation
along the azimuth plane with a step of 30 degrees.

These vectors unambiguously define that the DUT is to be oriented with
the screen up and rotated in azimuth every 30 degrees.

The principal antenna pattern cuts (XY plane, XZ plane, and YZ plane)
are defined in \[17\].\
The XY plane cut corresponds to the absolute throughput testing
condition applied to the CTIA reference antennas for the IL/IT activity.
They XZ plane and YZ plane cuts are shown for completeness and are not
required for the absolute data throughput framework. The YZ plane cut
corresponds to a device positioned with its screen up in a USB/WLAN
tethering scenario and may be a useful testing point for handset devices
expected to achieve performance metrics under such usage conditions.

The Data Mode Portrait (DMP) conditions are defined in TR 25.914 \[11\],
and are included in this table for completeness. The Data Mode Landscape
(DML) testing conditions are not currently defined in any standard
testing methodology but benefit from a thorough treatment in academic
literature \[18\]. This testing condition considers free space for all
handset sizes until a DML phantom design becomes available, at which
time the testing condition will be revisited.

The Laptop Mounted Equipment (LME) and Laptop Embedded Equipment (LEE)
testing conditions are well defined in TR 25.914 \[11\] and constitute
an XY plane cut measurement, given the proper orientation of the lid of
the laptop ground plane phantom (in the case of LME) or of the laptop
itself (in the case of LEE).

Given a 2D ring of symmetrically distributed probes (as in Clause 6):

\- The XZ plane is similar to the DML mode except for the additional 45
degrees pitch in the DML casw

\- For the phantom case the tilt of the DML case is very relevant since
the interaction of the phantoms with the antennas will depend on it --
see Figure E.2-2

E.2.1 MPAC Positioning Guidelines
---------------------------------

In order for the anechoic chamber multi probe system to emulate the
intended propagation statistics within the region of space incident on
the DUT antennas, two concepts determine the associated antenna spacing
and positioning guidelines. The maximum antenna spacing in the DUT must
be within the limit determined by the anechoic chamber multi probe
system's ability to emulate the spatial correlation function, and the
power stability of the field incident on the DUT antennas must be
verified.

a)![](media/image228.emf)b) ![](media/image229.emf)

Figure E.2.1-1: Illustration of DUT antenna spacing and positioning
guidelines;\
a) guideline in this specification, b) example with DUT meeting the
maximum allowed antenna separation but not within the verified power
stability region

As the channel model validation procedures for spatial correlation as
defined in clause 8.3.2.3 are to be performed at the downlink center
frequency in 3GPP TS 36.508 \[19\], the maximum antenna spacing in the
DUT shall be defined by the wavelength per operating band center
frequency of the middle channel of the downlink at the band under test.
A verification of power stability can be derived from the spatial
correlation verification results in clause 8.3.2.3. Given that this
verification spans a region with a diameter of 1 wavelength centered on
the axis of rotation in the chamber and that the performance
demonstrated by multiple 8 dual-polarized probe MPAC implementations in
clause 8.4.4 has shown good alignment up to 0.85 lambda for SCME UMi,
the region where DUT antennas shall be placed (the MIMO OTA test zone)
shall be defined in the same way (see Figure E.2.1-1a above) but further
confined by the 0.85 lambda antenna separation limit for SCME UMi.
Figure E.2.1-1b above provides an example of a DUT meeting the maximum
allowed antenna separation but not within the verified power stability
region; this placement of a DUT shall not be used. The optimization of
the maximum allowed antenna spacing of the DUT and the verification of
the test zone, as well as SCME UMa considerations, are expected as part
of future work.

The region of uniform power delivered by the MIMO system (unverified) as
shown in Figure E.2.1-1 is an indication of the region where the
wavefront may maintain its uniformity. Therefore, it may be used to
extend the test volume but is not allowed at this time. It is considered
unverified because the validation of spatial correlation provides a
verification that spans a region of 1 lambda. Any further extension of
the verified test volume would require an update to the spatial
correlation validation in clause 8.3.2.3.

The DUT maximum antenna spacing and placement within the test zone shall
be defined by the following two-tier methodology due to the primary
radiation modes below 1 GHz and above 1 GHz and how they relate to the
device and/or antenna size.

When operating in frequency bands lower than 1GHz, the physical center
of the DUT shall be placed in the chamber center, the DUT shall be
completely contained within the volume defined by the respective
operating band equivalent to a sphere with a radius equal to 0.425
wavelength as defined in Tables E.2.1-1 and Tables E.2.1-2 for SCME UMi.

When operating in frequency bands higher than 1 GHz the equidistant
physical point between the DUT MIMO antenna system shall be placed in
the chamber center following guidance defined in Figure E.2-2 and the
DUT MIMO antenna system (further physical dimension or both antennas'
maximum E-field regions) shall be completely contained within the volume
defined by the respective operating band equivalent to a sphere with a
radius equal to 0.425 wavelength defined in Tables E.2.1-1 and Tables
E.2.1-2 for SCME UMi. The definition of the equidistant point between
the DUT MIMO antennas shall be provided through manufacturer declaration
for all operating bands where the maximum antenna separation requirement
has been met. The location of the equidistant point(s) for each
operating band shall be identified by the manufacturer by either marking
the device utilized for MIMO OTA testing or by providing clear
instructions to the test operator as to the physical location(s).

The two-tier approach is needed to be technically correct when defining
the MPAC test volume. While the geometric center can be used in
frequencies lower than 1GHz, the same methodology will add unnecessary
limitations for test applicability in frequencies above 1GHz. In this
case, manufacturers will need to provide further information to enable
the proper definition of the test volume. Ideally, the same approach
adopted in frequencies above 1 GHz could be used for all frequencies.
However, the extra positioning work and need to identify the equidistant
point between the DUT MIMO antennas isn\'t necessary for frequencies
under 1GHz since the wavelength dimension is large enough for all
handsets, phablets, and most tablets and laptops.

The positioning of the device under test within the test volume shall be
set as defined above and in Clause 9.4.

The environmental requirements for the device under test shall be set as
defined in Annex D.

E.2.2 RTS Positioning Guidelines and test zone dimensions
---------------------------------------------------------

For the RTS system, it can be seen from earlier analysis in the MU
budget in Annex B.2 that the MU elements related to device size are
linked to uncertainties in the field uniformity of the anechoic chamber
used for the first stage antenna pattern measurement. The RTS MU budget
was calculated with the assumption that the device size was within the
limits defined by the chamber quiet zone defined in TS 34.114 Annex
A2.3, TS 34.114 E.10 and as measured in TS 34.114 Annex G.2. The
applicable device size for RTS is therefore the same as used for SISO
TRS in the same chamber.

The second stage of the RTS method which involves a cable replacement
radiated connection, is assumed in the MU budget to take place in the
same anechoic chamber as was used for the first stage antenna pattern
measurement, and there are no additional test zone considerations
required. The use of a different chamber for the second stage is not
precluded, but would require a recalculation of the impact of any
difference between the anechoic chambers.

For device positioning within the test zone for the first stage the
normal positioning accuracy assumed in Table B.2-1 of 0.5 degrees is
considered insignificant compared to the raster used for the antenna
measurement.

For the second stage positioning impact, and with the assumption the
chamber is the same as used in the first stage, the issue is the
repeatability of the position used from the first stage. This is likely
to be less than the 0.5 degree absolute positioning error so is again
assumed to be negligible.

#########  Annex F: Calibration

F.1 Scope
=========

Here the absolute power level calibration in the center of the test zone
is described. Note that Clause 8.3 describes in detail the verification
process for the various channel models however in addition to that an
absolute power calibration needs to be performed as well. Note also that
the channel model validation and absolute power calibration may have
different renewal cycles.

F.2 Calibration Procedure -- Anechoic chamber method with multiprobe configuration
==================================================================================

The system needs to be calibrated in two steps in order to ensure that
the absolute power is correct. The first calibration steps ensures the
accurate generation of the channel model in the center of the chamber as
required by Clause 8.3.\
The second step validates the total power as would be seen by the DUT
and allows for that power to be scaled up or down if necessary.

Considering the complexity of the system various way to calibrate are
possible. The end goals are however the same no matter the exact
procedure. The two steps must achieve the following:

**Step 1:** This step is used to equalize the power in the center coming
from the different probes. This being a relative measurement is very
robust and with minimal uncertainty. It is sufficient to use instruments
calibrated according to the manufacturer\'s specifications and the
measurements require no additional calibration. This step is done for
both vertical and horizontal polarizations. The relative differences
between probe path losses are recorded and used (typically in the fading
emulator) to adjust the generated fading signals for each probe. Example
measurement set-up is shown in Figure 8.3.1.1-1.

NOTE 1: If Step 1 is performed as an absolute measurement accounting for
the cable and reference antenna gains Step 2 can be omitted.

**Step 2:** This step is used to measure the total absolute power of at
least one polarization in the center of the ring. Then assuming that
validation of the channel models has been done, the total power
available to the DUT in the center of the chamber can be computed. If
necessary the power can be scaled up or down to achieve the desired
power level. Since this is an absolute power measurement, the
measurement cable and reference antenna gains have to be accounted for.

NOTE 2: To minimize measurement uncertainty the passive and active
components of the system may be calibrated independently as well as at
different intervals.

NOTE 3: Step 2 of the calibration should be performed with the channel
model loaded and LTE signaling active. Sufficient amount of time
averaging is required because of the fading nature of the models used.

NOTE 4: Various ways of performing the two steps may exist depending on
the equipment used.\
The lab is responsible for providing a comprehensive calibration
procedure.

NOTE 5: Steps one and two may be combined with the channel verification
procedure.

NOTE 6: The calibration must be performed for all frequencies of
interest.

F.2.1 Example Calibration Procedure
-----------------------------------

The calibration procedure outlined below is only one possibility based
on a concrete measurement set-up. Improvements can be made to minimize
measurement uncertainty.

**Step 1:**

1\. Place a vertical reference dipole in the center of the chamber,
connected to a VNA port, with the other VNA port connected to the input
of the channel emulator unit -- Figure 8.3.1.1-1.

2\. Configure the channel emulator for bypass mode (NOTE this might not
be available in all instruments)

3\. Measure the response of each path from each vertical polarization
probe to the reference antenna in the center.

4\. Adjust the power on all vertical polarization branches of the
channel emulator so that the powers received at the center are equal.

5\. Repeat the steps 1 to 4 with the magnetic loop and horizontally
polarized probes instead, and adjust the horizontal polarization
branches of the channel emulator.

NOTE: At this stage all vertical polarization paths have equalized
gains, and so do all horizontal polarization paths. The two
polarizations however do not necessarily produce the same signal
strength in the center of the chamber -- this most commonly happens if
two physically different channel emulators are used for the two
polarizations. The resulting power imbalance can be accounted for either
at this step or adjusted at point 7 of step 2.

**Step 2 (see Figure F.2.1-1):**

1\. Place a vertical reference dipole in the center of the chamber
connected to a spectrum analyzer via an RF cable. NOTE: A power meter
can also be used.

2\. Record the cable and reference dipole gains.

3\. Load the target channel model

4\. Start the LTE signaling in the base station emulator with the
required parameter identical to the measurements conditions (some
special instrument options might be necessary).

5\. Average the power received by the spectrum analyzer for a sufficient
amount of time to account for the fading channel -- one full channel
simulation might be unnecessary.

6\. Repeat steps 1 to 4 with a magnetic loop for the horizontal
polarization (NOTE: this way no prior validation of the channel model is
required)

7\. Calculate the total power received at the test area as the sum of
the power in the two polarizations.

8\. Adjust the power in the two polarizations if necessary. The power
adjustment can be a simple scaling of the power up or down or adjustment
of the XPR due to slight differences in the fading unit\'s branches.
Depending on the adjustment needed, it can be done at the base station
emulator or the channel emulator or both.

F.3 Calibration Procedure -- Reverberation chamber method
=========================================================

The purpose of the calibration measurement is to determine the average
power transfer function in the chamber, mismatch of fixed measurement
antennas and path losses in cables connecting the power sampling
instrument and the fixed measurement antennas. Preferably a network
analyzer is used for these measurements. Recommended calibration
antennas are dipoles tuned to the frequency band of interest.

In general, the calibration of a reverberation chamber is performed in
three steps:

1\. Measurement of S-parameters through the reverberation chamber for a
complete stirring sequence

2\. Calculation of the chamber reference transfer function

3\. Measurement of connecting cable insertion loss

If several setups are used (e.g. empty chamber, chamber with head
phantom, etc.), steps 1 and 2 must be repeated for each configuration.
The calibration measurement setup can be studied in Figure F.3-1.

![](media/image231.png)

Figure F.3-1: Calibration measurement setup in the reverberation
chamber, using a vector network analyzer

F.3.1 Measurement of S-parameters through the chamber for a complete stirring sequence
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This step will measure S-parameters through the reverberation chamber
through a complete stirring sequence. This information is required to
determine the chamber\'s reference transfer function. The procedure must
be performed separately for each measurement setup of which the loading
of the chamber has been changed. The calibration procedure must be
repeated for each frequency as defined above. Therefore, it is
advantageous if the network analyzer can be set to a frequency sweep
covering the defined frequencies, so that all frequencies of interest
can be measured with a minimal number of measurement runs.

i\. Place all objects into the RC which will be used during the
throughput measurements, including a head phantom, hand phantom and
fixture for the EUT. This ensures that the loss in the chamber, which
determines the average power transfer level, is the same during both
calibration and test measurements. Also, if the EUT is large or contains
many antennas, it may represent a noticeable loading of the chamber. It
should then be present in the chamber and turned on during the
calibration.

ii\. Place the calibration antenna inside the chamber. The calibration
antenna is preferably mounted on a low-loss dielectric fixture, to avoid
effects from the fixture itself which may affect the EUT\'s radiation
efficiency and mismatch factor. The calibration antenna must be placed
in the chamber in such a way that it is far enough from any walls,
mode-stirrers, head phantom, or other object, such that the environment
for the calibration antenna (taken over the complete stirring sequence)
resembles a free space environment. \"Far enough away\" depends on the
type of calibration antenna used. For low gain nearly omni-directional
antennas like dipoles, it is normally sufficient to ensure that this
spacing is larger than 0.5 wavelengths. More directive calibration
antennas should be situated towards the centre of the chamber. The
calibration antenna should be present in the chamber during the
throughput measurements.

iii\. Calibrate the network analyzer with a full 2-port calibration in
such a way that the vector S-parameters between the ports of the fixed
measurement antenna and the calibration antenna can be accurately
measured. Preferably, the network analyzer is set to perform a frequency
sweep at each stirrer position. This will enable calibration of several
frequency points during the same stirring sequence, thereby reducing
calibration time. This will also enable frequency stirring, i.e.,
averaging the measured power transfer function over a small frequency
bandwidth around each measured frequency point (moving frequency
window). This will increase accuracy at the expense of frequency
resolution.

iv\. Connect the antennas and measure the S-parameters for each stirrer
position and each fixed measurement antenna.

The number of stirrer positions in the chosen stirring sequence, i.e.
the number of S-parameter samples at each frequency point, should be
chosen in such a way that it is large enough to yield an acceptable
statistical contribution to the total measurement uncertainty.

F.3.2 Calculation of the chamber reference transfer function
------------------------------------------------------------

From the S-parameters obtained in the calibration measurement, the
chamber reference transfer function for fixed antenna n can be
calculated. The reflection coefficient for fixed antenna n can be
calculated as

Thus, the chamber reference transfer function can be calculated as

where M is the total number of samples of the transfer function measured
for each fixed measurement antenna and is sample number m of the
transfer function for measurement antenna n. Moreover, is the complex
average of the calibration antenna reflection coefficient. Finally, is
the radiation efficiency of the calibration antenna.

Note that the radiation efficiency of the fixed antenna is not corrected
for, because it will be the same both during calibration and
measurements. Therefore the fixed antenna\'s radiation efficiency will
not affect the final results. The same can be said about the mismatch
factor of the fixed measurement antennas, but it is still advantageous
to correct for this factor if frequency stirring is applied to improve
accuracy.

F.3.3 Cable calibration
-----------------------

This measurement step will calibrate the power loss of the cables needed
to connect the instrument to the reverberation chamber.

i\. Disconnect the cables between the VNA and the chamber.

ii\. Connect the cables one-by-one between the two ports of the network
analyzer. The VNA must be calibrated at its own two ports.

iii\. Measure the frequency response of the transmission S-parameter (
or ) of the cable.

iv\. Save the power transfer values () of the frequency response curve
for the test frequencies. and cables positions, etc).

F.4 Calibration Procedure: RTS method
=====================================

For the RTS method, only the DUT reporting RSAP calibration is to
perform. The RTS method depends on reported RSAP to do the antenna
pattern measurement, and the power calibration for radiated second-stage
throughput test. Since these reported readings do not come from a
calibrated measurement instrument, their accuracies are often subject to
questioning. Below procedure provides method for proper calibration to
validate the reported RSAP accuracy.

● DUT reporting RSAP calibration calibration:

With proper spherical coordinate definition of mobile terminal setup,
the receive antenna pattern at any coordinate (θi, ϕi) can be expressed
as:

P(θi, ϕi)= RSi (1)

The test point (θi, ϕi) can be at any point on the 4π solid angle of the
coordinate. More precisely, the reported RS of the UE can be expressed
as:

RSi (x)= m(x)\*x+c (2)

where m(x~i~) and c is a function of signal strength independent of
testing point angular coordinates. x is the actual incident field power
density that can be derived from the signal power and test range loss.
The above equation (2) assumes that the signal variables in both sides
of the equation are expressed in decibels or dB\'s. When m(x)=1 and
c=g~0~, where g~0~ is the received antenna gain at the test point, we
would have declared that the RS report is a true reading of the signal
strength. But in reality, m(x) can be biased by either the signal level
relative to the receiver\'s detector operating condition, or by
application software programming errors. Meanwhile, the offset constant
c can also be biased by either the noise floor of the receiver and/or
other artificial factors in the UE RS reporting. Therefore, a Taylor\'s
series can be introduced to have a better representation of the RS
report value:

RSi (x)= c +ax+ bx^2^ +dx^3^ + ex^4^ + \.... (3)

In theory, equation (3) may require many terms to represent the RS
report accurately. However, since the reported RS reading in the receive
antenna pattern in (1) has a limited signal dynamic range, the following
three term expression is enough to correct for the reporting errors:

RSi (x)= c +ax+ bx^2^ +o(x^3^) (4)

The third order term o(x^3^) is ignored since it is not significant for
limited signal dynamic range.

The RS pattern in (1) will need to be calibrated for its possible
reporting errors. One practical method is to introduce signal correction
terms in equation (4) to enhance the accuracy. This process is also
referred to as the linearization. The following steps describe what is
needed to linearize the RS report and the RS antenna pattern in (1):

1). Find the maximum RS reading in the pattern obtained in (1) from all
angular test points, and at all polarizations. Set this point as the
reference point and record signal generator power P~0~ and let x~0~
=P~0~-Test Range Path Loss (in dB), and note the maximum RS reading as
r~0~.

2). At the reference test point, decrease the signal generator\'s output
power P~i~, and let x~i~ = P~i~-Test Range Path Loss (in dB), starting
from P~0~ with a step size (1.0 dB by default) to a power range so as to
obtain the full RS reading range while searching from the reference
point r~0~ when the test system dynamic range allows, or to 20 dB by
default when the system dynamic range is known to be limited, whichever
is lower in range. Record the corresponding RS reading of the UE as
r~i~. Repeat this process until all angular test points are completed as
required.

3). Use those pairs of data obtained in Step 2) (r~i~, x~i~) as the
input of the quadratic fitting curve in (4) to formulate the Algorithm
LSF (Least Square Fit) to calculate the three coefficients (a,b, and c)
in:

Err(a,b,c)= Σ(c + ax~i~ + bx~i~ - r~i~)^2^ (5)

Please note that the power range of the linearization can be limited to
20 dB as stated in Step 2) since the lower RS readings than the
processed range do not contribute to the overall receive antenna pattern
as much.

Once the three coefficients (a,b, and c) are obtained in LSF of (5), the
use of the inverse function of Equation (4) to convert RS pattern in (1)
into the normalized incident power pattern. This process completes the
error correction for both constant biased and the non-linearity in the
RS report from the UE within the limited signal dynamic range as tested
in (1) and Step 1. Similar steps can be applied for error corrections if
multiple receiver RS are involved in the testing.

Of course, the reference test point can also be further tested for the
threshold of the receiver sensitivity and/or throughput knee-point for
the required calibrated reference power level.

F.5 Noise Floor Measurement Procedure -- Anechoic chamber method with multiprobe configuration
==============================================================================================

The noise floor of system at the DUT location must be sufficiently lower
than the signal levels used to measure the device. The following
procedure determines the noise level at the DUT location.

Prior to measuring the system, the noise floor of the spectrum analyser
is measured. The noise floor of the spectrum analyser must be at or
lower than the noise floor limit of TBD.

**Measure the Noise Floor of the Spectrum Analyzer:**

1\. Connect a 50 ohm load to the input of the Spectrum Analyzer

2\. Turn on the Spectrum Analyzer and allow it to come to a stable
operating temperature

3\. Set the spectrum analyzer as follows:

\- Averaging set to 20

\- Set Detector (Averaging) to RMS

\- Span 13.5 MHz

\- Resolution BW 30 kHz

\- Video BW 50 MHz

\- (Optional) Pre-amplifier on

\- Internal attenuator set to 0 dB

4\. Set the reference level according to the signal level that you are
measuring.

5\. Measure the average power over the channel bandwidth.

**Measuring the MPAC system Noise Floor**

The system shall be set up in the standard MPAC configuration. For each
frequency to be evaluated perform the following steps.

1\. Power on all the equipment and allow it to come to a stable
operating temperature

2\. Load the channel model as defined in 3GPP TR 37.977 in the channel
emulator.

3\. Using the channel emulator set the power level at the DUT location
to -90 dBm/ 15 kHz.

4\. Turn off the signal input to the channel emulator.

5\. Set the spectrum analyzer as follows:

\- Averaging set to 20

\- Set Detector (Averaging) to RMS

\- Span 13.5 MHz

\- Resolution BW 30 kHz

\- Video BW 50 MHz

\- (Optional) Pre-amplifier on

\- Internal attenuator set to 0 dB

6\. Connect the output of the first RF Amplifier which corresponds to
the first channel output of the channel emulator to the spectrum
analyser using a cable with a known loss.

7\. Set the reference level according to the signal level that you are
measuring.

8\. Measure the average power over the channel bandwidth.

9\. Add the losses from the output of the Amplifier to the DUT location
to the measurement performed in step 8.

10\. Repeat steps 6 through 9 until all 16 channels have been measured.

11\. Sum the noise (at DUT location calculated in step 9) from all 16
paths (in linear and convert to dBm) and account for any necessary
additional cable losses (from amplifier output to Spectrum Analyzer
input).

The result found in step 11 should be at or below the noise floor limit
of TBD.

#########  Annex G: Test Volume Validation

This annex describes the procedures for validating the test volume for
the different methodologies.

G.1 Test Volume Validation for the RC+CE Methodology
====================================================

The crucial parameters for defining the RC+CE test volume are the
isotropy and the standard deviation of the power transfer function. The
validation procedure will thus consist of the following:

\- Isotropy measurements in the extreme positions (boundaries) of the
test volume, as well as in positions within the boundaries of the test
volume.

\- Standard deviation of the power transfer function measured in the
same positions as defined for the isotropy measurements.

This is described in detail below.

G.1.1 Test Volume Validation Setup
----------------------------------

There are two main RC configurations available in the industry. The
first configuration utilizes a turntable for the stirring sequence and
thus to emulate the desired environment. Additional stirring procedures
might also exist to further improve the accuracy of the emulated channel
properties. The DUT is kept on the turntable throughout the measurement
sequence, thus moved around in the test volume.

The second configuration does not utilize a turntable, thus instead
relying on other stirring procedures for emulating the desired
environment. For this case the DUT is kept at a fixed position in the
test volume throughout the measurement sequence.

In order to define a generic test volume validation procedure, it is
needed to differentiate between these two types of RCs.

### G.1.1.1 Type 1 Reverberation Chamber -- With Turntable

For RCs utilizing a stirring configuration with a turntable, the test
volume will consist of a cylinder as depicted in Figure G.1.1.1-1. The
Test Volume Validation Positions (TVVPs) in this test volume consist of
extreme positions, e.g. minimum distances to other metallic and/or
absorbing objects and the location on the turntable, as well as
additional positions representative to DUT test positions. Based on
Figure G.1.1.1-1, the following baseline TVVPs are identified:

\- TVVP1-3: These three positions correspond to the lower extremes of
having the DUT as close as possible to the metallic turntable plate and
still fulfil the 0.5 lambda guideline from \[22\].

o TVVP1 will experience a minimum of statistics, given that a DUT in
this position will be kept at the same position throughout the
measurement. This position could also be shifted away from the centre of
the turntable, if needed for the accuracy of the measurements. For such
case, the test volume would be a cylinder with the centre excluded.

o TVVP2 corresponds to additional test position representative to DUT
test position for gathering sufficient statistics.

o TVVP3 is the edge of the test volume. This is the position farthest
away from the turntable centre that still fulfils the requirement in
\[22\] of being 0.5 lambda separated from other metallic or absorbing
objects in the chamber (e

\- TVVP4-6: These three positions correspond to additional test
positions in the centre azimuth cut of the cylinder representative to
DUT test positions, in order to gather sufficient statistics for the
validation. The individual points correspond to the same distances from
the centre of the turntable as TVVP1-3.

\- TVVP7-9: These three positions correspond to extreme points at the
upper edge of the test volume, which still satisfy the requirements in
\[22\] of being 0.5 lambda away from metallic or absorbing objects (in
this case the metallic stirrer plate; it can also be bounded by the roof
of the chamber). The individual points correspond to the same distances
from the centre of the turntable as TVVP1-3.

One azimuth cut consisting of 3 TVVPs is shown in Figure G.1.1.1-2 for
clarity.

In addition to metallic surfaces and objects, different amount of
absorbing objects can be used for obtaining the desired chamber
characteristics. If such objects exist the boundaries of the test volume
must be set as to take these into account. This case is depicted in
Figure G.1.1.1-3, where the absorber located on the chamber wall
decreases the size of the test volume.

The 9 positions defined above will be the TVVPs for Type 1 RCs and will
define the valid test volume. The test system vendor should declare
these 9 TVVPs for each implementation.

Having nine individual measurements will provide a sufficient
statistical ground for concluding on the RC test volume characteristics.
It matches the minimum number of points adopted for characterizing the
uncertainty related to the chamber statistical ripple and repeatability
in TS34.114 \[4\]. Observe however that there will be three orientations
measured for each position, in order to calculate the anisotropy
coefficients. This means that there will be 27 individual estimates of
the power transfer function and all of these shall be used for the
standard deviation calculation.

In order to pass the test volume validation, the isotropy in all TVVPs
must satisfy the requirements and standard deviation of the power
transfer function must result in an acceptable overall uncertainty once
combined with the other uncertainty sources. If any of the positions
fail the isotropy test or the resulting uncertainty exceeds acceptable
limits, the test volume boundaries, and thus the TVVPs, must be
redefined and the procedure repeated in the new TVVPs.

### G.1.1.2 Type 2 Reverberation Chamber -- Without Turntable

For RCs utilizing a stirring configuration without a turntable, the test
volume will consist of a rectangular box as depicted in Figure
G.1.1.2-1. As for Type 1 chambers, the TVVPs correspond to extreme
positions, e.g. minimum distances to other metallic and/or absorbing
objects and the location on the turntable, as well as additional
positions representative to DUT test positions. Based on Figure
G.1.1.2-1, the following baseline TVVPs are identified:

\- TVVP1-4: These four corner positions correspond to the lower extremes
of having the DUT as close as possible to the metallic floor as well as
two additional walls of the chamber (or stirrers and other metallic
objects) and still fulfil the 0.5 lambda guideline from \[22\].

\- TVVP5-8: These four corner positions correspond to the upper extremes
of having the DUT as close as possible to the metallic roof as well as
two additional walls of the chamber (or stirrers and other metallic
objects) and still fulfil the 0.5 lambda guideline from \[22\]. The
individual points correspond to the same distances from the chamber
walls as TVVP1-4.

\- TVVP9: This is the centre position of the test volume and represents
an additional point representative to DUT test position and provides
additional statistics.

In addition to metallic surfaces and objects, different amount of
absorbing objects can be used for obtaining the desired chamber
characteristics. If such objects exist the boundaries of the test volume
must be set as to take these into account, as for Type 1 RCs.

The 9 positions defined above will be the TVVPs for Type 2 RCs and will
define the valid test volume. The test system vendor should declare
these 9 TVVPs for each implementation.

Having nine individual measurements will provide a sufficient
statistical ground for concluding on the RC test volume characteristics.
It matches the minimum number of points adopted for characterizing the
uncertainty related to the chamber statistical ripple and repeatability
in TS34.114 \[4\]. Observe however that there will be three orientations
measured for each position, in order to calculate the anisotropy
coefficients. This means that there will be 27 individual estimates of
the power transfer function and all of these shall be used for the
standard deviation calculation.

***In order to pass the test volume validation, the isotropy in all
TVVPs must satisfy the requirements and standard deviation of the power
transfer function must result in an acceptable overall uncertainty once
combined with the other uncertainty sources. If any of the positions
fail the isotropy test or the resulting uncertainty exceeds acceptable
limits, the test volume boundaries, and thus the TVVPs, must be

G.1.2 Test Volume Validation Procedure
--------------------------------------

In each of the positions defined above, the procedure described in
Clause C.3.2.5 of TR37.977 shall be used to obtain the test volume
validation data. From this data it is possible to calculate the metrics
of interest, as described below.

### G.1.2.1 Isotropy

The procedure described in Annex C.3.2.5 shall be used to evaluate the
isotropy in each TVVP.

### G.1.2.2 Chamber Statistical Ripple and Repeatability

From the data obtained with the procedure above the chamber transfer
function is calculated for each TVVP. The normalized standard deviation
is then calculated as

where

M is the number of antenna positions used for the estimate, in this case
27 (9 TVVPs and 3 orientations in each TVVP).

The total standard deviation is then given by

where is 1.05.

The standard measurement uncertainty estimate is obtained by selecting
the worst case for each band/channel combination. The value obtained
should be inserted into the uncertainty budget in Annex B.5 as the
"chamber statistical ripple and repeatability".
