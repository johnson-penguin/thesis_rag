This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:

**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something

**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something

The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the
context of normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.

The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes
for \"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as
possible, and they are not used in a normative context except in a
direct citation from an external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so
as to maintain continuity of style when extending or modifying the
provisions of such a referenced document.

**should** indicates a recommendation to do something

**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something

**may** indicates permission to do something

**need not** indicates permission not to do something

The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\"
are used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.

**can** indicates that something is possible

**cannot** indicates that something is impossible

The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\"
and \"need not\".

**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a
result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to
happen as a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which
is outside the scope of the present document

**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result
of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document

**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

In addition:

**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement
of fact

**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates
a statement of fact

The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

4 Description
=============

4.0 Overview
------------

This API is an extension to the ETSI TS 102 241 \[2\] \"UICC API for
Java Card™\" and requires the implementation of this specification.

The classes and interfaces described in this specification inherit
functionality from the classes and interfaces specified in the \"UICC
API for Java Card™\".

The (U)SAT Framework described in this specification is an extension of
the CAT Runtime Environment defined in ETSI TS 102 241 \[2\].

4.1 (U)SIM Java Card™ Architecture
----------------------------------

The overall architecture of the (U)SIM API is based on the \"UICC API
for Java Card™\" defined in ETSI TS 102 241 \[2\].

Figure 1: (U)SIM Java Card™ Architecture

5 File Access API
=================

The (U)SIM file access API consists of the package *uicc.usim.access*.
This package defines additional constants to those defined in the
*uicc.access* package from ETSI TS 102 241 \[2\]. The access to the file
system, defined in TS 51.011 \[4\] and TS 31.102 \[3\], is the one
specified in ETSI TS 102 241 \[2\] via the UICC *FileView* Interface.

==================

6.0 Overview
------------

The (U)SIM toolkit API consists of the *uicc.usim.toolkit* package for
toolkit features defined in TS 31.111 \[7\] and TS 51.014 \[8\], and is
based on the *uicc.toolkit* package defined in ETSI TS 102 241 \[2\]*.*

6.1 Applet triggering
---------------------

See ETSI TS 102 241 \[2\].

### 6.1.1 Exception Handling

The following clause describes the handling of exceptions by the (U)SAT
Framework in addition to the behaviour defined in ETSI TS 102 241 \[2\]
for the CAT Runtime Environment.

If an Applet triggered by EVENT\_FORMATTED\_SMS\_PP\_ENV event throws an
ISOException with the reason code (0x6FXX), it shall be sent to the
terminal.

Other Exceptions shall not be propagated to the terminal.

6.2 Definition of Events
------------------------

The following events can trigger a Toolkit Applet in addition to the
events defined in ETSI TS 102 241 \[2\], all short values are reserved
in ETSI TS 102 241 \[2\]:

*EVENT\_FORMATTED\_SMS\_PP\_ENV, EVENT\_UNFORMATTED\_SMS\_PP\_ENV,\
EVENT\_FORMATTED\_SMS\_PP\_UPD, EVENT\_UNFORMATTED\_SMS\_PP\_UPD*

There are two ways for a card to receive a Short Message Point to Point:
via an ENVELOPE(SMS-PP Download) APDU as defined in TS 31.111 \[7\] and
TS 51.014 \[8\] or an UPDATE RECORD EF~SMS~ APDU as defined in
TS 31.102 \[3\] and TS 51.011 \[4\]. The EF~SMS~ can be either located
under the DF~Telecom~ or under any ADF as defined in TS 31.102 \[3\] and
TS 51.011 \[4\].

The received Short Message may be:

\- formatted according to TS 31.115 \[9\] or an other protocol to
identify explicitly the toolkit applet for which the message is sent;

\- unformatted (e.g. a toolkit applet specific protocol ) then the
(U)SAT Framework will pass this data to all registered toolkit applets.

When the Short Message is received as Concatenated Short Messages as
defined in TS 23.040 \[10\], it is the responsibility of the (U)SAT
Framework to link single Short Messages together to re -- assemble the
original message before any further processing. The original Short
Message shall be placed in one SMS TPDU TLV (with TP-UDL field coded on
one octet) included in the *USATEnvelopeHandler*. The concatenation
control headers used to re-assemble the short messages in the correct
order shall not be present in the SMS TPDU. The TP-elements of the SMS
TPDU and the Address (TS -- Service-Centre-Address) shall correspond to
the ones in the last received Short Message (independently of the
Sequence number of Information-Element-Data).

The minimum requirement for the (U)SAT Framework is to process a
concatenated short message with the following properties:

\- the Information Element Identifier is equal to the 8-bit reference
number.

\- it contains uncompressed 8 bit data or uncompressed UCS2 data.

EVENT\_FORMATTED\_SMS\_PP\_ENV

Upon reception of a TS 31.115 \[9\] formatted Short Message Point to
Point (Single or Concatenated) via an ENVELOPE, the (U)SAT Framework
shall:

\- verify the security of the Short Message as per TS 31.115 \[9\];

\- trigger the toolkit applet registered with the corresponding TAR;

\- take the optional Application Data posted by the triggered toolkit
applet if present;

\- secure and send the response packet using SMS-DELIVER-REPORT or
SMS-SUBMIT.

When the toolkit applet is triggered, data shall be provided deciphered.

EVENT\_UNFORMATTED\_SMS\_PP\_ENV

Upon reception of an unformatted Short Message Point to Point (Single or
Concatenated) via an ENVELOPE, the (U)SAT Framework shall trigger all
the Toolkit Applets registered to this event.

NOTE: As a consequence of the *EnvelopeResponseHandler* availability
rules specified in clause 6.6, only the first triggered toolkit applet
is guaranteed to be able to send back a response.

EVENT\_FORMATTED\_SMS\_PP\_UPD

Upon reception of a TS 31.115 \[9\] formatted Short Message Point to
Point (Single or Concatenated) via an UPDATE RECORD EF~SMS~, the (U)SAT
Framework shall:

\- update the EF~SMS~ file with the data received, it is then up to the
receiving toolkit applet to change the SMS stored in the file (i.e. the
toolkit applet need to have access to the EF~SMS~ file)

\- verify the security of the Short Message as per TS 31.115 \[9\];

\- convert the UPDATE RECORD EF~SMS~ APDU into a COMPREHENSION TLV List;

\- trigger the toolkit applet registered with the corresponding TAR;

When the toolkit applet is triggered, data shall be provided deciphered.

The *USATEnvelopeHandler* provided to the applet shall:

\- return *BTAG\_SMS\_PP\_DOWNLOAD* to the *getTag()* method call**;**

\- return the Comprehension TLV list length to the *getLength()* method
call;

The *USATEnvelopeHandler* provided to the applet shall contain the
following COMPREHENSION TLVs:

\- Device Identities TLV

The Device Identities Comprehension TLV is used to store the information
about the absolute record number in the EF~SMS~ file and the value of
the EF~SMS~ record status byte, and is formatted as defined below:

  -------------------------------------
  Device identities Comprehension TLV
  Device Identities tag
  length = 02
  Absolute Record Number
  Record Status
  -------------------------------------

With the absolute record number the toolkit applet can update EF~SMS~ in
absolute mode to change the received SMS (e.g. in a readable text).

For Concatenated Short Message the Absolute Record Number and the Record
Status will correspond to the last UPDATE RECORD EF~SMS~ APDU received.

\- Address TLV

The value is the TS-Service-Centre-Address (RP-OA) of the last UPDATE
RECORD EF~SMS~ APDU.

\- SMS TPDU TLV

The value is the SMS TPDU provided deciphered and reassembled, if needed

\- AID TLV

The AID comprehension TLV is present only if the EF~SMS~ file updated is
under an ADF. The value is the AID of the ADF as defined
TS 31.111 \[7\].

The order of the TLVs given in the *USATEnvelopeHandler* is not
specified,

NOTE: To get each COMPREHENSION TLV, it is recommended that the applet
uses the *ViewHandler.findTLV()* methods

> *EVENT\_UNFORMATTED\_SMS\_PP\_UPD*

Upon reception of an unformatted Short Message Point to Point (Single or
Concatenated) via UPDATE RECORD EF~SMS~ APDU, the (U)SAT Framework shall
:

\- update the EF~SMS~ file with the data received;

\- convert the UPDATE RECORD EF~SMS~ APDU data into a COMPREHENSION TLV
List (as described for *EVENT\_FORMATTED\_SMS\_PP\_UPD*);

\- trigger all the Toolkit Applets registered to this event.

The content of EF~SMS~ may have been modified by a previously triggered
Toolkit Applet..

*EVENT\_FORMATTED\_SMS\_CB, EVENT\_UNFORMATTED\_SMS\_CB*

The received Cell Broadcast Message, via an ENVELOPE (CELL BROADCAST
DOWNLOAD) APDU as defined in TS 31.111 \[7\] and TS 51.014 \[8\] and,
can be either:

\- formatted according to TS 31.115 \[9\] or an other protocol to
identify explicitly the toolkit applet for which the message is sent;

\- unformatted ( e.g. using a toolkit applet specific protocol ), then
the (U)SAT Framework will pass this data to all registered toolkit
applets.

When the Cell Broadcast Message is received as multiple pages as defined
in TS 23.041 \[5\], it is the responsibility of the (U)SAT Framework to
link single pages together to re‑assemble the original message before
any further processing. The original Cell Broadcast message shall be
placed in one Cell Broadcast page TLV included in the
*USATEnvelopeHandler*. The message parameters shall correspond to the
ones in the last received Cell Broadcast page (independently of the Page
Parameter).

EVENT\_FORMATTED\_SMS\_CB

Upon reception of a TS 31.115 \[9\] formatted Cell Broadcast message,
the (U)SAT Framework shall:

\- verify the security of the Cell Broadcast message as per
TS 31.115 \[9\];

\- trigger the toolkit applet registered with the corresponding TAR;

When the toolkit applet is triggered, data shall be provided deciphered.

EVENT\_UNFORMATTED\_SMS\_CB

Upon reception of an unformatted Cell Broadcast message, the (U)SAT
Framework shall trigger all the Toolkit Applets registered to this
event.

*EVENT\_MO\_SHORT\_MESSAGE\_CONTROL\_BY\_NAA*

Upon reception of an ENVELOPE (MO SHORT MESSAGE CONTROL defined in
TS 51.014 \[8\] and TS 31.111 \[7\]) APDU as defined in TS 31.101 \[6\]
and TS 51.011 \[4\] the (U)SAT Framework shall trigger the Toolkit
Applet registered to this event. The (U)SAT Framework shall not allow
more than one Toolkit Applet to be registered to this event at a
time(e.g. if a Toolkit Applet is registered to this event but not in
selectable state the (U)SAT Framework shall not allow another Toolkit
Applet to register to this event).

*EVENT\_FORMATTED\_USSD, EVENT\_UNFORMATTED\_USSD*

The received USSD String, via an ENVELOPE (USSD Data Download) APDU as
defined in TS 31.111 \[7\], may be:

\- formatted according to TS 31.115 \[9\] or an other protocol to
identify explicitly the toolkit applet for which the message is sent;

\- unformatted (e.g. a toolkit applet specific protocol) then the (U)SAT
Framework will pass this data to all registered toolkit applets.

When the USSD Message is received as concatenated as defined in
TS 31.115 \[9\], it is the responsibility of the (U)SAT Framework to
link single USSD Messages together to re‑assemble the original message
before any further processing. The original USSD message shall be placed
in one USSD String TLV included in the *USATEnvelopeHandler*. The USSD
String parameters (DCS, PFI, CCF) shall correspond to the ones in the
last received USSD String (independently of the CCF Sequence number).

EVENT\_FORMATTED\_USSD

Upon reception of a TS 31.115 \[9\] formatted USSD Message via an
ENVELOPE, the (U)SAT Framework shall:

6.3 Registration
----------------

A Toolkit Applet shall register to events described in 6.2 as defined in
ETSI TS 102 241 \[2\].

Constants for these events are available in
*uicc.usim.toolkit.ToolkitConstants* interface in Annex A.

The *uicc.toolkit.ToolkitException* TAR\_NOT\_DEFINED shall be thrown if
a Toolkit Applet has no TAR defined and registers to events:
EVENT\_FORMATTED\_SMS\_PP\_ENV, EVENT\_FORMATTED\_SMS\_PP\_UPD,
*EVENT\_FORMATTED\_SMS\_CB, EVENT\_FORMATTED\_USSD*.

The *uicc.toolkit.ToolkitException*.EVENT\_ALREADY\_REGISTERED shall be
thrown if there is another Toolkit Applet already registered to
*EVENT\_MO\_SHORT\_MESSAGE\_CONTROL\_BY\_NAA.*

6.4 Proactive command handling
------------------------------

There is no extension of the CAT Runtime Environment by the (U)SAT
Framework for proactive command handling.

6.5 Envelope response handling
------------------------------

For the events defined in the present document, the following rules
apply:

A Toolkit Applet can post a response by using the *post()* method or the
*postAsBERTLV()* method defined in ETSI TS 102 241 \[2\]. The (U)SAT
Framework shall return the Status Word as defined in TS 31.111 \[7\] and
in TS 51.014 \[8\] depending on the current NAA.

Case of EVENT\_MO\_SHORT\_MESSAGE\_CONTROL\_BY\_NAA:

\- The rules defined for *EVENT\_CALL\_CONTROL\_BY\_NAA* in
ETSI TS 102 241 \[2\] apply.

Case of EVENT\_UNFORMATTED\_SMS\_PP\_ENV:

*- See* ETSI TS 102 241 \[2\].

Case of EVENT\_FORMATTED\_SMS\_PP\_ENV:

\- When the *post()* or the *postAsBERTLV()* method is invoked, the
(U)SAT Framework shall, according to bit 6 of the second octet of the
SPI defined in TS 31.115 \[9\], build a SMS-DELIVER-REPORT or a
SMS-SUBMIT.

In case of a SMS-DELIVER-REPORT and if the post response is too large to
be contained in a SMS-DELIVER-REPORT, the (U)SAT Framework shall issue
Response Packets as defined in TS 31.115 \[9\].

In case of a SMS-DELIVER-REPORT, the (U)SAT Framework shall return the
Status Word for RP-ACK or RP-ERROR as defined in TS 31.111 \[7\] and in
TS 51.014 \[8\] depending on the current NAA.

In case of SMS-SUBMIT the boolean value method parameter shall be
ignored by the (U)SAT Framework. If the SMS-SUBMIT is to be used, the
(U)SAT Framework shall build and issue a Send Short Message proactive
command as defined in TS 31.111 \[7\] and in TS 51.014 \[8\] depending
on the current NAA .

Case of EVENT\_FORMATTED\_USSD:

\- When the *post()* or the *postAsBERTLV()* method is invoked, the
(U)SAT Framework shall build a USSD String to be sent back in the Return
Result Component contained in the subsequent Facility message. In that
case the (U)SAT Framework shall return the Status Word as defined in
TS 31.111 \[7\].

Case of EVENT\_UNFORMATTED\_USSD:

*- See* ETSI TS 102 241 \[2\].

6.6 System Handler management
-----------------------------

For the handler management of the *ProactiveHandler*, the
*ProactiveResponseHandler*, the *EnvelopeHandler* and the
*EnvelopeResponseHandler*, the rules defined in ETSI TS 102 241 \[2\]
apply.

***USATEnvelopeHandler:***

***The single system instance of the USATEnvelopeHandler and the single
system instance of the EnvelopeHandler are two distinct objects
instances.***

\- When available the *USATEnvelopeHandler* shall remain available and
its content shall remain unchanged from the invocation to the
termination of the *processToolkit()* method.

\- The TLV List provided in the *USATEnvelopeHandler* are the same as in
the *EnvelopeHandler*.

\- The handler availability of the *USATEnvelopeHandler* is the same
handler availability as the *EnvelopeHandler* including all the events
defined in ETSI TS 102 241 \[2\].

The following table describes the minimum availability of the handlers
for all the events at the invocation of the *processToolkit()* method of
the Toolkit Applet. The rules described in this table apply in addition
to the rules described in \"UICC API for Java Card™\"

6.7 (U)SAT Framework behaviour
------------------------------

The (U)SAT Framework is a (U)SAT extension of the CAT Runtime
Environment as defined in ETSI TS 102 241 \[2\]. In addition, the (U)SAT
Framework shall consider the EVENT\_EVENT\_DOWNLOAD\_\* defined in this
specification when issuing the SET UP EVENT LIST system proactive
command.

7 UICC toolkit applet
=====================

See ETSI TS 102 241 \[2\].

8 Geo Location API
==================

The Geo Location API consists of the package *uicc.usim.geolocation*.
This package defines services to allow an Applet to perform a
geographical location operation, depending of the ME capabilities. When
a geographical location operation is requested, the API will follow a
defined way to choose either \"Geographical Location Request\" toolkit
command or \"Provide Local Information\" toolkit command as defined in
TS 31.111 \[7\] to determine the location information. The result is
formatted using GAD shapes as defined in TS 23.032 \[14\] or in the
format of NMEA sentences defined in IEC 61162-1 \[15\].

9 SUCI API
==========

The SUCI API consists of the package *uicc.usim.suci*. This package
defines services to allow an Applet to perform a SUCI computation upon
reception of terminal request.

If an applet has registered an object implementing the interface
*SUCICalculator* to the USIM application, then when the ME sends a
GET IDENTITY APDU Command in SUCI context to this USIM application, the
(U)SAT framework shall invoke the *getSUCI* method in order to retrieve
the SUCI to be returned to the ME. Only one object can be registered per
USIM application. The reference to the object is needed to dereference
the object. If no object is registered, the USIM shall return the SUCI
computed by its own means, according to the USIM configuration.

If an exception is raised, the (U)SAT framework behaviour is
implementation specific.

The package AID coding is defined in ETSI TS 101 220 \[1\]. The (U)SIM
API packages\' AID are not modified by changes to Major or Minor
Version.

The Major Version shall be incremented if a change to the specification
introduces byte code incompatibility with the previous version.

The Minor Version shall be incremented if a change to the specification
does not introduce byte code incompatibility with the previous version.

For a table describing the versioning of a package, a line is introduced
only upon changes of Major or Minor version of its package.

The package *uicc.usim.access* contains only constants, therefore it may
not be loaded on the UICC.
