Foreword
========

This Technical Specification (TS) has been produced by the 3^rd^
Generation Partnership Project (3GPP).

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

Y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

Introduction
============

The present document defines the interface tests for the Terminal / UICC
interface.

The aim of the present document is to ensure interoperability between an
UICC and a Terminal independently of the respective manufacturer, card
issuer or operator.

Application specific tests for applications residing on an UICC are
specified in document TS 31.121 \[2\].

1 Scope
=======

The present document specifies the interface test for the Terminal /
UICC.

The present document specifies the tests of:

> \- physical characteristics of the UICC;
>
> \- the electrical interface between the UICC and the Terminal;
>
> \- the initial communication establishment and the transport
> protocols;
>
> \- the application independent procedures.

2 References
============

The following documents contain provisions which, through reference in
this text, constitute provisions of the present document.

• References are either specific (identified by date of publication,
edition number, version number, etc.) or non‑specific.

• For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.

• For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the case
of a reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), a
non-specific reference implicitly refers to the latest version of that
document *in the same Release as the present document*.
