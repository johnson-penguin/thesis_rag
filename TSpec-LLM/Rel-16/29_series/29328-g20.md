 Foreword
========

This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:

**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something

**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something

The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the
context of normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.

The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes
for \"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as
possible, and they are not used in a normative context except in a
direct citation from an external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so
as to maintain continuity of style when extending or modifying the
provisions of such a referenced document.

**should** indicates a recommendation to do something

**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something

**may** indicates permission to do something

**need not** indicates permission not to do something

The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\"
are used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.

**can** indicates that something is possible

**cannot** indicates that something is impossible

The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\"
and \"need not\".

**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a
result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to
happen as a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which
is outside the scope of the present document

**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result
of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document

**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

In addition:

**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement
of fact

**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates
a statement of fact

The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

1 Scope
=======

This 3GPP Technical Specification (TS) specifies:

1\. The interactions between the HSS (Home Subscriber Server) and the
SIP AS (Application Server) and between the HSS and the OSA SCS (Service
Capability Server). This interface is referred to as the Sh reference
point.

2\. The interactions between the SIP AS and the SLF (Subscription
Locator Function) and between the OSA SCS and the SLF. This interface is
referred to as the Dh reference point.

The IP Multimedia (IM) Core Network Subsystem stage 2 is specified in
3GPP TS 23.228 \[1\] and the signalling flows for the IP multimedia call
control based on SIP and SDP are specified in 3GPP TS 24.228 \[2\].

The IP Multimedia (IM) Session Handling with the IP Multimedia (IM) call
model is specified in 3GPP TS 23.218 \[4\].

This document addresses the signalling flows and message contents for
the protocol at the Sh and Dh interface.

This document also addresses how the functionality of Ph interface is
accomplished.

The Presence Service Stage 2 description (architecture and functional
solution) is specified in 3GPP TS 23.141 \[18\].

3 Definitions, symbols and abbreviations
========================================

3.1 Definitions
---------------

For the purposes of the present document, the following terms and
definitions apply.

**IP Multimedia session:** IP Multimedia session and IP Multimedia call
are treated as equivalent in this specification.

**Transparent data**: Data that is understood syntactically but not
semantically by the HSS. It is data that an AS may store in the HSS to
support its service logic. One example is data that an AS stores in the
HSS, using it as a repository.

**Non-transparent data**: Data that is understood both syntactically and
semantically by the HSS.

**AS (Application Server)**: a term used to denote either of a SIP
Application Server or an OSA Service Capability Server.

4 Main Concept
==============

This document presents the Sh interface related functional requirements
of the communicating entities.

It gives a functional classification of the procedures and describes the
procedures and message parameters.

Error handling flows, protocol version identification, etc. procedures
are also included.

5 General Architecture
======================

This clause further specifies the architectural assumptions associated
with the Sh reference point, building on 3GPP TS 23.228 \[1\], 3GPP
TS 23.218 \[4\] and also the Ph reference point building upon 3GPP
TS 23.141 \[18\].

5.1 Functional requirements of network entities
-----------------------------------------------

### 5.1.1 Functional Requirements of the Application Server

The Application Server may communicate with the HSS over the Sh
interface.

For functionality of the Application Server refer to 3GPP TS 23.002
\[3\], 3GPP TS 23.228 \[1\] and 3GPP TS 23.218 \[4\].

### 5.1.2 Functional requirements of HSS

The HSS may communicate with the Application Server over the Sh
interface and with the Presence Network Agent over the Ph interface. The
functionality of the Ph interface shall be the same as the functionality
of the Sh interface.

For functionality of the HSS refer to 3GPP TS 23.002 \[3\], 3GPP TS
23.228 \[1\] and 3GPP TS 23.218 \[4\].

### 5.1.3 Functional Requirements of the Presence Network Agent

The Presence Network Agent may communicate with the HSS over the Ph
interface. In this case, all references to an Application Server in this
specification apply also to a Presence Network Agent.

5.2 Functional classification of Sh interface procedures
--------------------------------------------------------

Operations on the Sh interface are classified in functional groups:

1\. Data handling procedures

\- The download of data from the HSS to an AS.

\- The update of data in the HSS.

2\. Subscription/notification procedures

\- An AS can subscribe to receive notifications from the HSS of changes
in data.

\- The HSS can notify an AS of changes in data for which the AS
previously had subscribed.

6 Procedure Descriptions
========================

In the tables that describe the Information Elements transported by each
command, each Information Element is marked as (M) Mandatory, (C)
Conditional or (O) Optional.

\- A mandatory Information Element (marked as (M) in the table) shall
always be present in the command. If this Information Element is absent,
an application error occurs at the receiver and an answer message shall
be sent back to the originator of the request with the Result-Code set
to DIAMETER\_MISSING\_AVP. This message shall also include a Failed-AVP
AVP containing the missing Information Element i.e. the corresponding
Diameter AVP defined by the AVP Code and the other fields set as
expected for this Information Element.

\- A conditional Information Element (marked as (C) in the table) shall
be present in the command if certain conditions are fulfilled.

\- If the receiver detects that those conditions are fulfilled and the
Information Element is absent, an application error occurs and an answer
message shall be sent back to the originator of the request with the
Result-Code set to DIAMETER\_MISSING\_AVP. This message shall also
include a Failed-AVP AVP containing the missing Information Element i.e.
the corresponding Diameter AVP defined by the AVP Code and the other
fields set as expected for this Information Element.

\- If those conditions are not fulfilled, the Information Element shall
be absent. If however this Information Element appears in the message,
it shall not cause an application error and it may be ignored by the
receiver if this is not explicitly defined as an error case. Otherwise,
an application error occurs at the receiver and an answer message with
the Result-Code set to DIAMETER\_AVP\_NOT\_ALLOWED shall be sent back to
the originator of the request. A Failed-AVP AVP containing a copy of the
corresponding Diameter AVP shall be included in this message.

\- An optional Information Element (marked as (O) in the table) may be
present or absent in the command, at the discretion of the application
at the sending entity. Absence or presence of this Information Element
shall not cause an application error and may be ignored by the receiver.

When a procedure is required to determine the Public Identity used for
an identity lookup in HSS and SLF, the HSS and SLF shall derive the
Public Identity from the SIP URI or Tel URI contained in the
Public-Identity AVP, if not already in canonical form as per 3GPP TS
23.003 \[11\], as described below:

\- If the Public-Identity AVP contains a SIP URI, the HSS and SLF shall
follow rules for conversion of SIP URI into canonical form as specified
in IETF RFC 3261 \[16\] chapter 10.3.

\- If the Public-Identity AVP contains a Tel URI in E.164 format, the
HSS and SLF shall remove visual separators and remove all URI
parameters.

When a command contains a ServiceData XML element with or without
content (i.e. \<ServiceData\>\</ ServiceData\>), the Service Data
element is defined as present in the clauses 6.1 to 6.4.

Unknown permanent failure error codes shall be treated in the same way
as DIAMETER\_UNABLE\_TO\_COMPLY. For unknown transient failure error
codes the request may be repeated, or handled in the same way as
DIAMETER\_UNABLE\_TO\_COMPLY.

6.1 User data handling procedures
---------------------------------

### 6.1.1 Data read (Sh-Pull)

This procedure is used between the AS and the HSS. The procedure is
invoked by the AS and is used:

\- To read transparent and/or non-transparent data for a specified user
from the HSS.

This procedure is mapped to the commands User-Data-Request/Answer in the
Diameter application specified in 3GPP TS 29.329 \[5\]. Tables 6.1.1.1
and 6.1.1.2 detail the involved information elements.

#### 6.1.1.1 Detailed behaviour

The HSS may prioritise the received request message according to
priority level received within the Session-Priority AVP.

NOTE 1: Refer to Annex I for HSS procedures associated with the handling
of both the Session-Priority AVP and DRMP AVP received in the request
message.

The conditions for the inclusion of Requested-Domain and Requested-Node
as an additional key to the requested data are described in table 7.6.1.
If repository data is requested, Service-Indication shall be present in
the request. If initial filter criteria are requested, the Server-Name
AVP shall contain the SIP URL of the AS that initiates the request;
requests for initial filter criteria are limited to those initial filter
criteria which are relevant to the requesting AS. If DSAI information is
requested, the DSAI-Tag AVP shall be present.

Upon reception of the Sh-Pull request, the HSS shall, in the following
order:

1\. In the AS permission list (see clause 6.2) check that the requested
user data is allowed to be read (Sh-Pull) by this AS by checking the
combination of the identity of the AS sending the request (identified by
the Origin-Host AVP) and the supplied Data-Reference.

> If one or more Data References in the request are not allowed to be
> read, Experimental-Result shall be set to
> DIAMETER\_ERROR\_USER\_DATA\_CANNOT\_BE\_READ in the Sh-Pull Response.

2\. Check that the User Identity for whom data is asked exists in HSS.
If not, Experimental-Result shall be set to
DIAMETER\_ERROR\_USER\_UNKNOWN in the Sh-Pull Response.

2a. Check if the Private Identity (if received) corresponds to
IMPU/MSISDN/External Identifier received in User-Identity. If not,
Experimental-Result-Code shall be set to
DIAMETER\_ERROR\_IDENTITIES\_DONT\_MATCH.

3\. If the type of the User Identity (i.e. IMS Public User Identity or
Public Service Identity, MSISDN or External Identifier) does not apply
according to Table 7.6.1 as access key for the Data-Reference (if
Notif-Eff is in use: for all the Data-References) indicated in the
request, Experimental-Result shall be set to
DIAMETER\_ERROR\_OPERATION\_NOT\_ALLOWED in the Sh-Pull Response.

3a. If data-reference is IPAddressSecureBindingInformation (22) and the
User Identity is an IMS Public User Identity that is shared between
multiple Private User Identities, Experimental-Result shall be set to
DIAMETER\_ERROR\_OPERATION\_NOT\_ALLOWED in the Sh-Pull Response.

4\. Check whether or not the data that is requested to be downloaded by
the AS is currently being updated by another entity. If there is an
update of the data in progress, the HSS may delay the Sh-Pull-Resp
message until the update has been completed. The HSS shall ensure that
the data returned is not corrupted by this conflict. If HSS is not able
to delay the Sh-Pull-Resp message e.g. due to timeout the
Experimental-Result-Code shall be set to
DIAMETER\_USER\_DATA\_NOT\_AVAILABLE.

4a. If T-ADS Information is requested, the HSS/UDM shall take into
account information possibly received from MME ,SGSN, and/or AMF during
the registration, location update or notification procedure, in order to
decide whether MME, SGSN and/or AMF need to be contacted before a
response is sent to the AS.

\- The HSS/UDM shall provide the most recent IMS Voice over PS Sessions
support indication as indicated by the serving nodes. The HSS/UDM shall
provide the Access Type and RAT type, if available. The HSS/UDM may also
provide the last UE activity time, if available which should include a
specific timezone. See Annex E.

NOTE 2: The last UE activity time without a specific timezone can result
in IMS receiving unexpected time if timezone is not included, especially
for roaming to PLMN with different timezone.

\- If all serving nodes need to be contacted, and if at least one
serving node does not support T-ADS Data Retrieval or did not
successfully answer to the T-ADS request from the HSS, the HSS shall
indicate that IMS Voice over PS Sessions support is unknown, i.e., the
HSS shall not indicate support, or non-support, of IMS Voice over PS
Sessions unless all registered serving nodes have provided indication of
their support, non-support, or detached status.

\- If the HSS/UDM knows that one of the registered serving nodes is a
Gn/Gp-SGSN, the HSS/UDM shall not contact the MME for T-ADS Data
Retrieval, and shall provide the most recent IMS Voice over PS Sessions
support indication as indicated by the Gn/Gp-SGSN and/or the AMF. If the
Gn/Gp-SGSN needs to be contacted and it does not support T-ADS Data
Retrieval, the HSS shall indicate IMS Voice over PS Sessions support is
unknown.

NOTE 3: If the UE is registered with both MME and SGSN, and the HSS
knows that the SGSN is a Gn/Gp-SGSN, the HSS does not need to know if
the MME supports IMS Voice over PS Sessions or not. The HSS can
determine that the SGSN registered is a Gn/Gp-SGSN by different ways,
e.g. by configuration, or according to the information (e.g. EPS
Subscription Data Not Needed Indicator) received in
MAP\_UpdateGPRSLocation request.

NOTE 4: If the UE is registered with both MME and SGSN, and the HSS is
unable to know that the SGSN is a Gn/Gp-SGSN, the HSS will indicate IMS
Voice over PS Sessions support as unknown if the MME does not support
T-ADS Data Retrieval or did not successfully answer to the T-ADS request
from the HSS, even if the Gn/Gp-SGSN indicated IMS Voice over PS
Sessions is supported.

\- If the serving node answers successfully to the T-ADS data request,
but it does not include any of the T-ADS Information Elements (IMS Voice
over PS Sessions Supported, Access Type, RAT Type and Last UE Activity
Time), the HSS shall indicate IMS Voice over PS Sessions support is not
supported, unless the subscriber is attached in another node that
indicates support (if applicable).

\- If at least one serving node provided T-ADS data to the HSS, the HSS
may also provide the received last UE activity time which should include
a specific timezone, Access Type and RAT type. If all serving nodes
successfully answer to the T-ADS request from the HSS, the HSS shall
provide the most recent IMS Voice over PS Sessions support indication as
indicated by the serving nodes.

NOTE 5: The last UE activity time without a specific timezone can result
in IMS receiving unexpected time if timezone is not included, especially
for roaming to PLMN with different timezone.

4b. If CSRN is requested but roaming number retrieval from the MSC/VLR
fails, the HSS shall include an empty CSRN element in the xml document
returned to the AS. In addition, if MTRR is applicable (see 3GPP TS
23.018 \[10\]), the HSS shall set an MTRR-Indication in the xml
document. See 3GPP TS 23.292 \[33\].

5\. The HSS shall include the data pertinent to the requested Data
Reference in the User-Data AVP. The HSS shall set the Result-Code to
DIAMETER\_SUCCESS. This includes cases where the data is not available
to the HSS. The pertinent data included shall refer to the received
IMPU/MSISDN/External Identifier and Private Identity (if present).

NOTE 6: Data referred to a Private Identity (e.g. IMS Private User
Identity) implies that only the data (e.g. Location Information)
specific for that Private Identity is included, regardless of the type
of User Identity received (e.g. IMS Public User Identity shared by
multiple IMS Private User Identities).

If both the AS and the HSS have determined via mutual feature evaluation
to not support the Notif-Eff feature and in the case that requested data
is not available to the HSS, the HSS shall not include the User-Data AVP
in the Sh-Pull Response.

If both the AS and the HSS support the Notif-Eff feature, the HSS shall
include the data pertinent to all the requested Data References, Service
Indications and Identity Sets in the User-Data AVP. The following
applies:

\- If none of the requested data is available to the HSS, the HSS shall
not include the User-Data AVP in the Sh-Pull Response.

\- If some of the requested data is not available to the HSS, it shall
be indicated as follows:

\- Empty repository data shall be indicated with the RepositoryData
element that contains a Service Indication and a Sequence Number but
does not contain a ServiceData element (i.e. ServiceData is not
present).

\- Unavailable Public Identifiers shall be indicated with an empty
PublicIdentifiers element.

\- Unavailable location information shall be indicated by an empty
CSLocationInformation and/or an empty PSLocationInformation element
and/or an empty EPSLocationInformation element.

\- Unavailable CS-UserState shall be indicated by a missing CSUserState
element.

\- Unavailable PS-UserState shall be indicated by a missing PSUserState
element.

\- Unavailable EPS-UserState shall be indicated by a missing
EPSUserState element.

\- Unavailable elements of Sh IMS Data shall be indicated as follows:

\- An unavailable S-CSCF name shall be indicated with empty SCSCFName
element.

\- An unavailable IP Address Secure Binding Information shall be
indicated with empty IPv4address element or empty IPv6prefix element.

\- If all iFCs for the user that are relevant for the AS are unavailable
it shall be indicated with empty IFCs element.

\- Not available UE SRVCC capability shall be indicated with missing
UE-SRVCC-Capability element.

\- Not available UE 5G SRVCC capability shall be indicated with missing
UE-5G-SRVCC-Capability element.

\- Not available STN-SR shall be indicated with empty STN-SR element.

NOTE 7: If the HSS supports interworking with UDM, the HSS can also take
into account the availability of the STN-SR from the UDM as described in
3GPP TS 23.632 \[48\].

\- Not available CSRN shall be indicated with empty CSRN element.

\- Not available IMSI shall be indicated with empty IMSI element.

NOTE 8: If there is no available STN-SR in the HSS, it indicates that
the user is not SRVCC subscribed and if there is no available STN-SR
from the UDM, it indicates that the user is not 5G-SRVCC subscribed, as
described in 3GPP TS 23.008 \[27\] and 3GPP TS 23.632 \[48\].

If there is an error in any of the above steps, then the HSS shall stop
processing and shall return the error code specified in the respective
step (see 3GPP TS 29.329 \[5\] and 3GPP TS 29.229 \[7\] for an
explanation of the error codes).

If the HSS cannot fulfil the received request for reasons not stated in
the above steps, e.g. due to a database error or empty mandatory data
elements, it shall stop processing the request and set Result-Code to
DIAMETER\_UNABLE\_TO\_COMPLY.

Otherwise, the requested operation shall take place and the HSS shall
return the Result-Code AVP set to DIAMETER\_SUCCESS. Result-Code
DIAMETER\_SUCCESS is used also if the requested data does not exist in
the HSS i.e. when the HSS is indicating valid empty data elements.

### 6.1.2 Data Update (Sh-Update)

This procedure is used between the AS and the HSS. The procedure is
invoked by the AS and is used:

\- To allow the AS to update the transparent (repository) data stored at
the HSS for each IMS Public User Identity (for Public User Identities
matching a Wildcarded Public User Identity, the transparent data shall
be stored per Wildcarded Public User Identity, and not for each specific
Public User Identity matching that Wildcarded Public User Identity) or
Public Service Identity (for Public Service Identities matching a
Wildcarded PSI, the transparent data shall be stored per Wildcarded PSI,
and not for each specific Public Service Identity matching that
Wildcarded PSI).

\- To allow the AS to update the PSI Activation State of a distinct
Public Service Identity in the HSS.

\- To allow the AS to update the Dynamic Service Activation Info stored
at the HSS.

\- To allow the AS to update the Short Message Service Registration Info
stored at the HSS.

\- To allow the AS to update the STN-SR stored at the HSS and/or the
STN-SR stored at the UDM.

NOTE: In accordance with 3GPP TS 23.632 \[48\], if there is only an
STN-SR available in the UDM, the STN-SR in the UDM is updated. If there
is only an STN-SR available in the HSS, the STN-SR in the HSS is
updated. If there is an STN-SR available in the UDM and in the HSS, the
STN-SR in the UDM and the HSS are updated.

This procedure is mapped to the commands Profile-Update-Request/Answer
in the Diameter application specified in 3GPP TS 29.329 \[5\]. Tables
6.1.2.1 and 6.1.2.2 detail the involved information elements.

#### 6.1.2.1 Detailed behaviour

Within the Sh-Update Request, the keys to determine the updated data are
part of the information element Data (See 7.6). When data in the
repository is updated (i.e. added, modified or removed)
Service-Indication and Sequence-Number are also sent as part of the
information element Data.

Newly added transparent data shall be associated with a Sequence Number
of 0 in the Sh-Update Request. Sequence Number value 0 is reserved
exclusively for indication of newly added transparent data.\
Modified and removed transparent data shall be associated within the
Sh-Update Request with a Sequence Number of n+1 where n is the original
Sequence Number associated with the transparent data before modification
or removal. If n equals 65535, then the next modification or deletion of
that transparent data shall be associated with a Sequence Number of 1.

Upon reception of the Sh-Update request, the HSS shall, in the following
order:

1\. In the AS permission list (see clause 6.2) check that the data that
is requested to be updated (Sh-Update) by this AS, is allowed to be
updated by checking the combination of the identity of the AS sending
the request (identified by the Origin-Host AVP) and the supplied
Data-Reference.

> \- If the data is not allowed to be updated, Experimental-Result shall
> be set to DIAMETER\_ERROR\_USER\_DATA\_CANNOT\_BE\_MODIFIED in the
> Sh-Update Response.

2\. Check that the User Identity in the request exists in the HSS. If
not, Experimental-Result shall be set to DIAMETER\_ERROR\_USER\_UNKNOWN
in the Sh-Update Response.

2a. Check if the Private User Identity (if received) corresponds to the
IMPU/MSISDN/External Identifier received in User-Identity. If not,
Experimental-Result-Code shall be set to
DIAMETER\_ERROR\_IDENTITIES\_DONT\_MATCH.

3\. If the type of the User Identity (i.e. IMS Public User Identity or
Public Service Identity or MSISDN or External Identifier) does not apply
according to Table 7.6.1 as access key for the Data-Reference (if
Update-Eff-Enhance is in use: for all the Data-References) indicated in
the request, Experimental-Result shall be set to
DIAMETER\_ERROR\_OPERATION\_NOT\_ALLOWED in the Sh-Update Response.

4\. If Data-Reference is PSIActivation (18), then the HSS shall check
that the User Identity contains a distinct Public Service Identity. If
it does, then the HSS shall update the corresponding PSI Activation
State and return the Result-Code AVP set to DIAMETER\_SUCCESS. If it
does not, then the Experimental-Result shall be set to
DIAMETER\_ERROR\_OPERATION\_NOT\_ALLOWED in the Sh-Update Response.

The change of a Public Service Identity from ACTIVE to INACTIVE shall
trigger the network initiated deregistration of the Public Service
Identity in the HSS.

4a. If Data-Reference is DSAI (19), check whether or not, for the Public
Identity, there is an instance of DSAI matching the DSAI-Tag contained
in the Sh-Update command. If so, then the HSS shall update the DSAI
value and return the Result-Code AVP set to DIAMETER\_SUCCESS. If not,
Experimental-Result shall be set to
DIAMETER\_ERROR\_DSAI\_NOT\_AVAILABLE.

The changes of DSAI value shall trigger the procedures described in
clause 7.14 in order to determine which initial filter criteria should
be masked or unmasked. If these procedures change the set of unmasked
initial filter criteria, the HSS should behave as if the initial filter
criteria had been administratively changed, which implies e.g. sending
Sh-Notif or Cx-Update\_Subscr\_Data messages (see 3GPP TS 29.228 \[6\]).

4b. If Data-Reference is SMSRegistrationInfo (24), check whether or not,
for the IMS Public User Identity or MSISDN or External Identifier,
IP-SM-GW number element contained in the Sh-Update command is empty. If
it is empty, then the HSS shall delete the stored registered IP-SM-GW
number (if any) and the stored registered IP-SM-GW Diameter Identity (if
any), and return the Result-Code AVP set to DIAMETER\_SUCCESS. A
preconfigured IP-SM-GW number and preconfigured IP-SM-GW Diameter
Identity shall not be deleted.

If it is not empty, the HSS shall store/update the registered IP-SM-GW
number and, if S6c is supported, the IP-SM-GW Diameter Identity as
received within the Origin-Host and Origin-Realm AVPs, and return the
Result-Code AVP set to DIAMETER\_SUCCESS. A preconfigured IP-SM-GW
number and preconfigured IP-SM-GW Diameter Identity shall not be
overwritten.

The Service Centre Address in the HSS shall not be updated by this
operation.

NOTE 1: The address of the Short Message Service Centre as defined in
7.6.16 is only applicable to Sh-Pull operation.

4c. If the Data-Reference indicates that repository data is present, and
if the HSS and the AS supports the Update-Eff feature, check whether
there are multiple repository data instances. If so, then repeat the
steps 5 and 6 below for each instance of repository data ensuring that
no repository data is changed until the checks done in the steps 5 and 6
have been successful for all the repository data instances.

4d. If the Data-Reference is STN-SR (27) and if the STN-SR is different
from the one previously stored or provisioned in the HSS, the HSS shall
overwrite the STN-SR. If the Data-Reference is STN-SR (27), the HSS
supports interworking with the UDM (see in 3GPP TS 23.632 \[48\]), and
if the STN-SR is different from the one previously stored or provisioned
in the UDM, the UDM shall overwrite the STN-SR. If the Data-Reference is
STN-SR (27), and if there is no stored STN-SR in the HSS and there is no
stored STN-SR in the UDM, Experimental-Result shall be set to
DIAMETER\_ERROR\_OPERATION\_NOT\_ALLOWED in the Sh-Update Response.

NOTE 2: If there is no stored STN-SR in the HSS, it indicates that the
user is not SRVCC subscribed and if there is no stored STN-SR in the
UDM, it indicates that the user is not 5G-SRVCC subscribed, as described
in 3GPP TS 23.008 \[27\].

5\. Check whether or not the data that is requested to be updated by the
AS, as identified by the Service-Indication, is currently being updated
by another entity. If there is an update of the data in progress,
Experimental-Result shall be set to
DIAMETER\_PRIOR\_UPDATE\_IN\_PROGRESS in the Sh-Update Response.

6\. Check whether or not there is any repository data stored at the HSS
already for the specified Service-Indication and the associated IMS
Public User Identity (or group if the IMS Public User Identity is alias)
or Public Service Identity.

\- If repository data identified by the Service-Indication is stored at
the HSS for the specified IMS Public User Identity, IMS Public User
Identity group or Public Service Identity, check the following premises:

1\. Sequence\_Number\_in\_Sh\_Update is not equal to 0

2\. (Sequence\_Number\_in\_Sh\_Update - 1) is equal to
(Sequence\_Number\_In\_HSS modulo 65535)

\- If either of the above premises is false then Experimental-Result
shall be set to DIAMETER\_ERROR\_TRANSPARENT\_DATA\_OUT\_OF\_SYNC in the
Sh-Update Response.

\- If both of the above premises are true, then check whether or not
Service Data is received within the Sh-Update Req.

\- If Service Data element is present in the Sh-Update Req, check
whether or not the size of the data is greater than that which the HSS
is prepared to accept.

\- If there is more data than the HSS is prepared to accept then
Experimental-Result shall be set to DIAMETER\_ERROR\_TOO\_MUCH\_DATA and
the new data shall be discarded.

\- If the HSS is prepared to accept the data, then the repository data
stored at the HSS shall be updated with the repository data sent in the
Sh-Update Req and the Sequence Number associated with that repository
data shall be updated with that sent in the Sh-Update Req. This triggers
the sending of Sh-Notif messages to any other ASs that are subscribed to
Notifications for updates to the service data for that IMS Public User
Identity or Public Service Identity. This also triggers the sending of
Sh-Notif messages for an alias of that IMS Public User Identity to any
AS that is subscribed to Notifications for updates to the service data
for that alias of the received IMS Public User Identity (see clause
6.1.4).

\- If Service Data element is not present in the Sh-Update Req, the data
stored in the repository at the HSS shall be removed, and as a
consequence the Service Indication and the Sequence Number associated
with the removed data shall also be removed. This triggers the sending
of Sh-Notif messages with that Service Indication and Sequence Number to
be deleted but with an absent Service Data element, to any other ASs
that are subscribed to Notifications for updates to the service data for
that IMS Public User Identity or Public Service identity (see 6.1.4).
After sending Sh-Notif messages, the subscriptions to Notifications for
the removed Repository Data shall be deleted.

\- If repository data identified by the Service-Indication is not stored
for the IMS Public User Identity, IMS Public User Identity group or
Public Service Identity i.e. the Sh-Update Req intends to create a new
repository data, check whether or not the Sequence Number in the
Sh-Update Req is 0.

\- If the sequence number is not set to 0, Experimental-Result shall be
set to DIAMETER\_ERROR\_TRANSPARENT\_DATA\_OUT\_OF\_SYNC

\- If the sequence number is set to 0 check whether Service Data is
included within the Sh-Update Req.

\- If Service Data is not present in the Sh-Update Req, then
Experimental-Result shall be set to
DIAMETER\_ERROR\_OPERATION\_NOT\_ALLOWED and the operation shall be
ignored by the HSS.

\- If Service Data element is present in the Sh-Update Req, check
whether or not the size of the data is greater than that which the HSS
is prepared to accept.

\- If there is more data than the HSS is prepared to accept then
Experimental‑Result shall be set to DIAMETER\_ERROR\_TOO\_MUCH\_DATA and
the new data shall be discarded.

\- If the HSS is prepared to accept the data included in the Sh-Update
Req, then the data shall be stored in the data repository in the HSS.

If the HSS receives a request to update data other than Repository Data
while a previous update request of the same data for the same user
identity is still in progress, the HSS should stop processing the later
request and set the Experimental-Result-Code to
DIAMETER\_PRIOR\_UPDATE\_IN\_PROGRESS.

NOTE 3: If the HSS receives a request to update data other than
Repository Data while a previous update request of the same data for the
same user identity is still in progress, it identifies either an AS or
network misbehavior. If the HSS processed those requests it could cause
a network unexpected behaviour.

If there is an error in any of the above steps then the HSS shall stop
processing and shall return the error code specified in the respective
step (see 3GPP TS 29.329 \[5\] and 3GPP TS 29.229 \[7\] for an
explanation of the error codes).

If the HSS cannot fulfil the received request for reasons not stated in
the above steps, e.g. due to database error, it shall stop processing
the request and set Result-Code to DIAMETER\_UNABLE\_TO\_COMPLY.

If the HSS and the AS support the Update-Eff feature, the Sh Update is
successful only if it is successful for the update of all the repository
data instances in the request. Otherwise the HSS shall keep or restore
all the stored repository data as they were before receiving the Sh
Update request. If the error occurs during the steps 5 or 6 and if there
were several repository data instances in the request, the Sh Update
response shall contain a Repository Data ID indicating the service
indication and the sequence number of (one of) the repository data
instance(s) for which an error occurred.

If the HSS and the AS support the Update-Eff-Enhance feature, the Sh
Update is successful only if it is successful for the update of all the
data instances in the request. Otherwise the HSS shall keep or restore
all the stored data as they were before receiving the Sh Update request.
If an error occurs during the steps 5 or 6 with any of the data instance
in the request, the Sh Update response shall contain the corresponding
Data Reference indicating the first data instance for which an error
occurred. If there were several repository data instances in the
request, the HSS shall behave the same as specified for Update-Eff
feature.

Otherwise, the requested operation shall take place and the HSS shall
return the Result-Code AVP set to DIAMETER\_SUCCESS.

NOTE 4: When an AS receives
DIAMETER\_ERROR\_TRANSPARENT\_DATA\_OUT\_OF\_SYNC the AS may attempt to
resolve the inconsistency between the version of the repository data
that it holds and that stored at the HSS. It may execute a Sh-Pull to
retrieve the current version of the data from the HSS or it may wait to
receive a subsequent Sh-Notif message from the HSS for the affected
repository data.

### 6.1.3 Subscription to notifications (Sh-Subs-Notif)

This procedure is used between the AS and the HSS. The procedure is
invoked by the AS and is used:

\- To subscribe to Notifications for when particular transparent and/or
non-transparent data for a specified IMS Public User Identity or Public
Service Identity is updated, from the HSS.

\- Optionally to request the user data from the HSS in the same
operation.

This procedure is mapped to the commands
Subscribe-Notifications-Request/Answer in the Diameter application
specified in 3GPP TS 29.329 \[5\]. Tables 6.1.3.1 and 6.1.3.2 detail the
information elements involved.

#### 6.1.3.1 Detailed behaviour

The HSS shall take note of the subscription request on the data
identified by User Identity and Data-Reference. If notifications on
changes of repository data are requested, Service-Indication shall be
present in the request. If notifications on changes of filter criteria
are requested, the Server-Name AVP shall be used as key to the filter
criteria. If the request contains a specific Public Service Identity
matching a Wildcarded PSI, the HSS shall interpret that the subscription
refers to the information associated to the Wildcarded PSI. The
Server-Name AVP shall contain the SIP URL of the AS sending the request.
If notifications on changes of DSAI are requested, the DSAI-Tag AVP
shall be used as key of the DSAI whose changes are to be monitored.

Upon reception of the Sh-Subs-Notif request, the HSS shall, in the
following order (if there is an error in any of the following steps the
HSS shall stop processing and return the corresponding error code, see
3GPP TS 29.329 \[5\] and 3GPP TS 29.229 \[7\]), process the hereafter
steps that, unless otherwise stated, apply both for the Subscription
request type information element indicating the request is to subscribe
or to unsubscribe:

1\. In the AS permission list (see clause 6.2) the HSS shall check that
the AS is allowed to subscribe to notifications (Sh-Subs-Notif) for the
requested data by checking the combination of the identity of the AS
sending the request (identified by the Origin-Host AVP) and the supplied
Data-Reference.

> \- If this AS does not have Sh-Subs-Notif permission for the data
> referenced, Experimental-Result shall be set to
> DIAMETER\_ERROR\_USER\_DATA\_CANNOT\_BE\_NOTIFIED in the Sh-Subs-Notif
> Response.

2\. The HSS shall check that the User Identity in the request exists in
HSS. If not, Experimental-Result shall be set to
DIAMETER\_ERROR\_USER\_UNKNOWN in the Sh-Subs-Notif Response.

2a. Check if the Private Identity (if received) corresponds to
IMPU/MSISDN/External Identifier received in User-Identity. If not,
Experimental-Result-Code shall be set to
DIAMETER\_ERROR\_IDENTITIES\_DONT\_MATCH.

3\. If the type of the User Identity (i.e. IMS Public User Identity or
Public Service Identity or MSISDN or External Identifier) does not apply
according to Table 7.6.1 as access key for the Data-Reference (if
Notif-Eff is in use: for all the Data-References) indicated in the
request, Experimental-Result shall be set to
DIAMETER\_ERROR\_OPERATION\_NOT\_ALLOWED in the Sh-Subs-Notif Response.

3a. If Data-Reference is DSAI (19), check whether or not, for the Public
Identity, there is an instance of DSAI matching the DSAI-Tag contained
in the Sh-Subs-Notif command. If not, Experimental-Result shall be set
to DIAMETER\_ERROR\_DSAI\_NOT\_AVAILABLE.

4\. If the Sh-Subs-Notif Request contains an Expiry Time, the HSS should
also include in the Sh-Subs-Notif Response an Expiry Time IE with the
absolute time at which the subscription expires in the case of a
successful subscription. This time may be earlier than the requested
expiry time. If the HSS includes this IE, then no notification shall be
sent to the AS after the expiration time. If the HSS receives a
Sh-Subs-Notif Request without the Expiry Time IE, the HSS should treat
it as a request for an unlimited subscription.

If the HSS does not include this IE in the response, that indicates an
unlimited subscription.

If a subsequent request is received by the HSS where the Expiry Time IE
is present but different from what the HSS has previously stored, the
HSS should replace the stored expiration time with what was received in
the request.

5\. If Data-Reference is RepositoryData(0) and the transparent data
associated with the Service Indication does not exist in the HSS (i.e.
Service Data is not present), then Experimental-Result shall be set to
DIAMETER\_ERROR\_SUBS\_DATA\_ABSENT.

6\. If the Subscription request type information element indicates that
this is a request to subscribe, the HSS shall associate the Application
Server Identity with the list of entities that need to be notified when
the data identified by the request is modified and set the Result-Code
to DIAMETER\_SUCCESS in the Sh-Subs-Notify response. If the Subscription
request type information element indicates that this is a request to
unsubscribe, the HSS shall remove the association of the Application
Server Identity with the same list. In this last case, the Result-Code
shall be set to DIAMETER\_SUCCESS if the operation is successful or if
the Application Server Identity was not present in the list.

7\. If the HSS and AS supports the Notif-Eff feature and if multiple
Data-Reference AVPs occur in the Sh-Subs-Notif Request, each
Data-Reference shall be treated as a request to establish a separate
notification request. When multiple notification requests are requested,
and all of them succeed, the HSS shall set the Result-Code to
DIAMETER\_SUCCESS in the Sh-Subs-Notify response. If one of them is
unsuccessful, the HSS shall return the Result code with the relevant
Diameter error indication and come back to the situation regarding to
subscriptions as before the reception of the Sh-Subs-Notif Request.

8\. If the HSS and the AS supports the Notif-Eff feature and if multiple
Service-Indication AVPs occur in the Sh-Subs-Notif Request, each
Service-Indication shall be treated as a request to establish a separate
notification request for change of Transparent data. When multiple
notification requests are requested, and all of them are successful, the
HSS shall return the Result-Code set to DIAMETER\_SUCCESS in the
Sh-Subs-Notify response. If one of them is unsuccessful, the HSS shall
return the Result code with the relevant Diameter error value and come
back to the situation regarding to subscriptions as before the reception
of the Sh-Subs-Notif Request.

8a. If the HSS and the AS supports the Notif-Eff feature and if
different Identity-Set AVPs occur in the Sh-Subs-Notif Request, each
Identity-Set shall be treated as a request to establish a separate
notification request. When multiple notification requests are requested,
and all of them are successful, the HSS shall return the Result-Code set
to DIAMETER\_SUCCESS in the Sh-Subs-Notify response. If one of them is
unsuccessful, the HSS shall return the Result code with the relevant
Diameter error value and come back to the situation regarding to
subscriptions as before the reception of the Sh-Subs-Notif Request.

9\. If the Send Data Indication information element is present in the
request and the HSS supports the return of the User-Data in this
request, check whether or not the data that is requested to be
downloaded by the AS is currently being updated by another entity. If
there is an update of the data in progress, the HSS may delay the
response until the update has been completed. The HSS shall ensure that
the data returned is not corrupted by this conflict.

10\. If the Send Data Indication information element is present in the
request, the HSS should include the data pertinent to the requested Data
Reference in the User-Data AVP and if the HSS supports the Notif-Eff
feature, the HSS should include the data pertinent to all the requested
Data References in the User-Data AVP. The HSS shall set the Result-Code
to DIAMETER\_SUCCESS. This includes cases where the data is not
available to the HSS and an empty tag is included as follows.

\- Unavailable elements of Sh IMS Data shall be indicated as follows.

\- An unavailable S-CSCF name shall be indicated with empty SCSCFName
element.

\- If all iFCs for the user that are relevant for the AS are unavailable
it shall be indicated with empty IFCs element.

\- Similarly for PSI activation information.

If the HSS cannot fulfil the received request for reasons not stated in
the above steps, e.g. due to database error, it shall stop processing
the request and set Result-Code to DIAMETER\_UNABLE\_TO\_COMPLY.

### 6.1.4 Notifications (Sh-Notif)

This procedure is used between the HSS and the AS. The procedure is
invoked by the HSS and is used:

\- To inform the AS of changes in transparent and/or non-transparent
data to which the AS has previously subscribed to receive Notifications
for, using Sh-Subs-Notif (see 6.1.3).

This procedure is mapped to the commands
Push-Notification-Request/Answer in the Diameter application specified
in 3GPP TS 29.329 \[5\]. Tables 6.1.4.1 and 6.1.4.2 detail the involved
information elements.

#### 6.1.4.1 Detailed behaviour

The keys to the updated data are part of the information element
User-Data AVP. When data repository is updated Service-Indication and
Sequence Number shall also be part of the information element User-Data.

Since authentication pending is a transient state of normally very short
duration, notification of an IMS user\'s state change, to and from the
authentication pending state shall not be sent to Application Servers,
when the previous state before authentication pending and next state
after authentication pending are the same. If the states are different
before the authentication pending state is entered and after the
authentication pending state is left then notification is sent to the AS
of this new state.

If the HSS and AS supports the Notif-Eff feature and if multiple
subscriptions to notifications are associated with a Public User
Identity, the HSS may combine the notifications for multiple Data
References and Service Indications into a single notification message.

If the HSS supports the Update-Eff and Notif-Eff features, the HSS may
generate only one notification message to be sent to the AS(s)
supporting the Notif-eff feature, grouping the data changes
notifications according to the subscribed notifications and the
resulting successful achievement of a Sh-Update procedure with multiple
repository data instances, from an AS that supports the Update-Eff
feature. This notification message may also include other notifications
as described with the Notif-Eff feature.

Removal of the subscribed data is indicated with the content of
User-Data AVP. The content shall be compliant with the XML-schema
defined in Annex D. Removed repository data shall be indicated with
RepositoryData element that does not contain ServiceData element.
Removed S-CSCF name shall be indicated with empty SCSCFName element.
Removed IP Address Secure Binding Information shall be indicated with
empty IPv4Addres, or IPv6Prefix and/ or IPv6 interface element
respectively. If all iFCs for the user that are relevant for the AS have
been removed it shall be indicated with empty IFCs element.

Removal of Public Identity for which the AS has any active subscription
shall be indicated in the DeletedIdentities element.

If One-Time-Notification AVP was included by the AS in Sh-Subs-Notif,
the HSS shall remove the related subscription information after sending
Sh-Notif, i.e. no subsequent notifications shall be sent to AS.

Notifications shall include the data updated for the received
IMPU/MSISDN/External Identifier and Private Identity (if present).

> NOTE: Data referred to a Private Identity (e.g. IMS Private User
> Identity) implies that only the data (e.g. UE reachability) specific
> for that Private Identity is included, regardless of the type of User
> Identity received (e.g. IMS Public User Identity shared by multiple
> IMS Private User Identities).

Table 6.1.4.1 details the valid result codes that the AS can return in
the response.

Table 6.1.4.1.1: Sh-Notif response valid result codes

  ---------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Result-Code AVP value                          Condition
  DIAMETER\_SUCCESS                              The request succeeded.
  DIAMETER\_ERROR\_USER\_DATA\_NOT\_RECOGNIZED   The request failed. The AS informs the HSS that the received user information contained information, which was not recognized or supported by the AS.
  DIAMETER\_ERROR\_USER\_UNKNOWN                 The request failed because the Public Identity or MSISDN or External Identifier is not found in the AS.
  DIAMETER\_ERROR\_TOO\_MUCH\_DATA               The request failed. The AS informs the HSS that it tried to push too much data into the AS.
  DIAMETER\_ERROR\_NO\_SUBSCRIPTION\_TO\_DATA    The request failed. The AS informs the HSS that the notification refers to information to which the AS is not subscribed.
  DIAMETER\_UNABLE\_TO\_COMPLY                   The request failed.
  ---------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If DIAMETER\_ERROR\_USER\_UNKNOWN is received in the Sh-Notif response,
the HSS shall remove all of the subscription to notification information
subscribed by the AS related to the specific User Identity.

6.2 AS permissions list
-----------------------

In table 7.6.1, the contents of the Data-AVP are described. Some of the
individual elements carried within Data-AVP may be requested by the AS
from the HSS using the Sh-Pull command (see clause 6.1.1) or may be
updated at the HSS by the AS using the Sh-Update command (see clause
6.1.2). The AS may also request that the HSS notifies the AS of changes
to specific elements within the Data-AVP using the Sh-Subs-Notif command
(see clause 6.1.3). The HSS will only allow these operations to take
place if the element of the Data-AVP is permitted to be included in the
specific command requested by the AS, as indicated in table 7.6.1.

To manage whether an AS may request each element of Data-AVP with a
specific command, the HSS shall maintain a list of AS permissions (the
\'AS Permissions List\'). AS permissions are identified by AS identity
and Data Reference with the possible permissions associated with each
Data Reference being Sh-Pull, Sh-Update, Sh-Subs-Notif or any
combination of these permissions (see table 7.6.1 for details of which
permissions are allowed for each Data Reference). The permissions apply
to all users served by the HSS, they are not user specific. When an AS
requests Sh-Pull, Sh-Update or Sh-Subs-Notif the HSS shall check
permissions and return an error result if the AS does not have the
required permission. If the AS permissions change in a later stage, i.e.
the AS does not longer have the required permission, the HSS shall
remove all the subscription to notifications for the AS for which
required permissions have been prohibited.

6.4 Void

6.5 User identity to HSS resolution
-----------------------------------

The User identity to HSS resolution mechanism enables the AS to find the
identity of the HSS that holds the subscriber data for a given IMS
Public User Identity or Public Service Identity when multiple and
separately addressable HSSs have been deployed by the network operator.
The resolution mechanism is not required in networks that utilise a
single HSS or when an AS is configured to use pre-defined HSS.

The resolution mechanism described in 3GPP TS 23.228 \[1\] shall use a
Subscription Locator Function (SLF) or a Diameter Proxy Agent.

The AS accesses the SLF via the Dh interface. The Dh interface shall
always be used in conjunction with the Sh interface. The Dh interface
shall be based on the Diameter base protocol as specified in
IETF RFC 6733 \[44\]. The SLF functionality shall use the routing
mechanism provided by an enhanced Diameter redirect agent.

The SLF or the Diameter Proxy Agent shall be to determine the HSS
identity.

To get the HSS identity the AS shall send the Sh request normally
destined to the HSS to a pre-configured Diameter address/name.

\- If this Sh Request is received by an SLF (acting as a Diameter
redirect agent), the SLF shall determine the HSS address and shall send
to the AS a notification of redirection towards the HSS identity, in
response to the Sh request. Multiple HSS identities may be included in
the response, as specified in IETF RFC 6733 \[44\]. In such a case, the
AS shall send the Sh Request to the first HSS identity in the ordered
list received in the Sh Response from the SLF. If the AS does not
receive a successful response to the Sh Request, the AS shall send a Sh
Request to the next HSS identity in the ordered list. This procedure
shall be repeated until a successful response from an HSS is received.

\- If this Sh Request is received by the Diameter Proxy Agent, the
Diameter Proxy Agent shall determine the HSS identity based on the
provided user identity and - if the Diameter load control mechanism is
supported (see IETF RFC 8583 \[43\]) - optionally also based on
previously received load values from Load AVPs of type HOST. The
Diameter Proxy Agent shall then forward the Sh request directly to the
determined HSS. The AS shall determine the HSS identity from the
response to the Sh request received from the HSS.

The AS should store the HSS identity/name/Realm and shall use it in
further Sh requests associated to the same IMS Public Identity.

In networks where the use of the user identity to HSS resolution
mechanism is required and the AS is not configured to use a predefined
HSS, each AS shall be configured with the pre-configured address/name of
the SLF or the Diameter Proxy Agent to enable use of these resolution
mechanisms.

### 7.1.1 IMS Public User Identity / Public Service Identity

This information element contains an IMS Public User Identity / Public
Service Identity (either SIP URI or tel URI). See 3GPP 23.003 \[11\].

### 7.1.2 MSISDN

This information element contains the MSISDN, or the Basic MSISDN if
multinumbering is used (see 3GPP TS 23.012 \[19\]).

### 7.1.3 External Identifier

This information element contains the External Identifier (see
3GPP TS 23.003 \[11\]).

7.1A Wildcarded PSI
-------------------

This information element contains a Wildcarded PSI that is hosted by an
application server. For definition of a Wildcarded PSI, see 3GPP TS
23.003 \[11\].

7.1B Wildcarded Public User Identity
------------------------------------

This information element contains a Wildcarded Public User Identity that
is stored in the HSS. For definition of a Wildcarded Public User
Identity, see 3GPP TS 23.003 \[11\].

7.2 Requested Domain
--------------------

This information element details the access domains for which certain
data (e.g. user state, location information) are requested. See 3GPP TS
29.329 \[5\] for the list of possible values.

7.2A Requested Nodes
--------------------

This information element details the access node types for which certain
data (e.g. user state, location information) are requested. See 3GPP TS
29.329 \[5\] for the list of possible values.

7.2B Serving Node Indication
----------------------------

This information element indicates that the sender does not require any
location information other than the serving node address/identity (i.e.
MME name and/or SGSN number, or VLR number) for the requested domain and
the requested nodes (if included). Other location information (e.g.
Global Cell ID, Tracking Area ID) may be absent.

This information element is only applicable to Location Information.

7.3 Requested Data 
------------------

\- Reference to the data that an AS is requesting from the HSS.

\- Reference to the data which, an AS wants to be notified of, when
changed.

\- Reference to data for which subscription to notification of change is
rejected.

\- Reference to data for which updates are required.

\- Reference to data for which update fails.

See clause 7.6.

7.4 Service Indication
----------------------

Identifier of one set of service related transparent data, which is
stored in an HSS in an operator network per Public Identity. The HSS
shall allocate memory space to implement a data repository to store
transparent data per IMS Public User Identity or Public Service Identity
and value of Service Indication with a Sequence Number for verification.
For Public Service Identities matching a Wildcarded Public Service
Identity, the repository data shall be stored per Wildcarded Public
Service Identity and not for each specific Public Service Identity.

7.5 Result
----------

This information element contains the result code of the operation. See
3GPP TS 29.329 \[5\] for the list of possible values.

7.6 Data
--------

This information element contains an XML document conformant to the XML
schema defined in Annex D.

Annex C specifies the UML logical model of the data downloaded via the
Sh interface.

Table 7.6.1 defines the data reference values and tags, access key and
recommended AS permissions (as described in clause 6.2) for the
operation(s) on data accessible via the Sh interface, i.e. the listed
operation(s) in the Operations column are the only ones allowed to be
used with this Data Ref value. It is a matter of operator policy to
further restrict the AS permission rights defined in table 7.6.1.

An access key between square brackets is considered as optional, while
when more than one access key is separated by logical OR and included
between brackets, it means that one (and only one) of these access keys
is mandatory.

### 7.6.1 Repository Data

This information element contains transparent data. A data repository
may be shared by more than one AS implementing the same service.

### 7.6.2 IMSPublicIdentity

This data contents included in the Sh-Pull Resp, Sh-Subs-Notif Resp or
Sh-Notif depends on whether Requested Identity Set information element
was included in the Sh-Pull or Sh-Subs-Notif, as follows:

\- When this information element takes the value IMPLICIT\_IDENTITIES,
the HSS shall provide all non-barred IMS Public Identities that belong
to the same implicit registration set as the IMS Public Identity
included in the message in the User-Identity AVP. The MSISDN and
External Identifier within the User-Identity AVP are not applicable for
this value. If the User Identity is a Public Service Identity, the HSS
shall return only the User Identity received in the request.

\- When this information element takes the value ALIAS\_IDENTITIES, the
HSS shall provide all non-barred IMS Public User Identities that are in
the same Alias Public User Identity Set as the IMS Public User Identity
included in the message in the User-Identity AVP (see 3GPP TS 23.008
\[27\] for the definition of Alias Public User Identity Set). The
MSISDN, the Public Service Identity and the External Identifier within
the User-Identity AVP are not applicable for this value.

\- When this information element takes the value REGISTERED\_IDENTITIES,
the HSS shall provide all non-barred IMS Public Identities whose state
is registered, belonging to all Private Identities that the IMS Public
Identity or MSISDN or External Identifier in the User-Identity AVP is
associated with. If the User Identity is a Public Service Identity, the
HSS shall return no identities in the response.

\- When this information element takes the value ALL\_IDENTITIES, the
HSS shall provide all non-barred IMS Public Identities, belonging to all
Private Identities that the User Identity is associated with.

\- When this information element is not included, the HSS shall download
the set of IMS Public Identities that would be downloaded if the value
of this information element had been ALL\_IDENTITIES.

An IMS Public Identity would be either:

\- associated with the same Private User Identity or Private Service
Identity as the User Identity included in the request or

\- associated with the MSISDN present in the request or

\- associated with an External Identifier present in the request.

Multiple instances of this information element may be included in the
message.

### 7.6.3 IMS User State

This information element contains the IMS User State of the public
identifier referenced. Its possible values are:

\- REGISTERED,

\- NOT\_REGISTERED,

\- AUTHENTICATION\_PENDING,

\- REGISTERED\_UNREG\_SERVICES.

If the IMS Public User Identity is shared between multiple Private User
Identities, HSS shall indicate the most registered state of the shared
IMS Public User Identity to an AS. The most registered state of a shared
IMS Public User Identity is defined as follows:

\- If the shared IMS Public User Identity is registered with any of the
Private User Identities, the most registered state of the shared IMS
Public User Identity is REGISTERED.

\- If the shared IMS Public User Identity is not currently registered
with any of the Private User Identities, but it is in state
REGISTERED\_UNREG\_SERVICES, then the most registered state of the
shared IMS Public User Identity is REGISTERED\_UNREG\_SERVICES.

\- If the shared IMS Public User Identity is not currently registered
with any of the Private User Identities, and it is not in state
REGISTERED\_UNREG\_SERVICES, but it is in the process of being
authenticated with any of the Private User Identities, then the most
registered state of the shared IMS Public User Identity is
AUTHENTICATION\_PENDING.

\- If the shared IMS Public User Identity is not currently registered
with any of the Private User Identities, and it is not in state
REGISTERED\_UNREG\_SERVICES, and it is not in the process of being
authenticated with any of the Private User Identities, then the most
registered state of the shared IMS Public User Identity is
NOT\_REGISTERED.

### 7.6.4 S-CSCF Name

This information element contains the name of the S‑CSCF assigned to the
IMS Subscription.

### 7.6.5 Initial Filter Criteria

This information element contains the triggering information for a
service.

For a more detailed description, refer to 3GPP TS 23.218 \[4\] and 3GPP
TS 29.228 \[6\].

### 7.6.6 Location Information

This information element contains either:

\- the location of the served subscriber in the MSC/VLR if the requested
domain is CS, or

\- the location of the served subscriber in the SGSN if the requested
domain is PS and either the requested node is solely SGSN or the
requested node is not present, or

\- the location of the served subscriber in the MME if the requested
domain is PS and the requested nodes is solely MME, or

\- the locations of the served subscriber in the 3GPP AAA Server for
TWAN if the requested domain is PS and the requested nodes is solely
3GPP AAA SERVER for TWAN, or

\- the location of the served subscriber in the AMF (for 3GPP access) if
the requested domain is PS and the requested nodes is solely AMF.

\- the locations of the served subscriber in the MME and the SGSN and
3GPP AAA Server for TWAN and AMF if the requested domain is PS and the
requested nodes are all of MME and SGSN and 3GPP AAA SERVER for TWAN and
AMF, or

\- the locations of the served subscriber in any of the two or three
serving nodes among the MME, the SGSN, the 3GPP AAA Server for TWAN and
the AMF if the requested domain is PS and the requested nodes indicates
the corresponding nodes for which the location are to be requested.

If the HSS has to communicate with the MSC/VLR or SGSN and/or MME and/or
3GPP AAA Server and/or AMF (via UDM) to retrieve location information,
it shall make use of the service MAP-PROVIDE-SUBSCRIBER-INFO or
S6a/S6d-IDR or SWx-PPR or make use (via UDM) of the Namf Service-Based
Interface services. This information element shall contain the location
information as received from the access nodes.

If the HSS or HSS/UDM cannot communicate with the VLR or SGSN or MME or
AMF (e.g., because the UE is purged), or if the HSS or HSS/UDM cannot
retrieve the location information from the serving nodes because they do
not support such feature, the HSS shall provide locally stored location
information if available (e.g., serving node name, Visited PLMN ID)
received in a previous Update Location message, and the last known UE\'s
location if available e.g. as received in the Purge message from VLR or
SGSN or MME or AMF.

If the Serving Node Indication was present in the request, the location
information shall contain the serving node address(es) as stored in the
HSS, according to the requested domain and the requested nodes (if
received). Other location information may be absent, in order to
eliminate unnecessary communication with the MSC/VLR or SGSN and/or MME
and/or 3GPP AAA Server and/or AMF when the AS does not require these
information elements.

For both Location Information for CS and Location Information for GPRS,
the considerations described in 3GPP TS 23.078 \[14\] apply.

### 7.6.7 User state

This information element indicates the state of the User Identity in the
domain/node indicated by the Requested-Domain/Requested-Node (see 7.2),
with the values specified in 3GPP TS 23.078 \[14\] for Subscriber State
and PS Domain Subscriber State, and with the values specified in 3GPP TS
29.272 \[31\] for EPS User State and 3GPP TS 29.518 \[47\] for the 5GS
User State.

\- The HSS shall make use of the operation MAP-PROVIDE-SUBSCRIBER-INFO
towards the MSC/VLR to obtain this information if the requested domain
is CS.

\- The HSS shall make use of the operation S6a-IDR towards the MME to
obtain this information if the requested domain is PS and the requested
node is MME.

\- The HSS shall make use of the operation MAP-PROVIDE-SUBSCRIBER-INFO
or S6d-IDR towards the SGSN to obtain this information if the requested
domain is PS and either the requested node is SGSN or the requested node
is not present.

\- The HSS shall make use of the operation S6a-IDR towards the MME and
MAP-PROVIDE-SUBSCRIBER-INFO or S6d-IDR towards the SGSN to obtain this
information if the requested domain is PS and the Requested Nodes is MME
and SGSN.

\- The UDM+HSS shall make use of the Namf\_EventExposure Subscribe
Service Operation towards the AMF to obtain this information if the
requested domain is PS and the requested node is AMF.

This information element shall contain the information as received from
the access nodes.The UDM+HSS may retrieve the User States from the MME,
SGSN or AMF within one procedure.

The UDM+HSS shall include the value \"NotProvidedFromSGSN or MME or

### 7.6.8 Charging information

This information element contains the addresses of the charging
functions: primary Online Charging Function
(PrimaryEventChargingFunctionName), secondary Online Charging Function
(SecondaryEventChargingFunctionName), primary Charging Data Function
(PrimaryChargingCollectionFunctionName), and secondary Charging Data
Function (SecondaryChargingCollectionFunctionName). When a **clash
occurs between the charging function address(es) received over the ISC
interface and those received over the Sh interface, the address(es)
received over the ISC interface should take precedence.**

NOTE: The use of the Sh interface to retrieve charging function
addresses is not intended as a general-purpose alternative to receiving
charging function addresses from the ISC interfaces. Rather, it is meant
to address a special case where the AS needs to interact with the
charging system before initiating a request to a user when the AS has
not received the third party REGISTER for that user.

The AS shall extract the FQDN of the DiameterURI in these information
elements and may use it as content of the Destination-Host AVP for the
Diameter accounting requests. The parent domain of the FQDN in the
DiameterURI shall be used as Destination-Realm. The number of labels
used for the Destination-Realm shall be determined before the Charging
Information is provisioned and may be a configuration option.

NOTE: A FQDN is an absolute domain name including a subdomain and its
parent domain. The subdomain and the parent domain contain one or more
labels separated by dots.

### 7.6.9 MSISDN

This information element contains the MSISDN, or the Basic MSISDN if
multinumbering is used, that is associated with the User Identity
present in the request. See 3GPP TS 23.012 \[19\] for Basic MSISDN
definition.

Multiple instances of this information element shall only occur if the
Public User Identity is shared and no Private Identity was included in
the request, otherwise only one instance shall be included in the
message.

If Additional-MSISDN feature is supported by the HSS but the AS has
indicated that it does not support it, it is up to operator policy to
decide what information is returned by the HSS, either what is
provisioned in MSISDN or in Additional MSISDN (A-MSISDN).

### 7.6.9A Extended MSISDN

This information element is returned in addition to MSISDN if
Additional-MSISDN feature is supported by the HSS, the AS has indicated
as well its support and an Additional MSISDN (A-MSISDN) is provisioned..

It contains the Additional-MSISDN that is associated with the User
Identity present in the request.

All valid instances of this information element shall be included in the
message.

### 7.6.10 PSIActivation

This information element contains the activation state of the Public
Service Identity present in the request. Its possible values are:

\- ACTIVE,

\- INACTIVE.

### 7.6.11 DSAI

When a service is provisioned but not active, an Application Server is
typically involved through the ISC interface in sessions where the
Application Server is not supposed to perform any task but to proxy
incoming transactions.

In order to avoid this disoptimization, a mechanism is provided for the
Application Server to signal the HSS that a set of initial filter
criteria should be \"masked\" for a specific Public User Identity or
Public Service Identity. This is, from the Application Server\'s
perspective, just an indication, and an Application Server must be
prepared to be involved in sessions even if the trigger that caused its
involvement has been masked by that Application Server.

This information element contains the activation state of a Service
(identified by its DSAI-tag, see clause 7.14, for a specific user
identified by a Public User Identity or of a Service identified by its
PSI). Its possible values are:

\- ACTIVE,

\- INACTIVE.

In the HSS the DSAI can also be associated to a wildcarded PSI. In that
case, there is a set of identities matching a specific wildcarded PSI
and all the identities in the set share the same DSAIs. Any change in
these DSAIs masked from a single identity of the set will apply to all
the identities associated to that wildcarded PSI.

Each DSAI is implicitly bound to a list of (at least one) initial filter
criteria. The binding is not exclusive, i.e. one instance of initial
filter criteria may be bound to zero or more DSAIs, however all the iFCs
bound to a given DSAI should trigger to the same AS (i.e. they should
share the same ServerName), which is the only one allowed to update it.

An instance of initial filter criteria shall be included into the
Service-Profile sent through the Cx Interface according to the
operations described in 3GPP TS 29.228 \[6\] if at least one of the
following conditions applies:

\- No DSAI is bound to those initial filter criteria;

\- At least one of the DSAIs bound to those initial filter criteria is
set to ACTIVE.

### 7.6.12 Void

### 7.6.13 Service Level Trace Information

This information element contains the Service Level Tracing Information
(see 3GPP TS 24.323 \[45\]) that is related to a specific Public
Identifier. If the ServiceLevelTraceInfo is present, service level
tracing shall be enabled in the Application Server for the related
Public Identifier according to the configuration data received. If the
ServiceLevelTraceInfo is not present, service level tracing is disabled
in the Application Server for the related Public Identifier.

B.1.1 Data Update, Registration, Notification Subscription.
-----------------------------------------------------------

Figure B.1.1: Data Update, Registration, Notification Subscription

1\. A user subscribes to a new service. The operator provisions the
service in an AS. The AS stores some service data for a user in the HSS,
Sh-Update (user identity, updated data) e.g. repository data.

2\. HSS confirms the data is updated

3\. Some time later, user registers with the network

4\. S-CSCF downloads the data from the HSS (during the procedure S-CSCF
Registration Notification on Cx interface). Filter criteria specify that
the AS wants to be notified that the end user is registered.

5\. 200 OK

6\. S-CSCF sends third party registration message to the application
server to notify that user is registered.

7\. 200 OK

8\. The AS subscribes to notifications and downloads data needed for
providing service from HSS, by means of Sh-Subs-Notif (user identity,
requested data, service information and send data indication).

9\. HSS confirms the subscription request and sends data to AS

10\. At some moment, the AS decides to update user\'s service data e.g.
repository data in the HSS, by means of Sh-Update (user identity,
updated data).

11\. The HSS confirms the service data is updated.

12\. At some moment, user data is updated in the HSS. As the AS
subscribed to notifications (step 8), the HSS sends to the AS the
requested updates, by means of Sh-Notif (user identity, updated data).

13\. The AS acknowledges the notification.

########  Annex C (informative): UML model of the data downloaded over Sh interface

The purpose of this UML model is to define in an abstract level the
structure of the data downloaded over the Sh interface and describe the
purpose of the different information classes included in it.

C.1 General description
=======================

The following picture gives an outline of the UML model of the user
profile, which is exchanged between the HSS and an AS:

Figure C.1.1: Sh-Data

Class Sh-Data contains the following attributes:

\- An optional instance of CSUserState attribute.

\- An optional instance of PSUserState attribute.

\- An optional instance of IMSI attribute.

\- Zero or more instances of IMSPrivateUserIdentity attribute.

\- An optional instance of IMEISV attribute.

Class Sh-Data contains the following classes:

\- An optional instance of the class PublicIdentifiers.

\- Zero or moreinstances of the class RepositoryData.

\- An optional instance of the class Sh-IMS-Data.

\- An optional instance of the class CSLocationInformation.

\- An optional instance of the class PSLocationInformation.

\- An optional instance of the class RegisteredIdentities.

\- An optional instance of the class ImplicitIdentities.

\- An optional instance of the class AllIdentities.

\- An optional instance of the class AliasIdentities.

\- An optional instance of the class DeletedIdentities.

If the AS and the HSS both support the Notif-Eff feature and the AS
requires to read more than one Identity Sets of a Public Identity, or
regardless whether or not the Notif-Eff feature is supported, the AS has
subscribed to be notifed of changes to IMSPublicIdentity for more than
one Identity Sets (see table 7.6.1), the class PublicIdentifiers shall
not be used to convey IMS Public Identities (it shall however still be
used to convey the MSISDNs if so requested). Instead the classes
RegisteredIdentities, ImplicitIdentities, AllIdentities and
AliasIdentities shall be used and they contain the
REGISTERED\_IDENTITIES, IMPLICIT\_IDENTITIES, ALL\_IDENTITIES and
ALIAS\_IDENTITIES associated with the IMS Public Identity included in
the request respectively. See clause 7.6.2 for the detailed information.
The class PublicIdentifiers or the one among the four which may be used
to contain the corresponding identity set can both be used to convey IMS
Public Identities when AS requires only one identity set of a public
identity.

If Public Identity(ies) are deleted and the AS has any subscription
active for the deleted identity(ies), the HSS shall notify the AS of the
deletion of the identity(ies) using the class DeletedIdentities.

Class RepositoryData contains repository data (transparent data) for a
given service that are associated to a Public user Identity or a group
of alias Public User Identities. It has attributes ServiceIndication,
SequenceNumber and ServiceData.

Class CSUserState contains the state of a user in the CS domain. Its
only attribute, State, is an enumeration whose possible values are
defined in clause 7.6.7.

Class PSUserState contains the state of a user in the PS domain (SGSN).
Its only attribute, State, is an enumeration whose possible values are
defined in clause 7.6.7.

NOTE: the fact that attribute State is an enumeration is a difference
from what can be carried in the MAP protocol.

Class EPSUserState contains the state of a user in the PS domain (MME).
Its only attribute, State, is an enumeration whose possible values are
defined in clause 7.6.7. .

Class Sh-5GSUserState contains the state of a user in the PS domain
(AMF). Its only attribute, State, is an enumeration whose possible
values are defined in clause 7.6.7.

Class CSLocationInformation has the attributes LocationNumber,
ServiceAreaID, CellGlobalId, LocationAreaId, GeographicalInformation,
GeodeticInformation, VLRNumber, MSCNumber, AgeOfLocationInformation,
CurrentLocationRetrieved, UserCSGInformation, TrackingAreaId,
E-UTRANCellGlobalId and LocalTimeZone. They are defined in 7.6.

Class PSLocationInformation has the attributes ServiceAreaId,
CellGlobalId, LocationAreaID, RoutingAreaID, GeographicalInformation,
GeodeticInformation, SGSNNumber, AgeOfLocationInformation,
CurrentLocationRetrieved, UserCSGInformation, VisitedPLMNID,
LocalTimeZone and RATtype. They are defined in 7.6.

Class EPSLocationInformation has the attributes E-UTRANCellGlobalId,
TrackingAreaID, GeographicalInformation, GeodeticInformation, MMEName,
AgeOfLocationInformation, CurrentLocationRetrieved, UserCSGInformation,
VisitedPLMNID, LocalTimeZone and RATtype. They are defined in 7.6.

Class TWANLocationInformation has the attributes TWAN-SSID, TWAN-BSSID,
TWAN-PLMNID, CivicAddress, TWANOperatorName, LocalTimeZone and
LogicalAccessID. They are defined in 7.6.

Class Sh-5GSLocationInformation has the attributes NRCellGlobalId,
E-UTRANCellGlobalId, TrackingAreaID, GeographicalInformation,
AMFAddress, SMSFAddress, AgeOfLocationInformation,
CurrentLocationRetrieved, VisitedPLMNID, LocalTimeZone and RATtype. They
are defined in 7.6.

Class DeletedIdentities contains Public Identities (IMS Public User
Identities or Public Service Identities) removed from the HSS.

Class UEReachabilityForIP contains the UE reachability for IP. Its
attributes, UEIPReachabilityMME, UEIPReachabilitySGSN,
UEIPReachabilityAMF3GPP and UEIPReachabilityAMFnon3GPP are enumerations
whose possible values are defined in clause 7.6.17.

Class IMSVoiceOverPSSessionsSupport contains the support of IMS voice
over PS at the current access. Its only attribute, SupportIndication, is
an enumeration whose possible values are defined in clause 7.6.18.

Class IMSI contains the UE\'s IMSI. See clause 7.6.24.

Class IMSPrivateUserIdentity contains an IMS Private Identity associated
with the IMS Public Identity included in the request.

 C.2 PublicIdentifiers
---------------------

The following picture details the UML model of the class
PublicIdentifiers:

Figure C.2.1: The UML model of the class PublicIdentifiers

Class PublicIdentifiers contains the following attributes:

\- Zero or more instances of IMSPublicIdentity attribute. Each instance
is a Public Identity. See clause 7.6.2 for information about contents.

\- An optional instance of IdentityType attribute. If only one instance
of IMSPublicIdentity attribute is included, then this attribute
identifies the identity type in the IMSPublicIdentity attribute, it
could be either:

\- A distinct Public User Identity

\- A distinct Public Service Identity

If more than one instance of IMSPublicIdentity attribute is included,
this attribute is assumed to apply to all of them.

If IdentityType attribute is not present, it is assumed to be a distinct
Public User Identity.

If more than one instance of IMSPublicIdentity shall be returned, if the
identities are of different types the EnhancedIMSPublicIdentifiers class
should be used instead.

\- An optional instance of WilcardedPSI attribute, if the Public Service
Identity in the request matches a Wildcarded PSI.

NOTE: This attribute can be omitted if this information is conveyed
including Wildcarded PSI information element in the response. See clause
6.1.1 and 6.1.3.

\- An optional instance of WilcardedIMPU attribute, if the Public User
Identity in the request matches a Wildcarded IMPU.

NOTE: This attribute can be omitted if this information is conveyed
including Wildcarded Public User Identity information element in the
response. See clause 6.1.1 and 6.1.3.

\- Zero or more instances of MSISDN attribute, that contains an MSISDN.

Class PublicIdentifiers contains the following classes:

\- Zero to more instances of EnhancedIMSPublicIdentifiers. This class is
required when more than one instance of IMSPublicIdentity shall be
returned and the identities are of different types. See clause 7.6.2 for
more information about contents. It includes the following attributes:

\- One instance of IMSPublicIdentity attribute that contains a Public
Identity.

\- One instance of the IdentityType attribute that identifies the
identity type in the IMSPublicIdentity attribute, it could be either:

\- A distinct Public User Identity

\- A distinct Public Service Identity

\- A Wildcarded Public Service Identity

\- A Wildcarded Public User Identity

\- Zero or more instances of ExtendedMSISDN, only when Additional-MSISDN
feature is enabled. It includes the following attributes:

\- One instance of MSISDN attribute that contains an MSISDN.

\- One instance of MSISDNType attribute that indicates the MSISDN Type.

########  Annex D (normative): XML schema for the Sh interface user profile

The file ShDataType\_Rel15.xsd, attached to this specification, contains
the XML schema for the user profile that is sent over the Sh interface.
The user profile XML schema defines the data types that are used in the
user profile XML.\
The data that is allowed to be sent in the user profile may vary
depending on the features supported by the Diameter end points, see 3GPP
TS 29.329 \[5\]. The user profile XML schema file is intended to be used
by an XML parser.\
The version of the Sh application sending the user profile XML shall be
the same as the version of the sent user profile XML and thus it implies
the version of the user profile XML schema to be used to validate it.

Tables D.1 and D.2 describe the data types and the dependencies among
them that configure the user profile XML schema.

######## Annex E (informative): T-ADS request handling in the HSS

E.1 T-ADS request handling in the HSSThe following figure shows a
possible detailed handling of T-ADS Information request in the HSS:

When receiving a T-ADS request from an Application Server, the HSS
checks whether serving nodes (i.e. SGSN and/or MME) are registered (i.e.
GPRS services and/or EPS services are actually subscribed, serving node
addresses are stored and not marked as purged).

If neither MME nor SGSN is registered, a response indicating that IMS
voice over PS sessions is not supported is returned to the Application
Server. UE Activity Time and the Last RAT Type are not reported.

If both MME and SGSN are registered but the registered SGSN is a
Gn/Gp-SGSN, the HSS treats the MME as not registered in the following
T-ADS request handling.

Otherwise,

if in the previous ULR(s) the AVP
Homogeneous-Support-of-IMS-Voice-Over-PS-Sessions was received from all
the registered serving nodes with the same value (either with SUPPORTED
or NOT\_SUPPORTED), a response with the received value is returned to
the Application Server. UE Activity Time and the Last RAT Type are not
reported.

if in previous ULRs the AVP
Homogeneous-Support-of-IMS-Voice-Over-PS-Sessions was received from all
the registered serving nodes but with different values, the HSS
continues processing as follows:

if MME or SGSN (or both) did not indicated support of T-ADS Data
Retrieval within the previous ULR, a response indicating
IMS-VOICE-OVER-PS-SUPPORT-UNKNOWN is returned to the Application Server.
UE Activity Time and the Last RAT Type are not reported.

otherwise the HSS retrieves T-ADS Data from MME and from SGSN. After
retrieval, the HSS returns a response to the Application Server
indicating the response from MME or SGSN whichever reported the most
recent UE Activity Time. UE Activity Time and the Last RAT Type are also
reported.

if in the previous ULR(s) the AVP
Homogeneous-Support-of-IMS-Voice-Over-PS-Sessions was not received from
at least one of the registered serving nodes, the HSS continues
processing as follows:

if at least one of the registered serving nodes that did not send an
Homogeneous-Support-of-IMS-Voice-Over-PS-Sessions AVP within the
previous ULR did not indicate support of T-ADS Data Retrieval within the
previous ULR, a response indicating IMS-VOICE-OVER-PS-SUPPORT-UNKNOWN is
returned to the Application Server. UE Activity Time and the Last RAT
Type are not reported.

otherwise the HSS retrieves T-ADS Data from all the registered serving
nodes that did not send an
Homogeneous-Support-of-IMS-Voice-Over-PS-Sessions AVP within the
previous ULR. When all responses are received the HSS continues
processing as follows:

if two T-ADS Data responses were receive (one from MME and one from
SGSN), the HSS returns a response to the Application Server indicating
the response from MME or SGSN whichever reported the most recent UE
Activity Time. UE Activity Time and the Last RAT Type are also reported.

if one T-ADS Data response was received (from MME or SGSN) and the other
serving node (SGSN or MME) was not registered, the HSS returns a
response to the Application Server indicating the response from
responding serving node. UE Activity Time and the Last RAT Type are also
reported.

if one T-ADS Data response was received (from MME or SGSN) and the other
serving node (SGSN or MME) has sent an
Homogeneous-Support-of-IMS-Voice-Over-PS-Sessions AVP within the
previous ULR, the HSS continues processing as follows:

if information about support / non-support of IMS voice over PS sessions
from both serving nodes are identical, the HSS returns this information
to the Application Server. UE Activity Time and the Last RAT Type are
not reported.

if information about support / non-support of IMS voice over PS sessions
from both serving nodes are not identical, the HSS continues processing
as follows:

if the serving node that sent an
Homogeneous-Support-of-IMS-Voice-Over-PS-Sessions AVP within the
previous ULR did not indicate support of T-ADS Data Retrieval within the
previous ULR, a response indicating IMS-VOICE-OVER-PS-SUPPORT-UNKNOWN is
returned to the Application Server. UE Activity Time and the Last RAT
Type are not reported.

otherwise the HSS retrieves T-ADS Data from the serving node that sent
an Homogeneous-Support-of-IMS-Voice-Over-PS-Sessions AVP within the
previous ULR. When the response is received, the HSS returns a response
to the Application Server indicating the response from MME or SGSN
whichever reported the most recent UE Activity Time. UE Activity Time
and the Last RAT Type are also reported.

########  Annex F (normative): Diameter overload control mechanism

F.1 General
-----------

Diameter overload control mechanism is an optional feature.

IETF RFC 7683 \[36\] specifies a Diameter overload control mechanism
which includes the definition and the transfer of related AVPs between
Diameter nodes.

It is recommended to make use of IETF RFC 7683 \[36\] on the Sh
interface where, when applied, the AS shall behave as a reacting node
and the HSS as a reporting node.

Depending on regional/national requirements and network operator policy,
priority traffic (e.g. MPS as described in 3GPP TS 22.153 \[38\]) shall
be exempted from throttling due to Diameter overload control up to the
point where requested traffic reduction cannot be achieved without
throttling the priority traffic.

F.2 HSS behaviour
-----------------

The HSS requests traffic reduction from the AS when the HSS is in an
overload situation, including OC-OLR AVP in answer commands as described
in IETF RFC 7683 \[36\].

The HSS identifies that it is in an overload situation by implementation
specific means. For example, the HSS may take into account the traffic
over the Sh interfaces or other interfaces, the level of usage of
internal resources (CPU, memory), the access to external resources, etc.

The HSS determines the specific contents of OC-OLR AVP in overload
reports and the HSS decides when to send OC-OLR AVPs by implementation
specific means.

F.3 AS behaviour
----------------

The AS applies required traffic reduction received in answer commands to
subsequent applicable requests, as per IETF RFC 7683 \[36\].

The AS achieves requested traffic reduction by implementation specific
means. For example, the AS may implement message throttling with
prioritization or a message retaining mechanism for operations that can
be postponed.

Diameter requests related to priority traffic (e.g. MPS) and emergency,
detected via the presence of priority information (e.g.,
Resource-Priority header field for MPS) in SIP messages as described in
3GPP TS 24.229 \[39\], have the highest priority. Depending on
regional/national regulatory and operator policies, these Diameter
requests shall be the last to be throttled, when the AS has to apply
traffic reduction. Relative priority amongst various priority traffic
(e.g. MPS) and emergency traffic is subject to regional/national
regulatory and operator policies.

########  Annex G (Informative): Diameter overload node behaviour

G.1 Message prioritization 
--------------------------

This clause describes possible behaviours of the AS regarding message
prioritization in an informative purpose.

The AS may take the following into account when making throttling
decisions:

\- Identification of the procedures that can be deferred (e.g.
Subscription to notification of Data Update), so to avoid to drop non
deferrable procedures;

\- Prioritization of certain types of request (e.g. between PUR and SNR)
according to the context of their use, in particular:

\- Higher prioritization of commands for AS that are related to a
registered user for a service, so to avoid the interruption of the
registered service for the user.

\- Lower prioritization of commands for AS that are related to massive
subscription data update due to provisioning.

\- Priority level of a priority user (e.g., MPS user).

######## Annex H (Informative): Data shared among multiple subscribers

H.1 General 
-----------

This clause applies only to Repository Data.

As defined by this specification, Repository Data is updated using a
Sh-Update procedure per subscriber and Service Indication. This means
that when Repository Data needs to be modified, it requires an update
operation per subscriber, even if the same Repository Data is also part
of other subscribers\' data set.

If Repository Data for a specific Service Indication is shared by a
large amount of subscribers, it implies a large amount of update
operations, which may trigger a large amount of notifications if any AS
subscribed to changes for these corresponding subscribers.

See 3GPP TS 29.364 \[40\] for a description of a solution to avoid this
massive amount of update operations. However, it is important to remark
that there may be other implementation specific solutions that handle
data sharing among multiple individual subscribers.

######## Annex I (normative): Diameter message priority mechanism

I.1 General
-----------

IETF draft-ietf-drmp-02 \[42\] specifies a Diameter message priority
mechanism that allows Diameter nodes to indicate the relative priority
of Diameter messages. With this information, other Diameter nodes may
leverage the relative priority of Diameter messages into routing,
resource allocation, set the DSCP marking for transport of the
associated Diameter message, and also abatement decisions when overload
control is applied.

I.2 Sh/Dh interface
-------------------

### I.2.1 General 

The Diameter message priority mechanism is an optional feature.

It is recommended to make use of IETF draft-ietf-drmp-02 \[42\] over the
Sh/Dh interface of an operator network when the overload control defined
in Annex F is applied on this Sh/Dh interface.

### I.2.2 AS/OSA SCS behaviour

When the AS/OSA SCS supports the Diameter message priority mechanism,
the AS/OSA SCS shall comply with IETF RFC 7944 \[42\].

The AS/OSA SCS sending a request shall determine the required priority
according to its policies. When priority is required, the AS/OSA SCS
shall include the DRMP AVP indicating the required priority level in the
request it sends, and shall prioritise the request according to priority
level received.

When the AS/OSA SCS receives the corresponding response, it shall
prioritise the received response according to the priority level
received within the DRMP AVP if present in the response, otherwise
according to the priority level of the corresponding request.

When the AS/OSA SCS receives a request, it shall handle the request
according to the received DRMP AVP priority level. For the response, it
may modify the priority level received in the DRMP AVP according to its
policies and shall handle the response according to the required
priority level. If the required priority level is different from the
priority level received in the request, it shall include the DRMP AVP in
the response.

If:

\- the AS/OSA SCS supports using the Diameter message priority mechanism
for DSCP marking purposes,

\- the transport network utilizes DSCP marking, and

\- message-dependant DSCP marking is possible for the protocol stack
transporting Diameter,

then the AS/OSA SCS shall set the DSCP marking for transport of the
request or response according to the required priority level.

Diameter requests related to priority traffic (e.g. MPS as identified by
the AS through SIP procedures, emergency) shall contain a DRMP AVP with
a high priority of which the level value is operator dependent.

When not-explicitly requested, the inclusion and priority value of the
DRMP AVP in Diameter messages are implementation specific.

### I.2.3 HSS/SLF behaviour

When the HSS/SLF supports the Diameter message priority mechanism, the
HSS/SLF shall comply with IETF RFC 7944 \[42\].

The HSS/SLF sending a request shall determine the required priority
according to its policies. When priority is required, the HSS/SLF shall
include the DRMP AVP indicating the required priority level in the
request it sends, and shall prioritise the request according to the
required priority level.

When the HSS/SLF receives the corresponding response, it shall
prioritise the received response according to the priority level
received within the DRMP AVP if present in the response, otherwise
according to the priority level of the corresponding request.

When the HSS/SLF receives a request, it shall handle the request
according to the received DRMP AVP priority level. For the response, it
may modify the priority level received in the DRMP AVP according to its
policies and shall handle the response according to the required
priority level. If the required priority level is different from the
priority level received in the request, it shall include the DRMP AVP in
the response.

If:

\- the HSS/SLF supports using the Diameter message priority mechanism
for DSCP marking purposes,

\- the transport network utilizes DSCP marking, and

\- message-dependant DSCP marking is possible for the protocol stack
transporting Diameter,

then the HSS/SLF shall set the DSCP marking for transport of the request
or response according to the required priority level.

When not-explicitly requested, the inclusion and priority value of the
DRMP AVP in Diameter messages are implementation specific.

### I.2.4 Interactions

If the HSS/SLF supporting the Diameter message priority mechanism
receives the request message containing both the Session-Priority AVP
and DRMP AVP, the HSS/SLF shall prioritize the request according to
priority level received within the DRMP AVP.

######## Annex J (normative): Diameter load control mechanism

J.1 General 
-----------

Diameter load control mechanism is an optional feature.

It is recommended to make use of IETF RFC 8583 \[43\] on the Sh
interface where, when applied, the AS shall behave as reacting nodes and
the HSS as a reporting node.

J.2 HSS behaviour
-----------------

The HSS may report its current load by including a Load AVP of type HOST
in answer commands as described in IETF RFC 8583 \[43\].

The HSS calculates its current load by implementation specific means.
For example, the HSS may take into account the traffic over the Sh
interface or other interfaces, the level of usage of internal resources
(e.g. CPU, memory), the access to external resources, etc.

The HSS determines when to send Load AVPs of type HOST by implementation
specific means.

J.3 AS behaviour
----------------

When performing next hop Diameter Agent selection for requests that are
routed based on realm, the AS may take into account load values from
Load AVPs of type PEER received from candidate next hop Diameter nodes,
as per IETF RFC 8583 \[43\].
