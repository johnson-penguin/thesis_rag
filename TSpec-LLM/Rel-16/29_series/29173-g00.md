Foreword
========

This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

1 Scope
=======

The present document describes the Diameter-based SLh interface between
the GMLC and the HSS defined for the Control Plane LCS in EPC.

LCS procedures over the SLh interface are defined in the 3GPP TS 23.271
\[2\].

This specification defines the Diameter application for the GMLC-HSS,
SLh reference point. The interactions between the HSS and the GMLC are
specified, including the signalling flows. As LCS procedures over the
Diameter-based SLh interface are identical to the MAP-based Lh
interface, the descriptions of the Lh MAP operations defined in the 3GPP
TS 29.002 \[3\] are mapped into the descriptions of the SLh Diameter
commands.

2 References

this text, constitute provisions of the present document.

\- References are either specific (identified by date of publication,
edition number, version number, etc.) or non‑specific.

\- For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.

\- For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the case
of a reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), a
non-specific reference implicitly refers to the latest version of that

4 General Description
=====================

4.1 Introduction
----------------

The SLh reference point between the GMLC and the HSS is defined in the
3GPP TS 23.271 \[2\].

This document describes the Diameter-based SLh interface related
procedures, message parameters and protocol specifications.

4.2 Architecture Overview
-------------------------

The architecture for support of Location Services in GSM, UMTS and EPS
has been defined in 3GPP TS 23.271 \[2\] and the relevant network
elements and interfaces are shown in the figure 4.2-1.

Figure 4.2-1: Overview of the LCS Functional Architecture

In this architecture, the SLh interface is defined between the Gateway
Mobile Location Center (GMLC) and the Home Subscriber Server (HSS) to
allow the GMLC to request routing information from the HLR or HSS.

4.3 Functional Requirements of SLh Interface
--------------------------------------------

The requirements for SLh interface are defined in 3GPP TS 23.271 \[2\].

The SLh interface is used by the GMLC to request routing information
from the HSS i.e. the address of the H-GMLC, and/or the address of the
visited MSC/MSC server, SGSN, 3GPP AAA server or MME for a particular
target UE whose location has been requested.

5 Diameter-based SLh Interface
==============================

5.1 Introduction
----------------

This section describes the Diameter-based SLh interface related
procedures and Information elements exchanged between functional
entities.

In the tables that describe the Information Elements transported by each
Diameter command, each Information Element is marked as (M) Mandatory,
(C) Conditional or (O) Optional in the \"Cat.\" column. For the correct
handling of the Information Element according to the category type, see
the description detailed in section 6 of the 3GPP TS 29.228 \[4\].

5.2 Procedure Descriptions
--------------------------

### 5.2.1 Send Routing Information for LCS

#### 5.2.1.1 General

This procedure is used between the GMLC and the HSS. The procedure is
invoked by the GMLC and is used:

\- To retrieve routing information for LCS for a specified user from the
HSS.

This procedure is mapped to the commands LCS-Routing-Info-Request/Answer
in the Diameter application specified in chapter 6. Tables 5.2.1.1/1 and
5.2.1.1/2 detail the involved information elements.

#### 5.2.1.2 Detailed Behaviour of the HSS

Upon reception of the Send Routing Info for LCS request, the HSS shall,
in the following order:

1\. Check whether the requesting GMLC belongs to a network authorized to
request UE location information. If not, Experimental-Result shall be
set to DIAMETER\_ERROR\_UNAUTHORIZED\_REQUESTING\_NETWORK in the Send
Routing Information for LCS Response.

2\. Check that the User Identity for whom data is asked exists in HSS.
If not, Experimental-Result shall be set to
DIAMETER\_ERROR\_USER\_UNKNOWN in the Send Routing Information for LCS
Response.

2a. If both IMSI and MSISDN are present in the request, check whether
they identify the same User. If not, the HSS Result-Code shall be set to
DIAMETER\_CONTRADICTING\_AVPS in the Send Routing Information for LCS
Response.

3\. Check that there is at least one serving node associated with the
targeted user. If not, Experimental-Result shall be set to
DIAMETER\_ERROR\_ABSENT\_USER in the Send Routing Information for LCS
Response.

If there is an error in any of the above steps then the HSS shall stop
processing and shall return the error code specified in the respective
step (see 3GPP TS 29.329 \[9\] and 3GPP TS 29.229 \[8\] for an
explanation of the error codes).

If the HSS cannot fulfil the received request for reasons not stated in
the above steps, e.g. due to a database error or empty mandatory data
elements, it shall stop processing the request and set Result-Code to
DIAMETER\_UNABLE\_TO\_COMPLY.

Otherwise, the requested operation shall take place and the HSS shall
return the Result-Code AVP set to DIAMETER\_SUCCESS. The HSS returns one
or several of the network addresses of the current MME, SGSN, 3GPP AAA
server and/or VMSC/MSC server, the LCS capabilities of the serving nodes
if available, the V-GMLC address associated with the serving nodes, if
available, and whichever of the IMSI and MSISDN that was not provided in
the Send Routing Info for LCS request. If MSISDN was not provided in the
Send Routing Info for LCS request and the subscription is MSISDN-less,
the HSS shall return the dummy MSISDN value (see 3GPP TS 23.003 \[10\]).
If both MSISDN and IMSI were provided in the Send Routing Info for LCS
request, the HSS returns either MSISDN or IMSI or both. The HSS returns
the address of the H-GMLC. The HSS also provides the address of the PPR,
if available.

The HSS shall include the Diameter Identity of the SGSN (i.e. SGSN-Name
and SGSN-Realm), within the Serving-Node AVP or within an
Additional-Serving-Node AVP, if and only if the HSS has received an
indication that the Lgd interface is supported by the SGSN (see 3GPP TS
29.272 \[12\]).

The HSS shall include the SGSN Number, within the Serving-Node AVP or
Additional Serving-Node AVP, except if the HSS has received an
indication that the Lg interface is not supported by the SGSN (see 3GPP
TS 29.272 \[12\]).

If the UE is served by the MME and SGSN parts of the same combined
MME/SGSN (see 3GPP TS 29.272 \[12\] subclause 5.2.2.1.1 for how the HSS
determines if the UE is served by the combined MME/SGSN) and if this
combined MME/SGSN has indicated the support for optimized LCS procedure
(via the Supported-Feature AVP as defined in 3GPP TS 29.272 \[12\]
subclause 7.3.10) and if HSS supports this optimized LCS procedure, then
the HSS shall set the
\"Combined-MME/SGSN-Supporting-Optimized-LCS-Proc\" bit of the
RIA-Flags.

Regarding the LCS capabilities of the serving nodes, if the HSS
registered an SGSN via the S6d reference point (i.e., the registered
serving node is an S4-SGSN), the HSS shall set the LCS-Capabilities-Set
value to indicate support of Capability Set 5 (i.e., LCS release 7 or
later version). If the HSS registered an MME, the HSS shall not indicate
any LCS capability value to the GMLC (i.e., the LCS-Capabilities-Set AVP
shall be absent over SLh when the serving node is an MME); in this case,
the GMLC shall assume that the MME supports LCS Capability Set 5.

#### 5.2.1.3 Detailed Behaviour of the GLMC

If there are a serving node as well as additional serving nodes in a
successful Send Routing Info for LCS response, the receiving shall use
the serving node in preference to the additional serving nodes.

6 Protocol Specification and Implementations
============================================

6.1 Introduction
----------------

### 6.1.1 Use of Diameter Base Protocol

The Diameter base protocol as specified in IETF RFC 6733 \[17\] shall
apply except as modified by the defined support of the methods and the
defined support of the commands and AVPs, result and error codes as
specified in this specification. Unless otherwise specified, the
procedures (including error handling and unrecognised information
handling) shall be used unmodified.

### 6.1.2 Securing Diameter Messages

For secure transport of Diameter messages, see 3GPP TS 33.210 \[6\].

### 6.1.3 Accounting Functionality

Accounting functionality (Accounting Session State Machine, related
command codes and AVPs) shall not be used on the SLh interface.

### 6.1.4 Use of Sessions

Between the GMLC and the HSS, Diameter sessions shall be implicitly
terminated. An implicitly terminated session is one for which the server
does not maintain state information. The client shall not send any
re-authorization or session termination requests to the server.

The Diameter base protocol as specified in IETF RFC 6733 \[17\] includes
the Auth-Session-State AVP as the mechanism for the implementation of
implicitly terminated sessions.

The client (server) shall include in its requests (responses) the
Auth-Session-State AVP set to the value NO\_STATE\_MAINTAINED (1), as
described in IETF RFC 6733 \[17\]. As a consequence, the server shall
not maintain any state information about this session and the client
shall not send any session termination request. Neither the
Authorization-Lifetime AVP nor the Session-Timeout AVP shall be present
in requests or responses.

### 6.1.5 Transport Protocol

Diameter messages over the SLh interface shall make use of SCTP IETF RFC
4960 \[7\] as transport protocol.

### 6.1.6 Routing Considerations 

This clause specifies the use of the Diameter routing AVPs
Destination-Realm and Destination-Host.

If GMLC knows the address/name of the HSS for a certain user, both the
Destination-Realm AVP and the Destination-Host AVP shall be present in
the request. Otherwise, only the Destination-Realm AVP shall be present
and the command shall be routed to the next Diameter node. Consequently,
the Destination-Host AVP is declared as optional in the ABNF for all
requests initiated by a GMLC.

Destination-Realm AVP is declared as mandatory in the ABNF for all
requests.

If the Vendor-Specific-Application-ID AVP is received in any of the
commands defined in this specification, it shall be ignored by the
receiving node, and it shall not be used for routing purposes.

### 6.1.7 Advertising Application Support

The HSS and GMLC shall advertise support of the Diameter SLh Application
by including the value of the application identifier in the
Auth-Application-Id AVP within the Vendor-Specific-Application-Id
grouped AVP of the Capabilities-Exchange-Request and
Capabilities-Exchange-Answer commands.

The vendor identifier value of 3GPP (10415) shall be included in the
Supported-Vendor-Id AVP of the Capabilities-Exchange-Request and
Capabilities-Exchange-Answer commands, and in the Vendor-Id AVP within
the Vendor-Specific-Application-Id grouped AVP of the
Capabilities-Exchange-Request and Capabilities-Exchange-Answer commands.

The Vendor-Id AVP included in Capabilities-Exchange-Request and
Capabilities-Exchange-Answer commands that is not included in the
Vendor-Specific-Application-Id AVPs as described above shall indicate
the manufacturer of the Diameter node as per IETF RFC 6733 \[17\].

### 6.1.8 Diameter Application Identifier

The SLh interface protocol shall be defined as an IETF vendor specific
Diameter application, where the vendor is 3GPP. The vendor identifier
assigned by IANA to 3GPP
(http://www.iana.org/assignments/enterprise-numbers) is 10415.

The Diameter application identifier assigned to the SLh interface
application is 16777291 (allocated by IANA).

### 6.1.9 User Identity to HSS resolution

The User identity to HSS resolution mechanism enables the GMLC (for
non-roaming case) or Diameter Relay/proxy agents in the home network
(for roaming case) to find the identity of the HSS that holds the LCS
subscription data and routing information for the target user when
multiple and separately addressable HSSs have been deployed in the home
network. The resolution mechanism is not required in networks that
utilise a single HSS.

This User identity to HSS resolution mechanism may rely on routing
capabilities provided by Diameter and be implemented in the home
operator network within dedicated Diameter Agents (Redirect Agents or
Proxy Agents) responsible for determining the HSS identity based on the
provided user identity. If this Diameter based implementation is
selected by the Home network operator, the principles described in the
3GPP TS 29.272 \[12\] shall apply.

NOTE: Alternatives to the user identity to HSS resolution Diameter based
implementation are outside the scope of this specification.

6.2 Commands
------------

### 6.2.1 Introduction

This section defines the Command code values and related ABNF for each
command described in this specification.

### 6.2.2 Command-Code values

This section defines Command-Code values for the SLh interface
application as allocated by IANA.

Every command is defined by means of the ABNF syntax IETF RFC 2234
\[13\], according to the Command Code Format (CCF) specification defined
in IETF RFC 6733 \[17\]. In the case, the definition and use of an AVP
is not specified in this document, the guidelines in
IETF RFC 6733 \[17\] shall apply.

The Vendor-Specific-Application-Id AVP shall not be included in any
command sent by Diameter nodes supporting applications defined in this
specification. If the Vendor-Specific-Application-Id AVP is received in
any of the commands defined in this specification, it shall be ignored
by the receiving node.

NOTE: The Vendor-Specific-Application-Id AVP is included as an optional
AVP in all Command Code Format specifications defined in this
specification in order to overcome potential interoperability issues
with intermediate Diameter agents non-compliant with
IETF RFC 6733 \[17\].

The following Command Codes are defined in this specification:

6.3 Result-Code AVP and Experimental-Result AVP Values
------------------------------------------------------

### 6.3.1 General

This section defines result code values that shall be supported by all
Diameter implementations that conform to this specification.

### 6.3.2 Success

Result codes that fall within the Success category shall be used to
inform a peer that a request has been successfully completed. The
Result-Code AVP values defined in the Diameter base protocol specified
in IETF RFC 6733 \[17\] shall be applied.

### 6.3.3 Permanent Failures

Errors that fall within the Permanent Failures category shall be used to
inform the peer that the request has failed, and should not be attempted
again. The Result-Code AVP values defined in the Diameter base protocol
specified in IETF RFC 6733 \[17\] shall be applied. When one of the
result codes defined here is included in a response, it shall be inside
an Experimental-Result AVP and the Result-Code AVP shall be absent.

#### 6.3.3.1 DIAMETER\_ERROR\_USER\_UNKNOWN (5001)

This result code shall be sent by the HSS to indicate that the user
identified by the IMSI or the MSISDN is unknown. This error code is
defined in 3GPP TS 29.229 \[8\]

#### 6.3.3.2 DIAMETER\_ERROR\_UNAUTHORIZED\_REQUESTING\_NETWORK (5490)

This result code shall be sent by the HSS to indicate that the
requesting GMLC\'s network is not authorized to request UE location
information.

### 6.3.4 Transient Failures

Errors that fall within the transient failures category are those used
to inform a peer that the request could not be satisfied at the time
that it was received. The request may be able to be satisfied in the
future.

#### 6.3.4.1 DIAMETER\_ERROR\_ABSENT\_USER (4201)

This result code shall be sent by the HSS to indicate that the location
of the targeted user is not known at this time to satisfy the requested
operation.

6.4 AVPs
--------

### 6.4.1 General

The following table specifies the Diameter AVPs defined for the SLh
interface protocol, their AVP Code values, types, possible flag values
and whether or not the AVP may be encrypted. The Vendor-ID header of all
AVPs defined in this specification shall be set to 3GPP (10415).

For all AVPs which contain bit masks and are of the type Unsigned32, bit
0 shall be the least significant bit. For example, to get the value of
bit 0, a bit mask of 0x00000001 should be used.
