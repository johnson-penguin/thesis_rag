Foreword
========

This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

1 Scope
=======

The present document specifies the mapping:

\- performed by the AMF between HTTP responses (Status Codes and
Protocol or Application Errors) returned by 5GC NFs to the AMF and 5GMM
Cause values sent to UEs;

\- performed by the SMF between HTTP responses (Status Codes and
Protocol or Application Errors) returned by 5GC NFs to SMF and 5GSM
Cause values sent to UEs;

\- performed by the SMF between N4 errors returned by the UPF and 5GSM
Cause values sent to UEs.

this text, constitute provisions of the present document.

\- References are either specific (identified by date of publication,
edition number, version number, etc.) or non‑specific.

Nsmsf\_SMService\_UplinkSMS operations described in
3GPP TS 29.540 \[10\].

\- the Npcf\_AMPolicyControl service operations described in
3GPP TS 29.507 \[12\].

\- the Npcf\_UEPolicyControl service operations described in
3GPP TS 29.525 \[13\].

4.2 Mapping between Nausf services causes and 5GMM causes
---------------------------------------------------------

### 4.2.1 General

  ------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -------------------------

4.3 Mapping between Nsmf services causes and 5GMM causes
--------------------------------------------------------

### 4.3.1 General

This clause defines the mapping performed by the AMF between HTTP
responses (status codes and Protocol or Application Errors) returned by
SMF services to the AMF and the 5GMM cause values sent to UEs.

The AMF may invoke SMF service operations upon receipt of:

> \- 5GSM messages (e.g. PDU Session establishment request) piggybacked
> in 5GMM UL NAS TRANSPORT message;
>
> \- 5GMM Service Request or Registration Request messages, to establish
> the user-plane resources of a PDU session.

A 5GMM cause is defined in:

> \- the DL NAS TRANSPORT message;
>
> \- the PDU session reactivation result error cause IE of a
> REGISTRATION ACCEPT or SERVICE ACCEPT message;
>
> \- the REGISTRATION REJECT or SERVICE REJECT message.

The AMF shall support mapping the status code and/or Protocol or
Application Error received from the SMF to a 5GMM cause code, where
3GPP TS 24.501 \[3\] requires a 5GMM Cause to be included in the 5GMM
message sent to the UE.

> NOTE: REGISTRATION REJECT and SERVICE REJECT messages are rejected
> only due to 5GMM-specific reasons, i.e. not for problems specific to
> session management.

### 4.3.2 Mapping between Nsmf\_PDUSession service causes on N11 and 5GMM causes

#### 4.3.2.1 General

This clause defines the mapping for the Nsmf\_PDUSession service (see
3GPP TS 29.502 \[8\]).

-----------

This clause describes the mapping performed by the SMF between HTTP
responses (status Code and Protocol or Application Errors) returned by
NF services contacted by the SMF and the corresponding 5GSM cause values

the SMF includes the 5GSM cause in 5GSM messages sent in N1 SM
Information (see 3GPP TS 29.502 \[5\]).

No mapping is required for the Nsmf\_PDUSession service over N16 since
the 5GSM cause is generated at the H-SMF and provided to the V-SMF in N1
SM Information (see 3GPP TS 29.502 \[9\]).

No mapping is required for the Nsmf\_EventExposure service specified in
3GPP TS 29.508 \[9\]

5.4 Mapping between N4 causes and 5GSM causes

### 5.4.1 General

N4 error handling and cause codes are defined in 3GPP TS 29.244 \[2\].

The receipt of an N4 error may trigger error handling in SMF. This
clause defines the mapping performed by the SMF between when an error
received on N4 interface cannot be resolved by SMF and results in the
SMF sending a 5GSM message to the UE.
