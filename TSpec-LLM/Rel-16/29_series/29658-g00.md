This Technical Specification (TS) was been produced by ETSI Technical
Committee Telecommunications and Internet converged Services and
Protocols for Advanced Networking (TISPAN) and originally published as
ETSI TS 183 058 \[7\]. It was transferred to the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP) in January 2008.

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.

1 Scope
=======

The present document specifies the Stage 3 of the real-time transfer of
Tariff Information between a Charge Determination Point (CDP) and a
Charge Generation Point (CGP) by means of the Session Initiation
Protocol (SIP).

It identifies the protocol procedures and switching functions needed to
support the transfer of tariff information related to IP multimedia
services. The information needed to support the ISDN User part (ISUP)
signalling aspects of charging (ES 201 296 \[6\]) for Advice of Charge
information purposes is also specified, however, it can be used for
other purposes as well where applicable.

The present document is applicable to an environment where different
operators are working together. It is also applicable to a single
network operator environment.

Whether the present document is applicable to a national environment
and/or can be used for inter-network purposes depends on regulatory
demands and/or bilateral agreements. It should be noted that there are
network requirements and signalling limitations that are not covered
because they are outside the scope of the present document. Examples of
these are as follows:

\- the on-line provided advice of charge information may not accurately
reflect the correct charging rate due to discount rates, special
charging arrangements, etc. It is out of scope to ensure alignment of
this information;

\- complaint handling between network operators in case of incorrect
advice of charge information;

\- explicit encryption or special security mechanisms;

\- usage of the transferred tariff information for charging purposes;

\- interaction between UE and CGP for possible confirmation of provided
tariffs;

\- any function behind the CGP towards the UE.

information to the appropriate SIP requests or responses

NOTE: Example of a CDP is a SIP AS at the visited IMS network providing
the premium rate service.

**Charge Generation Point (CGP):** receives the tariff/add-on charge
information that was added by a CDP and transferred in the appropriate
SIP requests or responses

NOTE: Example of a CGP is an originating SIP AS at the home IMS network
for advice of charge purposes.

**charge unit:** base element for the charging process, expressed in
non-monetary or monetary units

**charging:** function within the telecommunications network and the
associated OCS/BD components whereby information related to a chargeable
event is collected, formatted, transferred and evaluated in order to

4 SIP Transfer of Charging Information
======================================

4.1 Description
---------------

### 4.1.1 General description

The present document specifies the procedures for the realtime transfer
of charging information in SIP between a Charge Determination Point
(CDP) and a Charge Generation Point (CGP). CDP is a network function
that determines which tariff/add-on charge should be applied and inserts
the charging information to the appropriate SIP requests or responses,
whereas the CGP is a network function that receives the tariff/add-on
charge information that was added by a CDP.

Example of CDP is a SIP AS at the visited IMS network providing the
premium rate service. Example of the CGP is the originating SIP AS at
the home IMS network for advice of charge purposes.

The functionality is needed to support the tariff/add-on charge
information of value added services that are charged by the operator of
the originating end user, the home IMS operator, in case the operator of
the originating end user has no knowledge about the tariff/add-on charge
information related to these value-added services.

A charge determination and charge generation point of the communication
may be located within the network of one operator (single network
operator environment) or may be located in different networks of
different operators (multi‑operator environment).

The configuration of several charge determination points for one
communication is possible. It is assumed that there is only one CGP for
the communication.

The transferred tariff/add-on charge information represents direct
Tariff Information (no pointers to charge data), either in monetary
(e.g. currency) units or non-monetary (e.g. meter‑pulse) units.

The following functionality is provided:

> i\) apply a communication attempt charge for unsuccessful
> communications;
>
> ii\) apply a communication setup charge (once) at start of charging;

\(iii\) apply an initial communication tariff at start of charging and
an (optional) next tariff at an absolute time during the communication;

> iv\) change immediately the current tariff;
>
> v\) apply immediately an add-on charge (either a number of
> non-monetary units or an amount of monetary units) during the
> communication. This add-on charge is additive and does not change the
> tariff in force;
>
> vi\) differentiation as to whether the tariff/add-on charge
> information is to be used for advice of charge purposes only, or for
> subscriber charging purposes (which would also allow it to be used for
> advice of charge purposes);
>
> vii\) perform validation (e.g. check range of parameters, check
> whether a request from a certain network operator can be accepted);
>
> viii\) apply a \"one time charge\" (i.e. non-periodic charge/flat
> rate) as a minimum communication charge at start of charging;

### 4.1.2 Network provider option

Not applicable.

4.2 Coding requirements
-----------------------

CDP and CGP shall support the INFO method according to RFC 2976 \[2\] in
support of SIP Transfer of Tariff Information.

CDP and CGP shall support multipart MIME content.

The SIP Transfer of Tariff Information XML schema, version 1.0, is
defined in annex C. The Tariff Information XML schema shall be
transported as a SIP MIME body. The MIME type for the Tariff Information
is \"application/vnd.etsi.sci+xml\" (in accordance with subclause 5.1).
Any SIP message that transports a body with Tariff Information shall
identify the payload as MIME type \"application/vnd.etsi.sci+xml\" (in
accordance with subclause 5.1).

4.3 Functional requirements
---------------------------

### 4.3.1 Overall requirements

a\) CGP receives tariff information and shall not send it further,
however, the received tariff information can be used for the AoC info
provision to the UE.

b\) There is only one CGP per service usage and the CGP is always
located within the home network of the served subscriber.

c\) CDP determines the tariff to be applied or an add on charge, and
provides for transfer to the CGP.

d\) There can be one or more CDP per service usage. CDP may be located
in the originating or in the terminating network.

e\) Sending of next Tariff Information.

A determination point shall not send next Tariff Information with a
switch-over time that is more than 23 h and 45 min after the current
time.

f\) Format of the Tariff Information.

All information issued for the same communication has to be in the same
format, i.e. monetary or non-monetary. This needs bilateral agreements
between the network operators concerned.

If non-monetary formats are used, the corresponding monetary value of a
non-monetary unit needs bilateral agreements between the network
operators concerned.

A CDP has to encode the Tariff Information in a format that can be
validated by the receiving CGP.

### 4.3.2 Procedures at a Charge Determination Point

#### 4.3.2.0 General

The CDP shall assume that the UE supports version 1.0 of the MIME type
associated with Tariff Information (see subclause 5.1), if support for
the MIME type associated with Tariff Information in the Accept header is
not indicated. If both the \"sv\" and \"schemaversion\" parameters are
present, then the CDP shall ignore the value of the \"schemaversion\"
parameter.

If the CDP includes the SIP Transfer of Tariff Information XML body (see
subclause 5.1), it shall set the Content-Type header field to MIME type
associated with Tariff Information (see subclause 5.1) and shall include
in its \"sv\" or \"schemaversion\" parameter\'s value the versions of
SIP Transfer of Tariff Information XML schema that can be used to
validate the SIP Transfer of Tariff Information XML body.

#### 4.3.2.1 Procedures during communication set-up

##### 4.3.2.1.1 Tariff indication

When a Charge Determination Point has determined that:

\- the tariff which has to be activated immediately at start of
charging; and/or

\- the next tariff which has to be activated at an absolute switch-over
time; and/or

\- the absolute switch-over time (GMT),

has to be transmitted to the charge generation point, the application
process shall issue the Tariff indication.

A Tariff indication may be re-issued during communication set-up phase
(i.e. at any time up to the dialog confirmation), replacing previously
issued information.

If the tariff is time dependent, then the next tariff and the absolute
time at which the current tariff has to be replaced by this next tariff
shall be sent. It can be sent together with the current tariff in the
initial Tariff indication. The next tariff and the tariff switch-over
time shall always be sent together.

The current tariff and the next tariff have the same tariff parameter
structure, i.e. a Communication Attempt charge, a Communication Setup
charge and a Communication charge (up to a maximum of 4 communication
subtariffs).

The tariff format used for the communication is indicated by the first
Tariff indication and shall not be changed during the communication.

The following clauses specify the procedures for some specific cases.

##### 4.3.2.1.2 Communication attempt charge

The communication attempt charge is a direct charge, to be charged only
for unsuccessful communications.

If a communication attempt charge is relevant to the communication, the
communication attempt Tariff Information shall be included in the Tariff
indication.

To cover the scenario in the generation point where the received
absolute switch-over time has already been reached at the receipt of the
Tariff indication or just before start of charging, the communication
attempt charge shall also be sent in the first Next Tariff parameter.

In case of monetary-format, the charge amount is indicated by a currency
factor multiplied by a currency scale.

In case of non-monetary format, the charge amount is indicated by a
number of meter-pulse units.

##### 4.3.2.1.3 Communication set-up charge

The communication setup charge is a direct charge, to be charged once at
start of charging.

If communication setup charge is relevant to the communication, the
communication setup Tariff Information shall be included in the first
Tariff indication.

To cover the scenario in the generation point where the received
absolute switch-over time has already been reached at the receipt of the
Tariff indication or just before start of charging, the communication
setup charge shall also be sent in the first Next Tariff parameter.

In the case of monetary-format, the charge amount is indicated by a
currency factor multiplied with a currency scale.

In the case of non-monetary-format the charge amount is indicated by a
number of meter-pulse units.

##### 4.3.2.1.4 Communication charge

The communication charge is a direct charge, to be applied at start of
charging.

If communication charge is relevant, this information shall be included
in the first Tariff indication and before start of charging.

a\) Non-monetary-format.

In case of non-monetary-format, the charge amount is indicated by a
number of meter-pulse units to be applied per time unit. The
Communication charge is free when its value is zero.

b\) Monetary-format.

In case of monetary-format, the charge amount per time unit is indicated
by a currency factor multiplied by a currency scale. The communication
charging is free of charge when the product is zero.

NOTE: With the currency-format only one fixed time unit is used. This
fixed time unit is one second, according to RFC 4006 \[3\].

c\) Communication charge sequence.

The communication charge may be a sequence of up to 4 communication
subtariffs. Except for the last subtariff, each subtariff shall be
limited by its tariff duration. The last (or single) subtariff of the
sequence may be either unlimited (tariff duration = 0) or limited.

At expiry of the tariff duration timer of the last (single)
communication subtariff of the communication charge sequence, the
following options are possible:

\- the communication charge sequence is re-applied; or

\- the communication charge sequence is not re-applied.

The chosen option is indicated in the tariffControlIndicators.

If a communication charge sequence is relevant to the communication, the
complete sequence shall be provided.

d\) Absolute switch-over time.

The absolute switch-over time is the time at which the current tariff
has to be replaced by the next tariff.

The next tariff and the tariff switch-over time shall always be provided
together.

e\) Minimum Communication Charge at Start of Charging.

To apply a minimum communication charge in case of non-monetary format,
the first subtariff of the sequence is defined with N pulses, a duration
which corresponds to the required duration and a time interval equal to
zero.

To apply a minimum communication charge in case of monetary format, the
first subtariff is defined with N currency units and a duration which
corresponds to the required duration. A flag in
CommunicationChargeCurrency (subTariffControl) indicates whether the
tariff is a \"one time charge\" for the minimum communication charge or
not.

#### 4.3.2.2 Procedures after start of charging

The following clauses and clause 4.3.2.3 specify the procedures for some
specific cases.

##### 4.3.2.2.1 Change current tariff

The current tariff can be changed by issuing a Tariff indication with
the new current tariff.

##### 4.3.2.2.2 Add-on charge 

If a charge determination point determines that a certain amount of
charge has to be added, the application process issues an Add-on-charge
indication. The current tariff is not changed.

An Add-on-charge indication is allowed after start of charging only.

The charge is either in non-monetary format or in monetary format.

The add-on charge in non-monetary-format is a number of meter-pulse
units. The add-on charge in monetary format is indicated by the currency
factor multiplied by the currency scale.

#### 4.3.2.3 Subsequent Tariff indications

In addition to the first Tariff indication, the application process in a
determination point issues subsequent Tariff indication during the
communication in the following cases:

a\) The current tariff is changed. A Tariff indication with the new
current tariff t has to be issued immediately.

b\) The next tariff and its tariff switch-over time were not issued at
communication setup. This exceptional case occurs when the switch-over
time was more than 23 h and 45 min after the moment the communication is
set-up. A Tariff indication with the next tariff and the corresponding
switchover time has to be issued at least before the switchover time.

### 4.3.3 Procedures at the charge generation point

The following general rule applies: Currently stored information related
to one network operator is replaced by information related to this
operator received subsequently.

#### 4.3.3.0 General

The CGP shall include the Accept header field with

\- \"application/vnd.etsi.sci+xml\", the MIME type associated with
Tariff Information (see subclause 5.1), and indicate the versions of the
XML Schema for SIP Transfer of Tariff Information it supports; and

\- any other MIME type the CGP is willing and capable of accepting.

#### 4.3.3.1 Procedures during communication set-up

##### 4.3.3.1.1 Tariff indication

The receipt of the Tariff indication indicates:

\- the tariff which has to be activated immediately at start of
charging; or

\- the next tariff which has to be activated at an absolute switch-over
time; or

\- the absolute switch-over time.

A Tariff indication may be received more than once during communication
set-up phase (i.e. at any time up to the dialog confirmation), replacing
previously received information.

If the tariff is time dependent, then the next tariff and the absolute
time at which the current tariff has to be replaced by this next tariff
will be received. They can be received together with the current tariff
in the initial Tariff indication.

The current tariff and the next tariff have the same tariff parameter
structure, i.e. a communication attempt charge, a communication setup
charge and a communication charge (up to a maximum of 4 communication
subtariffs). The tariff parameters have either the non-monetary format
or the monetary format. The tariff-format used for the communication is
indicated by the first Tariff indication and shall not be changed during
the communication.

Validation shall be performed (e.g. check of range of parameters, check
of network identification).

The following clauses specify the procedures for some specific cases.

##### 4.3.3.1.2 Communication attempt charge

The communication attempt charge is a direct charge, to be charged only
for unsuccessful communications.

If a communication attempt charge is relevant to the communication, the
communication attempt charge information shall be included in the Tariff
indication.

In the case of monetary-format, the charge amount is indicated by a
currency factor multiplied by a currency scale. The communication
attempt charging shall not be performed if the product is zero or the
parameter is not present.

In the case of non-monetary-format, the charge amount is indicated by a
number of meter-pulse units. The communication attempt charging shall
not be performed if the value is zero or the parameter is not present.

##### 4.3.3.1.3 Communication setup charge

The communication setup charge is a direct charge, to be charged once at
start of charging.

If a communication setup charge is relevant to the communication, the
communication setup charge information is included in the first Tariff
indication.

In the case of monetary-format, the charge amount is indicated by a
currency factor multiplied with a currency scale. The communication
setup charging shall not be performed when the product is zero or the
parameter is not present.

In the case of non-monetary-format the charge amount is indicated by a
number of meter-pulse units. The communication setup charge shall not be
performed when the number is zero or the parameter is not present.

##### 4.3.3.1.4 Communication charge

The communication charge is a direct charge, to be applied at start of
charging.

As part of the Current Tariff, the Communication Tariff is applied
immediately at start of charging.

As part of the Next Tariff, the Communication Tariff is applied at the
absolute time indicated by the absolute switch‑over time parameter. The
switch procedure is a network matter.

If the absolute switch-over time given in the Tariff indication is
already passed, then the communication charge of the next tariff instead
of the current tariff shall immediately be applied (see also
clause 4.3.1 b).

a\) Non-monetary-format.

In case of non-monetary-format, the charge amount is indicated by a
number of meter-pulse units to be applied per time unit. The
communication is free of charge when its value is zero.

b\) Monetary-format.

In case of monetary-format, the charge amount per time unit is indicated
by a currency factor multiplied by a currency scale. The communication
is free of charge when the product is zero.

NOTE: With the currency-format only one fixed time unit is used. This
fixed time unit is one second, according to RFC 4006 \[3\].

c\) Communication charge sequence.

The communication charge may be a sequence of up to 4 communication
subtariffs. Except for the last subtariff, each subtariff shall be
limited by its tariff duration. The last (or single) subtariff of the
sent sequence may be either unlimited (tariff duration = 0) or limited.

Initially, charging shall use the first subtariff. At expiry of the
tariff duration timer, the subsequent subtariff shall be applied.

At expiry of the tariff duration timer of the last (single)
communication subtariff of the communication charge sequence, the
following options are possible:

\- the communication charge sequence is re-applied; or

\- the communication charge sequence is not re-applied.

The option to be applied is indicated in the tariffControlIndicators.

If a communication charge sequence is relevant to the communication, the
complete sequence shall be provided.

When the communication charge sequence is not re-applied, the following
network provider option exists: either the communication continues
\"free of charge\" or the communication is released.

d\) Absolute switch-over time.

The absolute switch-over time is the time at which the current tariff
has to be replaced by the next tariff. In a multi-operator environment,
the procedures of how the subtariffs of the next tariff are applied are
subject of bilateral or multilateral agreements.

e\) Minimum communication charge at start of charging.

To apply a minimum communication charge in case of pulse format, the
first subtariff of the sequence shall defined with N pulses, a duration
which corresponds to the required duration and a time interval equal to
zero.

To apply a minimum communication charge in case of currency format, the
first subtariff shall be defined with N currency units and a duration
which corresponds to the required duration. A flag in
CommunicationChargeCurrency (subTariffControl) indicates whether the
tariff is a \"one time charge\" for the minimum communication charge or
not.

#### 4.3.3.2 Procedures after start of charge

If the communication setup charge is applied, all following received
communication attempts and communication setup charges shall be ignored.

The following clauses and clause 4.3.2.4 specify the procedures for some
specific cases.

##### 4.3.3.2.1 Change current tariff

a\) On receipt of the Tariff indication with the new tariff, the current
tariff shall be changed

After successful validation (e.g. check of range of parameters, check of
network identification), the new current tariff shall immediately be
applied to the communication according to the following two tariff
change procedures:

\- tariff change without restart of the charging process (see b));

\- tariff change with restart of the charging process (see c)).

Which immediate tariff change procedure shall be used is indicated in
the ChargingContolIndicators by
\"immediateChangeOfActuallyAppliedTariff\": value 1 means \"with
restart\", value 0 means \"without restart\".

b\) Tariff Change without restart of the charging process.

The charging process for the actual communication shall be continued
with the new current tariff. I.e. the tariff change procedure is the
same as the one which is performed at a tariff switchover from the
current to the next tariff. This means that:

\- at the change of a tariff sequence, the new applied subtariff of the
new tariff sequence is retrieved via the elapsed communication duration;

\- at the change of a non-periodic tariff, the new non-periodic tariff
is not applied (no double counting);

\- the new communication attempt and communication setup charge are not
applied.

c\) Tariff Change with restart of the charging process.

The charging process with the actual current tariff shall be closed and
restarted with the new current tariff. This means that:

\- at the change of a tariff sequence, the charging process restarts
with the first communication subtariff of the new tariff sequence;

\- at the change of a non-periodic tariff, the new non-periodic tariff
is applied;

\- the new communication attempt and communication setup charge are not
applied.

d\) In a multi-operator environment, the procedures of how the
subtariffs of the next tariff are applied are subject of bilateral or
multilateral agreements.

##### 4.3.3.2.2 Add-on Charge

On receipt of the Add-on-charge indication, the given amount of charge
has to be added. The current tariff shall not be changed.

An Add-on-charge indication is allowed after start of charging only.

The charge is either in non-monetary format or in monetary format.

The add-on charge in non-monetary-format is a number of meter-pulse
units. The add-on charge in monetary format is indicated by the currency
factor multiplied by the currency scale.

#### 4.3.3.3 Subsequent Tariff indications

In addition to the first Tariff indication, subsequent Tariff
indications during the communication may be received in the following
cases:

a\) The current tariff has to be changed. A Tariff indication with the
new current tariff together with the next tariff and its switch-over
time will be received.

b\) The next tariff and its tariff switch-over time were not received at
communication setup. A Tariff indication with the next tariff and the
corresponding switchover time will be received before the switchover
time.

### 4.3.4 Handling of identifiers

The initial indication, i.e. either a Tariff indication or an
Add-on-charge indication, issued by the application process in a charge
determination point shall contain the originationIdentification A.

The initial acknowledgement (i.e. the first Tariff/Add-on-charge
response) to this initial (Tariff/Add-on-charge) indication (with
originationIdentification and without destinationIdentification) issued
by the application process in the generation point shall contain the
originationIdentification B and the destinationIdentification A in order
to allow mapping between the sending and receiving direction.

The destinationIdentification A equals the originationIdentification A,
and the destinationIdentification B equals the originationIdentification
B.

All subsequent Tariff and Add-on-charge indications associated with the
same tariff determination instance contain the originationIdentification
A and destinationIdentification B. All subsequent Tariff and
Add-on-charge responses associated with the same tariff determination
instance shall contain the originationIdentification B and
destinationIdentification A.

4.4 Signalling requirements
---------------------------

### 4.4.1 General

When sending Tariff Information, the CDP shall encode this information
according to the XML-schema defined in annex C and send it to the CGP.
In addition, for this MIME body the AS:

\- shall set the Content-Type header field to
\"application/vnd.etsi.sci+xml\" and set:

a\) the Content-Disposition header field to \"render\" with the
\"handling\" parameter set to \"optional\", or

b\) as an operator option, the Content-Disposition header field to
\"signal\" with the \"handling\" parameter set to \"required\" or
\"optional\".

In the case the Tariff Information is transported in a message that is
forwarded by CDP that contains already a content body, CDP shall
generate a multipart/mixed MIME body containing two sub-parts:

\- one with the Tariff Information; the Content-Type and
Content-Disposition of this sub-part should be coded as specified for
non-multipart bodies;

\- one with the received body; headers describing the content of the
received SIP message (e.g. Content-type) should be moved into the
headers of the this subpart.

### 4.4.2 Procedures during communication set-up

#### 4.4.2.1 Procedures at the CDP

When an INVITE request is received, the CDP operates as a routing B2B UA
as specified in clause 5.7.5 of\
3GPP TS 24.229 \[4\] and includes the tariff information in the content
body of a reliable 1xx provisional response, or in the content body of a
200 OK.

### 4.4.3 Procedures after start of charging

#### 4.4.3.1 Procedures at the CDP

The CDP operates as a routing B2B UA as specified in clause 5.7.5 of
3GPP TS 24.229 \[4\] and may send tariff information at any moment
during the active phase of the communication. When sending the tariff
information, the CDP shall include the tariff information in the content
body of a mid-dialog request, a mid-dialog response or in the content
body of a 200 OK response forwarded by the CDP or of an INFO request
generated by the CDP.

4.5 Interaction with other services
-----------------------------------

Not applicable.

4.6 Interactions with other networks
------------------------------------

### 4.6.1 Interaction with PSTN/ISDN

In case of interaction with networks which do not provide tariff
information in the signalling system, the tariff information shall be
discarded and the communication shall continue according to the basic
call procedures.

The elements and types of the SIP Transfer of Tariff Information XML
schema, version 1.0 (defined in annex C), shall be mapped to/from the
regarding elements and types of the Tariff Charging ASE defined in
clause 8 of ES 201 296 \[6\], as described in table 1. When the MGCF is
able to interwork the ISUP charging ASE to a XML instance, the MGCF
shall send to the ISDN network an ISUP charging acknowledgment
\"accepted\". Was the interworking not successful, the MGCF acts as
described in clause 6.3.6 of ES 201 296 \[6\] or no acknowledgement is
sent.

========================================

5.1 SIP Transfer of Tariff Information XML body
-----------------------------------------------

### 5.1.1 General

This subclause contains the SIP Transfer of Tariff Information XML body
in XML format. The SIP Transfer of Tariff Information XML shall be valid
against the SIP Transfer of Tariff Information XML schema defined in
Annex C.

See subclause 5.1.2 for the associated MIME type definition.

### 5.1.2 MIME type definition

#### 5.1.2.1 Introduction

This subclause defines the MIME type for
\"application/vnd.etsi.sci+xml\". A SIP Transfer of Tariff Information
XML Document can be identified with this media type.

#### 5.1.2.2 Syntax

The following optional parameters are defined:

\- \"charset\": the parameter has identical semantics to the charset
parameter of the \"application/xml\" media type as specified in
RFC 3023 \[9\].

\- \"sv\" or \"schemaversion\": the syntax for the \"sv\" or
\"schemaversion\" parameter is specified in table 2:

Table 2: Syntax of the \"sv\" or \"schemaversion\" parameter

m-parameter /= (\"sv\" / \"schemaversion\") EQUAL LDQUOT \[
sv-value-list \] RDQUOT

sv-value-list = sv-value-range \*( \",\" sv-value )

sv-value-range = sv-value \[ \"-\" sv-value \]

sv-value = number / token

number = 1\*DIGIT \[ \".\" 1\*DIGIT \]

The BNF for m-parameter is taken from IETF RFC 3261 \[8\] and modified
accordingly.

#### 5.1.2.3 Operation

The encoding considerations for \"application/vnd.etsi.sci+xml\" are
identical to those of \"application/xml\" as described in
RFC 3023 \[9\].

The \"sv\" or \"schemaversion\" parameter's value is used to indicate:

\- the versions of SIP Transfer of Tariff Information XML schema that
can be used to validate the SIP Transfer of Tariff Information XML body
(if the MIME type and parameter are present in the Content-Type header)
or

\- the accepted versions of the SIP Transfer of Tariff Information XML
body (if the MIME type and parameter are present in the Accept header).

If the \"sv\" and \"schemaversion\" parameter are absent, it shall be
assumed that version 1.0 of the XML Schema for the SIP Transfer of
Tariff Information XML body is supported.

######## Annex A (informative): Signalling flows

NOTE: The UNI AOC messages (to the left of the CGP) are out of scope of
the present document and are shown for explanation reasons.

Figure 1: Transfer of Tariff Information during communication set-up

Figure 1 gives an example for transfer of Tariff Information during the
communication set-up phase. When an INVITE request is received, the CDP
includes the Tariff Information in the content body of a reliable 1xx
provisional response, in this example the 183 Session progress response.
The Tariff Information includes the current tariff T1, the next tariff
T2, and the absolute switch-over time 10 h and 00 min.

The CGP applies T1 when the dialog is confirmed after the reception of
the 200 OK. At 10 h and 00 min the CGP switches to T2.

Figure 2: Transfer of Add-on-charge

Figure 2 gives an example for transfer of Add-on-charge after start of
charging. The CDP includes the Tariff Information in the content body of
an INFO request.

After the reception of the INFO request the CGP applies the Add-on
charge.

Figure 3: Immediate tariff change without restart of the charging
instance

Figure 3 gives an example for an immediate tariff change without a
restart of the charging instance. After start of charging, the CDP
includes the Tariff Information in the content body of an INFO request.
The Tariff Information includes the new current tariff T2, which is a
tariff sequence with the sub-tariffs T21 (duration 1 h) and T22
(duration unlimited), and the indication that no restart shall be
applied.

After the reception of the INFO request the CGP applies T22, because T22
is valid 1 h and 30 min after communication start.

Figure 4: Immediate tariff change with restart of the charging instance

Figure 4 gives an example for an immediate tariff change with a restart
of the charging instance. After start of charging, the CDP includes the
Tariff Information in the content body of an INFO request. The Tariff
Information includes the new current tariff T2, which is a tariff
sequence with the sub-tariffs T21 (duration 1 h) and T22 (duration
unlimited), and the indication that a restart shall be applied.

After the reception of the INFO request the CGP restarts the charging
instance and applies T21 for 1 h, and then switches to T22.

-   Call attempt charge pulse (optional), see clause B.3.2.11.2; and

-   Call setup charge pulse (optional), see clause B.3.2.11.3.

The communication charges are meter-pulse units, which are to be applied
per charge unit time interval. The call attempt pulse units are to be
charged only for unsuccessful calls. The call set-up pulse units are to
be charged once at start of charging.

#### B.3.2.11.1 Communication charge sequence pulse

The communication charge sequence pulse shall contain a sequence of 1 up
to 4 elements coded as communication charge pulse, see clause B.3.2.10.

#### B.3.2.11.2 Call attempt charge pulse

Call attempt charge pulse shall be coded as pulse units, see clause
B.3.2.4.

#### B.3.2.11.3 Call setup charge pulse

Call setup charge pulse shall be coded as pulse units, see clause
B.3.2.4.

### B.3.2.12 Tariff duration type

The duration indicates for how long time the communication charge
component is valid. Expiration of the tariff duration timer leads to the
activation of the next communication charge (if present). In the case
where there is no next communication charge in the communication charge
sequence, the action to be performed is indicated by the tariff control
indicators.

Tariff duration shall have a INTEGER values form 0 to 36 000.

Tariff duration identifies with 0 unlimited duration and else in seconds
unit.

0 = unlimited

1 = 1 s

2 = 2 s

\...

36 000 = 10 h

### B.3.2.13 Sub tariff control type

Sub tariff control shall contain 1 up to 8 one time charge elements. The
coding of the one time charge element is as follows:

0 - Periodic charge.

1 - One time charge.

### B.3.2.14 Charge unit time interval type

The charge unit time interval is binary coded and has the value range
from 0 to 35 997. It begins with 200 msec and then in steps of 50 msec.

The LSBit is the least significant bit of the first octet.

The MSBit is the most significant bit of the last octet.

The coding of the ChargeUnitTimeInterval is the following:

0 : no periodic metering

1 : 200 msec

2 : 250 msec

..

35 997 : 30 min

All other values are spare.

######## Annex D (informative): IANA registration templates

D.1 IANA registry for Application Media Types
---------------------------------------------

### D.1.1 IANA Registration template for application/vnd.etsi.sci+xml

NOTE 1: The information in the present Clause is for registration at
IANA. RFC 4288 \[10\], section 9, describes the process that applies in
case of changes to the registry of media types. Any future changes to
the XML schema in Annex C or to the present Annex D.1.1 would require
that this procedure is invoked.

NOTE 2: The MIME type \"application/vnd.etsi.sci+xml\" has originally
been registered at IANA based on ETSI TS 183 058 v2.0.0. The maintenance
responsibility for this specification has been transfered to 3GPP. Some
corrections to the syntax of the XML schema are only included in the
present specification, The original IANA registration is therefore
outdated.

**MIME media type name:**

application

**MIME subtype name:**

vnd.etsi.sci+xml

**Required parameters:**

None

**Optional parameters:**

\"charset\" the parameter has identical semantics to the charset
parameter of the \"application/xml\" media type as specified in
RFC 3023 \[9\].

\"sv\" or \"schemaversion\" the parameter\'s value is used to indicate:

\- the versions of the SIP Transfer of Tariff Information XML schema
that can be used to validate the SIP Transfer of Tariff Information XML
body (if the MIME type and parameter are present in the Content-Type
header field) or

\- the accepted versions of the SIP Transfer of Tariff Information XML
body (if the MIME type and parameter are present in the Accept header
field).

If the \"sv\" and \"schemaversion\" parameter are absent, it shall be
assumed that version 1.0 of the SIP Transfer of Tariff Information XML
body is supported.

**Encoding considerations:**

Same as encoding considerations of application/xml as specified in
RFC 3023 \[9\]

**Security considerations:**

Same as general security considerations for application/xml as specified
in section 10 of RFC 3023 \[9\].

In addition, this content type provides a format for exchanging
information in SIP, so the security considerations from RFC 3261 \[8\]
apply.

**Interoperability considerations:**

Same as Interoperability considerations as specified in section 3.1 of
RFC 3023 \[9\].

If both \"sv\" and \"schemaversion\" are specified, then the value of
\"schemaversion\" is ignored.

**Published specification:**

3GPP TS 29.658, version 8.4.0: \"SIP Transfer of IP Multimedia Service
Tariff Information; Protocol specification\"

Available via \<http://www.3gpp.org/specs/numbering.htm\>.

**Applications which use this media:**

Applications that use the 3GPP IP multimedia (IM) Core Network (CN)
subsystem as defined by 3GPP.

**Intended usage:**

COMMON

**Additional information :**

1\. **Magic number(s)** : none

2\. **File extension(s)** : none

3\. **Macintosh file type code** : none

4\. **Object Identifiers**: none
