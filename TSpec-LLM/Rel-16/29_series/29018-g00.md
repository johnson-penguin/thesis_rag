Foreword
========

This Technical Specification (TS) has been produced by the 3^rd^
Generation Partnership Project (3GPP).

The present document specifies procedures used between the Serving GPRS
Support Node (SGSN) and the Visitors Location Register (VLR) for
co-ordination between GSM circuit switched services and GSM packet data
services within the 3GPP system.

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

Introduction
============

The present document specifies or references the procedures to provide
co-ordination between the GSM circuit switched services controlled at
the Visitors Location Register (VLR) and the GSM packet switched
services controlled at the Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN). The
procedures specified in the present document are intended to optimise
the use of the resources when an MS supports both GSM circuit switched
services and GSM packet switched services.

1 Scope
=======

The present document specifies or references procedures used on the
Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) to Visitors Location Register (VLR)
interface for interoperability between GSM circuit switched services and
GSM packet data services.

The present document specifies the layer 3 messages and procedures on
the Gs interface to allow coordination between databases and to relay
certain messages related to GSM circuit switched services over the GPRS
subsystem.

The functional split between VLR and SGSN is defined in 3GPP TS
23.060 \[8\]. The required procedures between VLR and SGSN are defined
in detail in the present document.

2 References
============

The following documents contain provisions which, through reference in
this text, constitute provisions of the present document.

\- References are either specific (identified by date of publication,
edition number, version number, etc.) or non‑specific.

\- For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.

\- For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the case
of a reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), a
non-specific reference implicitly refers to the latest version of that
document *in the same Release as the present document*.

abbreviations given in 3GPP TR 21.905 \[1a\] and in 3GPP TS 23.060 \[8\]

4 Description of the association between a VLR and an SGSN
==========================================================

The Gs interface connects the databases in the MSC/VLR and the SGSN. The
procedures described in the present document are used to co-ordinate the
location information of MSs that are IMSI attached to both GPRS and
non-GPRS services. The Gs interface is also used to convey some circuit
switched related procedures via the SGSN.

The basis for the interworking between a VLR and an SGSN is the
existence of an association between those entities per MS. An
association consists of the SGSN storing the number of the VLR serving
the MS for circuit switched services and the VLR storing the number of
the SGSN serving the MS for packet switched services. The association is
only applicable to MSs in class-A mode of operation and MSs in class-B
mode of operation. The Gs association is not applicable if the
subscriber data indicates that the MS has subscription for packet only.
The Gs association is also not applicable if the MS requests only for
GPRS services and \"SMS-only service\" and SMS service is to be provided
by the SGSN based on conditions specified in 3GPP TS 23.060 \[8\].

All the messages described in the present document use the SCCP class 0
connectionless service.

When the return option in SCCP is used and the sender receives an
N\_NOTICE indication from SCCP, the sending entity shall report to the
Operation and Maintenance system (see ITU-T Recommendation
Q.714 \[64\]).

The behaviour of the VLR and the SGSN entities related to the Gs
interface are defined by the state of the association for an MS.
Individual states per association, i.e. per MS in class-A mode of
operation and MS in class-B mode of operation, are held at both the VLR
and the SGSN.

4.1 Association at the VLR
--------------------------

The states associated to the Gs interface in the VLR are specified in
this clause. The state diagram at the VLR is shown in figure 4.1. The
state diagram does not include the message error handling specified in
clause 16.

### 4.1.1 States at the VLR

Gs-NULL

There is no association with an SGSN for the MS and therefore the VLR
considers that the MS is IMSI detached for GPRS services. In this state
no BSSAP+-MS-INFORMATION-REQUEST or BSSAP+-MM-INFORMATION-REQUEST
messages are sent to the SGSN. The VLR may initiate paging on the Gs
interface if the \'Confirmed by Radio Contact\' restoration indicator in
the VLR is set to \'false\' (see 3GPP TS 23.007 \[6\]). Any message from
the SGSN is ignored apart from the BSSAP+-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST
message, the BSSAP+-GPRS-DETACH-INDICATION message and the
BSSAP+-IMSI-DETACH-INDICATION message.

LA-UPDATE PRESENT

The VLR has received a BSSAP+-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message from the
SGSN. In this state the VLR may be waiting for the outcome of the Update
Location procedure from the HLR. The VLR shall send
BSSAP+-PAGING-REQUEST messages to MSs in class-A and MSs in class-B mode
of operation via only the Gs interface.

Gs-ASSOCIATED

The VLR considers that the MS is attached to both GPRS and non-GPRS
services. In this state the VLR sends BSSAP+-PAGING-REQUEST messages to
MSs in class-A mode of operation and and MSs in class-B mode of
operation via only the Gs interface. The VLR can perform the MS
Identification procedure and the MM information procedure.

NOTE: Receipt of a BSSAP+-RESET-INDICATION message from the SGSN may
change or not the state of the Gs interface of all the associations
associated to the restarted SGSN, see subclause 12.3.

Figure 4.1/3GPP TS 29.018: State diagram at the VLR

4.2 Association at the SGSN
---------------------------

The states and MM context variables associated to the Gs interface in
the SGSN are specified in this clause. The state diagram at the SGSN is
shown in figure 4.2. The state diagram does not include the message
error handling specified in clause 16.

### 4.2.1 MM context variables at the SGSN

VLR-Reliable: Boolean

Set to \'false\' when the SGSN has received a reset indication from the
VLR.The SGSN may:

\- upon reception of a combined routing and location area update request
from an MS that is still attached for non-GPRS service, perform
immediately the location update for non-GPRS services procedure; or

\- upon reception of a periodic routing area update request from an MS
that is still attached for non-GPRS services, dependent on network
configuration and operator policy,

\- perform a network initiated detach with detach type \"IMSI detach\"
immediately after the completion of the periodic routing area update
procedure; or

\- perform immediately the location update for non-GPRS services
procedure.

EMM Combined UE Waiting Flag: Boolean

> Set to \'true\' when ISR is activated and:

\- the SGSN receives a Detach Notification indicating \"Local Detach\"
for an MS which supports EMM Combined procedures from the associated
MME; or

\- the SGSN receives the request from the Serving GW for deactivating
the last PDP context for an MS which supports EMM Combined procedures.

On the fifth expiry of timer T3322 described as T3322 time-out in
3GPP TS 24.008 \[11\], the EMM Combined UE Waiting Flag shall be
deactivated if it is activated.

SGSN-Reset: Boolean

> Set to \'true\' when the SGSN restarts after a failure. The
> \'SGSN-Reset\' variable is unique within an SGSN and it applies to all
> the MM context stored in the SGSN.

### 4.2.2 States at the SGSN

Gs-NULL

There is no association with a VLR for the MS and therefore the SGSN
considers that the MS is IMSI detached of non-GPRS services. In this
state the SGSN accepts BSSAP+-PAGING-REQUEST messages to MSs only if the
\'SGSN-Reset\' restoration indicator in the SGSN is set to \'true\'.

LA-UPDATE Requested

The SGSN has sent a BSSAP+-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message to the VLR.
In this state the SGSN waits for the outcome of the Location Update for
non-GPRS procedure at the VLR before sending the response to the MS. In
this state the SGSN accepts BSSAP+-PAGING-REQUEST messages.

Gs-ASSOCIATED

The SGSN stores an association for that MS. In this state the SGSN
performs the Location Update for non-GPRS services procedure towards the
VLR for MSs in class-A and MSs in class-B mode of operation, e.g. when
the MS moves to a new LA. All conditions describing when to trigger the
location update for non-GPRS services procedure are listed in
subclause 6.2.1.

Figure 4.2/3GPP TS 29.018: State diagram at the SGSN

### 4.2.3 State transitions in the SGSN without BSSAP+ signalling

During the routing area update procedure or tracking area update
procedure (see 3GPP TS 23.060 \[8\] and 3GPP TS 23.401\[8a\]) and if the
Gs association is not Gs-NULL, the SGSN may change the state of the Gs
association to Gs-NULL upon receipt of a SGSN Context Acknowledge
message (see 3GPP TS 29.060 \[26A\]) or Context Acknowledge message
without ISR activation (see 3GPP TS 29.274 \[28A\]) from the target
network.

During the inter-system handover from A/Gb mode or Iu mode to S1 mode,
or handover from A/Gb mode or Iu mode to A/Gb mode or Iu mode (see
3GPP TS 23.060 \[8\] and 3GPP TS 23.401\[8a\]) and if the Gs association
is not Gs-NULL, the SGSN may change the state of the Gs association to
Gs-NULL upon receipt of a Forward Relocation Complete (see
3GPP TS 29.060 \[26A\]) or Forward Relocation Complete Notification
message without ISR activation (see 3GPP TS 29.274 \[28A\]) from the
target network.

If the SGSN receives a normal attach request or a normal routing area
update request from the MS in state Gs-ASSOCIATED, the SGSN shall change
the state of the Gs association to Gs-NULL without explicit signalling
towards the VLR (see 3GPP TS 23.060 \[8\]).

5 Paging for non-GPRS services procedure
========================================

5.1 General description
-----------------------

This procedure is used by the VLR to send a BSSAP+-PAGING-REQUEST
message to an MS via the GPRS service. This procedure applies to MSs
that are simultaneously IMSI attached for GPRS services and non-GPRS
services. The procedure can be performed simultaneously with any other
procedure at the Gs interface.

5.2 Procedures in the VLR
-------------------------

The VLR shall handle the timers, queuing and retransmission for sending
the BSSAP+-PAGING-REQUEST message on the Gs interface in the same way
that it handles the sending of a PAGING message on the A or Iu-CS
interface.

### 5.2.1 Paging Initiation

When a VLR has to page a GPRS MS it shall check whether the MSC has an
SCCP connection for that MS. If no SCCP connection exists the VLR checks
the state of the association to an SGSN and the value of the restoration
indicators for that MS. The VLR sends BSSAP+-PAGING-REQUEST messages to
the SGSN if the state of the association for the MS is Gs-ASSOCIATED,
LA-UPDATE-PRESENT or if the state of the association is Gs-NULL and the
\'Confirmed by Radio Contact\' restoration indicator is set to
\'false\'. The sending of the BSSAP+-PAGING-REQUEST message does not
change the state of the association with the SGSN.

If the \'Confirmed by Radio Contact\' restoration indicator is set to
\'true\', the VLR shall include the Location area identifier IE into the
BSSAP+-PAGING-REQUEST message, otherwise (i.e. after a VLR failure) the
Location area identifier IE shall not be included. When sending the
BSSAP+-PAGING-REQUEST message, the VLR shall start timer T5.

If the state of the association is Gs-NULL and the restoration indicator
\'Confirmed by Radio Contact\' is set to \'false\', the VLR shall also
perform a search procedure as specified in 3GPP TS 23.018 \[6a\].

While domain specific access control of the PS domain is ongoing the VLR
shall be configured to send paging messages on the Gs, A and Iu-CS
interfaces.

Dependent on network configuration or operator policy, if the GPRS MS
did not respond to a first paging on Gs interface, and A/Iu-CS paging
has not been initiated already, the VLR may page on the A/Iu-CS
interface.

### 5.2.2 Paging Response

The VLR stops the paging procedure on expiry of timer T5 or on receipt
of an SCCP connection establishment containing the Initial L3 message
from the MS via the A or Iu-CS interface.

If the paging response is received from a location area which differs
from the one stored in the VLR, the VLR shall move the Gs association to
the Gs-NULL state after the MS has been authenticated successfully.

### 5.2.3 Paging Failure

On receipt of a BSSAP+-PAGING-REJECT message before the timer T5
expires, the VLR stops timer T5, the association is moved to the Gs-NULL
state and within this state the association is marked with the contents
of the Gs Cause IE.

### 5.2.4 MS unreachable

On receipt of a BSSAP+-MS-UNREACHABLE message before the timer T5
expires, the VLR stops timer T5 and the paging procedure for that paging
request towards the SGSN is stopped. The state of the association at the
VLR is not changed.

5.3 Procedures in the SGSN
--------------------------

The SGSN accepts BSSAP+-PAGING-REQUEST messages in any state of the
association apart from Gs-NULL. Nevertheless the SGSN also accepts
BSSAP+-PAGING-REQUEST messages in the Gs-NULL state if the
\'SGSN-Reset\' restoration indicator at the SGSN is set to \'true\'.
When an SGSN receives a BSSAP+-PAGING-REQUEST message from a VLR, the
SGSN shall first check if the MS is known by the SGSN. The handling of
the paging request depends on the state of the association and the MM
context variables at the SGSN:

a\) The MS is known and the restoration indicator \'SGSN-Reset\' at the
SGSN is set to \'false\':

\- If the MS is considered to be IMSI attached for GPRS and non-GPRS
services (i.e. the association is not in the state Gs-NULL), the SGSN
shall page the MS based on the location information stored in the SGSN.
If the location area stored in the SGSN differs from the one received in
the BSSAP+-PAGING-REQUEST message, the SGSN shall use the IMSI to page
the MS. If the BSSAP+-PAGING-REQUEST message does not include the
Location area identifier information element, the SGSN may set the
\"VLR-Reliable\" MM context variable to \"false\".

\- If the MS is marked as IMSI detached for GPRS services or IMSI
(implicitly or explicitly) detached for non-GPRS services (i.e. the
state of the association is Gs-NULL), the SGSN shall return a
BSSAP+-PAGING-REJECT message to that VLR indicating in the Gs Cause IE
the detach circumstance (\'IMSI detached for GPRS services\', \'IMSI
detached for non-GPRS services\' or \'IMSI implicitly detached for
non-GPRS services\').

\- If the MS is marked as unreachable (i.e. the PPF flag is set to
\'false\') the SGSN shall return a BSSAP+-MS-UNREACHABLE message to that
VLR indicating in the Gs Cause IE \'MS unreachable\'. The state of the
association does not change at the SGSN.

b\) The MS is known and the restoration indicator \'SGSN-Reset\' at the
SGSN is set to \'true\':

\- If the BSSAP+-PAGING-REQUEST message includes the Location area
identifier IE, the SGSN shall page the MS in all the routeing areas
served by the SGSN that are included in the location area indicated in
the Location area identifier IE.

\- If the BSSAP+-PAGING-REQUEST message does not include the Location
area identifier IE, the SGSN may page in all the routeing areas served
by the SGSN that are also served by the sending VLR.

NOTE 1: The SGSN can handle the paging request as a) for the purpose of
optimization if the MS is known.

c\) The MS is not known and the restoration indicator \'SGSN-Reset\' at
the SGSN is set to \'false\':

\- The SGSN shall return a BSSAP+-PAGING-REJECT message to that VLR
indicating in the Gs Cause IE \'IMSI unknown\'.

d\) The MS is not known and the restoration indicator \'SGSN-Reset\' at
the SGSN is set to \'true\':

\- If the VLR provides the Location area identifier IE, the SGSN shall
page within the location area indicated by the VLR. Otherwise the SGSN
may page in all the routeing areas served by the SGSN that are also
served by the sending VLR.

If the SGSN accepts the paging request, the SGSN shall process the
BSSAP+-PAGING-REQUEST message before sending the message on the Gb/Iu-PS
interface. The result of the processing on the BSSAP+-PAGING-REQUEST
message is the PAGING CS message (see 3GPP TS 48.018 \[15\]) sent on the
Gb interface or the PAGING message with CN Domain Indicator \'CS
domain\' (see 3GPP TS 25.413 \[22\]) sent on the Iu-PS interface.

The SGSN shall not retransmit the PAGING CS message on the Gb interface
or the PAGING message on the Iu-PS interface.

If within a location area there are cells that do not support GPRS
services, the SGSN shall group these cells under a \'null RA\'. The SGSN
will perform the paging procedure described above within both the RA(s)
derived from the location information and the \'null RA(s)\' of the
corresponding location area(s) (see 3GPP TS 24.008 \[11\]).

NOTE 2: The eMLPP priority information element relates to relative
priorities within the paged MS and not to the priority in the sending of
PAGING CS messages by the BSS.

6 Location Update for non-GPRS services procedure
=================================================

6.1 General description
-----------------------

The location update for non-GPRS services procedure is a general
procedure used by MSs in class-A mode of operation and MSs in class-B
mode of operation. This procedure is not performed if:

\- the subscriber data indicates that the MS has subscription for packet
only;

\- the MS indicates SMS only and the HLR indicates \"SMS in SGSN
Support\" and the SGSN supports SMS services.

NOTE: For the cases specified above, the registration with a VLR is not
required and the SGSN does not initiate the location update for non-GPRS
services procedure.

This procedure allows MSs and network to perform:

\- Combined IMSI attach for GPRS and non-GPRS services;

\- IMSI attach for non-GPRS services if the MS is already IMSI attached
for GPRS services;

\- IMSI attach for GPRS services indication to the VLR if the MS is
already IMSI attached for non-GPRS services;

\- Normal Location Update procedure to the VLR if the MS is IMSI
attached for both GPRS and non-GPRS services;

\- Reallocation of TMSI to an MS.

The Location Update for non-GPRS services procedures in the Gs interface
is always started as a consequence of a direct action by the MS. The
combined routeing area update procedure is further specified in 3GPP TS
23.060 \[8\] and 3GPP TS 24.008 \[11\].

The Location Update for non-GPRS services procedure is used by the SGSN
to forward to the VLR those parts of the combined routeing area update
or IMSI attach procedure which belong to the non-GPRS services. This
means that non-GPRS related requests which are included in the combined
request, are sent from the SGSN to the VLR. The procedure is also used
by the SGSN to indicate to the VLR when an IMSI attach to GPRS services
has been performed by an MS that was already IMSI attached to non-GPRS
services. The SGSN may also forward a BSSAP+-TMSI-REALLOCATION-COMPLETE
message from the MS to the VLR.

The VLR shall acknowledge the BSSAP+-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message.
When the VLR processes the request it does not perform authentication
because it relies on the SGSN\'s security functions.

When an MS is IMSI attached for GPRS and non-GPRS services, any implicit
detach timer in the VLR shall be stopped. Instead the Paging Proceed
Flag in the SGSN is used to determine the likely availability of the MS
to the network. Upon reception of the periodic Routeing Area Update
message the SGSN does not report to the VLR , and the state of the
association at the SGSN is not changed. When the MS performs a detach
only from the GPRS system, and the VLR\'s implicit detach timer is not
already running, the GPRS detach indication to the VLR shall cause the
VLR\'s implicit detach timer to be restarted from its initial value.

If the SGSN performs an implicit detach for both GPRS and non-GPRS
traffic, then the SGSN shall indicate to the VLR a
BSSAP+-IMSI-DETACH-INDICATION message with cause \'Implicit SGSN
initiated IMSI detach from GPRS and non-GPRS service\', as further
described in clause \'Implicit IMSI detach from non-GPRS service
procedure\' (the implicit IMSI detach message indicates that the MS is
unavailable for both GPRS and non-GPRS services).

The IMSI attach for GPRS services to the VLR, when the MS is already
IMSI attached for non-GPRS services, is requested by the MS sending a
combined IMSI attach for GPRS and non-GPRS services message to the SGSN,
as further specified in 3GPP TS 23.060 \[8\] and 3GPP TS 24.008 \[11\].

6.2 Procedures in the SGSN
--------------------------

The location update for non-GPRS services is initiated with a combined
routing area update procedure or a IMSI/GPRS attach procedure. On
receipt of an ATTACH REQUEST message or ROUTING AREA UPDATE REQUEST
message from the MS, the SGSN shall handle the GPRS related request as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 \[11\].

When the SGSN receives the MAP-INSERT-SUBSCRIBER-DATA message containing
subscription data from the HLR, the SGSN determines whether it needs to
perform location update for non-GPRS services procedure. For the cases
identified below, the SGSN sends response message to the MS without
starting the location update for non-GPRS services procedure:

\- if the Network Access Mode (NAM) subscription data indicates that the
MS has subscription for packet only (see 3GPP TS 29.272 \[28\]); or

\- if the combined attach or routing area update procedure indicates
that the MS has requested for GPRS services and \"SMS-only service\"
(see 3GPP TS 24.008 \[11\]) and the HLR indicates \"SMS in SGSN
Support\" and the SGSN supports SMS services.

Otherwise, the SGSN shall start the location update for non-GPRS
services procedure and wait for the outcome of both location update
procedures towards the VLR and the HLR before sending the response
message to the MS (see 3GPP TS 24.008 \[11\]).

Upon reception of the periodic Routeing Area Update message, if the EMM
Combined UE Waiting Flag is \'true\', the SGSN shall perform
network-initiated GPRS detach procedure with the detach type IE
indicating \"IMSI detach\" as specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 \[11\].

### 6.2.1 Location Update Initiation

#### 6.2.1.1 General

If timer T6-1 is not running, the SGSN shall start the location update
for non-GPRS service procedure when it receives from the MS:

\- an attach request indicating combined IMSI and GPRS attach;

\- an attach request indicating GPRS attach while IMSI attached;

\- a combined routing area update request indicating IMSI attach;

\- a combined routing area update request indicating that the Location
Area has changed;

\- a combined routing area update request if the MS Network Capability
IE indicates that **EMM combined procedures are supported by the MS;**

\- a combined routing area update request, if the state of the
association is Gs-NULL; or

\- a combined routing area update request when the SGSN serving the MS
has changed.

If timer T6-1 is not running, the SGSN may start the location update for
non-GPRS service procedure when it receives from the MS:

-   a combined routing area update request or a periodic routeing area
    update, if the \'VLR-Reliable\' MM context variable for the MS is
    set to \'false\' (see section 11.3).

For networks not supporting the feature \"Intra Domain Connection of RAN
Nodes to Multiple CN Nodes\" the number of the VLR is derived from the
RAI where the MS is camping. For networks supporting the feature 'Intra
Domain Connection of RAN Nodes to Multiple CN Nodes', the VLR number is
derived as described in 3GPP TS 23.236 \[26\]. The SGSN starts Timer
T6-1. The BSSAP+-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message includes the Old
location area identifier. If the SGSN received the old location area
identification from the MS and the network supports S1 mode, the SGSN
includes the old location area identification received from the MS as
the Old location area identifier. If the SGSN did not receive the old
location area identification from the MS or if the network does not
support S1 mode, the SGSN derives the Old location area identifier from
the old routing area identification received in the ROUTING AREA
UPDATING REQUEST message (see 3GPP TS 24.008 \[11\]). The SGSN shall
also include the New location area identifier where the MS is currently
camping. The new LAI is derived from the RAI.

If the VLR is configured for gateway core network (GWCN), the SGSN shall
select a core network operator as specified in 3GPP TS 23.251 \[24\] and
proceed as follows:

\- For supporting UEs, the SGSN includes the PLMN identity of the
selected core network operator in the New cell global identity
information element.

\- For non-supporting UEs, the SGSN includes the selected core network
operator in the Selected CN operator information element in the
BSSAP+-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message, and the common PLMN in the New
cell global identity information element.

In networks supporting the feature \"Intra Domain Connection of RAN
Nodes to Multiple CN Nodes\" (3GPP TS 23.236 \[26\]), if the TMSI based
NRI container is not received from the MS, and the SGSN determines that
the serving VLR of the MS is changed, the SGSN shall include in the Old
location area identifier a specific LAI value which is not broadcasted
in the network and not associated with any VLR.

NOTE 1: The SGSN determines that the serving VLR of the MS is changed
when the Gs association changes from one serving VLR to a different one,
or based on implementation dependent criteria.

NOTE 2: When the VLR receives the BSSAP+-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message
with the specific LAI value, the VLR retrieves the MM context of the MS
from the HLR.

In networks supporting the feature \"Intra Domain Connection of RAN
Nodes to Multiple CN Nodes\", the SGSN shall support load
re-distribution of MSs to another VLR than the current one as follows:

> When the SGSN receives a periodic routeing area update request or a
> combined routing area update request, the SGSN shall check whether for
> this MS there is an association to a VLR for which load
> re-distribution has been initiated in the SGSN by O&M. If yes and

\- if a combined routing area update request is received, the SGSN shall
derive the new VLR number as described in 3GPP TS 23.236 \[26\] and then
send the BSSAP+-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message to the new selected VLR;
or

\- if a periodic routing area update request is received, dependent on
network configuration and operator policy, the SGSN shall take one of
the following actions:

\- perform a network initiated detach with detach type \"IMSI detach\"
immediately after the completion of the periodic routing area updating
procedure; or

\- derive the new VLR number as described in 3GPP TS 23.236 \[26\] and
then send the BSSAP+-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message to the new selected
VLR.

The BSSAP+-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message includes the type of location
update performed by the MS in the GPRS location update type IE. If the
MS has performed a combined attach request or a combined routing and
location area update request with IMSI attach, the SGSN indicates \'IMSI
attach\', otherwise the SGSN indicates \'Normal location update\'.

The BSSAP+-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message shall include the TMSI status
if received from the MS.

The SGSN shall include the TMSI based NRI container in the
BSSAP+-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message if received from the MS.

If the SGSN supports the \"Provision of UE Specific Behaviour
Information to Network Entities\" (see 3GPP TS 23.195 \[23\]), or the
\"Automatic Device Detection\" (see 3GPP TS 22.101 \[23A\]) or the
\"Trace for Management Based Activation/Deactivation \" (see 3GPP TS
32.422 \[25\]),, the BSSAP+-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message shall
include the IMEISV.

If timer T6-1 is running:

If the SGSN receives from the MS:

\- an attach request indicating combined IMSI and GPRS attach;

\- an attach request indicating GPRS attach while IMSI attached; or

\- a combined routing area update request with or without IMSI attach.

Then:

\- if the new LAI is the same as in the outstanding request, the SGSN
shall not process this new request and shall wait for the VLR\'s
response to the ongoing procedure; or

\- if the new LAI is different but is in the same VLR as the outstanding
request:

\- any response from the VLR to the oustanding request is ignored;

\- Timer T6-1 shall be stopped and reset; and

\- The SGSN shall start the location update for non-GPRS service
procedure; or

\- if the new LAI is different, and is in a different VLR to the
outstanding request:

\- any response from the previously addressed VLR to the oustanding
request is ignored;

\- Timer T6-1 shall be stopped and reset; and

\- the SGSN shall start the location update for non-GPRS service
procedure.

When the SGSN receives from the MS a routing area update request and the
SGSN serving the MS has changed, the SGSN shall stop and reset timer
T6-1.

#### 6.2.1.2 VLR fails without restart

If the SGSN supports restoration for CS services via an alternative VLR
as defined in 3GPP TS 23.007 \[6\] and, upon reception of a combined
routeing area update request or periodic routeing area update request
from the MS, the SGSN detects that the VLR serving the MS is no longer
in service, the SGSN may:

\- if a combined routing area update request is received, select an
alternative VLR that is in service for the MS and immediately perform
the location update for non-GPRS services procedure towards the selected
VLR as described in clause 6; or

\- if a periodic routing area update request is received, dependent on
network configuration and operator policy,

\- perform a network initiated detach with detach type \"IMSI detach\"
immediately after the completion of the periodic routing area update
procedure and then select an alternative VLR that is in service for the
MS during the subsequent combined routeing area update procedure, before
performing the location update for non-GPRS services procedure towards
the selected VLR as described in clause 6; or

\- select an alternative VLR that is in service for the MS and
immediately perform the location update for non-GPRS services procedure
towards the selected VLR as described in clause 6.

NOTE: How an SGSN detects a VLR is no longer in service and triggers
selection of alternative VLR is implementation dependent.

### 6.2.2 Location Update Response

If the SGSN receives a BSSAP+-LOCATION-UPDATE-ACCEPT message from the
VLR, the SGSN shall:

stop timer T6-1; and

\- move the state of the association to Gs-ASSOCIATED;

\- set the the MM context variable \'VLR-Reliable\' to \'true\';

\- set the the MM context variable \'EMM Combined UE Waiting Flag\' to
\'false\'; and

\- indicate to the MS the acceptance of the VLR to the Location Update
procedure. The message to the MS includes the Routeing Area Identity,
from which the MS is able to extract the location area identity for
which the location update procedure succeeded (see 3GPP TS
24.008 \[11\]).

The SGSN shall wait for the outcome of the Location Update for non-GPRS
service procedure towards the VLR before sending a response to location
update procedure to the MS. Any Reject cause that needs to be reported
to the MS is specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 \[11\].

If the VLR included the Mobile Identity IE in the
BSSAP+-LOCATION-UPDATE-ACCEPT message, the SGSN shall forward the
information received to the MS. If the Mobile Identity IE contains a new
TMSI it will cause the MS to perform a TMSI reallocation procedure,
while an IMSI causes the MS to deallocate its TMSI. In case a new TMSI
was allocated for the MS the SGSN shall send to the VLR the
BSSAP+-TMSI-REALLOCATION-COMPLETE message when the SGSN receives Attach
Complete or the the Routeing Area Complete message from the MS.

### 6.2.3 Location Update Failure

If the SGSN receives a BSSAP+-LOCATION-UPDATE-REJECT message from the
VLR, the SGSN shall:

\- stop timer T6-1;

\- move the state of the association to Gs-NULL; and

\- indicate to the MS the rejection of the VLR of the Location Update
procedure as specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 \[11\]. The Reject cause value
sent by the VLR shall be forwarded to the MS.

### 6.2.4 Abnormal cases

If timer T6-1 expires, the SGSN shall abort the Location Update for
non-GPRS service procedure and indicate this to the MS with the Reject
cause value \'MSC temporarily not reachable\'. The state of the
association to the VLR shall be Gs-NULL.

If the SGSN receives a BSSAP+LOCATION-UPDATE-ACCEPT message and timer
T6-1 is not running then:

\- if timer T8 is running (see clause 8), the message shall be ignored;

\- if timer T9 is running (see clause 9), the message shall be ignored;
or

\- if timers T8 and T9 are not running:

\- if the state of the association to the VLR is GS-ASSOCIATED, the
message shall be ignored; or

\- if the state of the association to the VLR is different than
GS-ASSOCIATED, the message shall be treated as a message incompatible
with the protocol state of the SGSN (see clause 16.3).

6.3 Procedures in the VLR
-------------------------

When a VLR receives a BSSAP+-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message it checks
whether the IMSI is known. If the IMSI is not known the VLR retrieves
the MM context of the MS from the HLR.

In networks supporting the feature 'Intra Domain Connection of RAN Nodes
to Multiple CN Nodes' (3GPP TS 23.236 \[26\]), if the TMSI based NRI
container is received in the BSSAP+-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message, the
VLR derives the NRI value. If the NRI value is not allocated by the VLR,
the VLR retrieves the MM context of the UE from the HSS.

When the VLR is configured for gateway core network (GWCN), the VLR
shall select the serving core network operator as follows:

-   If the Selected CN operator information element is received in the
    BSSAP+-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message, the VLR shall select the
    serving core network operator as specified in the Selected CN
    operator information element;

-   If the Selected CN operator information element is not received in
    the BSSAP+-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message and the PLMN identity
    included in the New cell global identity information element
    identifies a core network operator, the VLR shall select the serving
    core network operator as specified in the New cell global identity
    information element;

-   Otherwise, the VLR selects the serving core network operator based
    on local policies.

For a VLR supporting the \"Provision of UE Specific Behaviour
Information to Network Entities\" (see 3GPP TS 23.195 \[23\]) the
following applies:

\- The VLR shall store the IMEISV value received in the
BSSAP+-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message in the MM context for that MS.

\- If the VLR receives a BSSAP+-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message without
IMEISV information element, the MSC/VLR shall request the IMEISV from
the MS at the next Iu-CS or A interface connection establishment.

### 6.3.1 Location Update Response

If the Location Update is accepted by the VLR and, if necessary by the
HLR, the VLR shall:

\- move the association to the Gs-ASSOCIATED state;

\- set the restoration indicator \'Confirmed by Radio Contact\' to
\'true\';

\- update the association by storing the SGSN number included in the
BSSAP+-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message; and

\- send a BSSAP+-LOCATION-UPDATE-ACCEPT message to the sending SGSN.
This message includes the Location Area Identification received in the
new Cell Global Identity IE in the previous
BSSAP+-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message.

### 6.3.2 Location Update Failure

If the Location Update is rejected by the VLR it shall:

\- Send a BSSAP+-LOCATION-UPDATE-REJECT message to the SGSN with the
appropriate reject cause as indicated in 3GPP TS 24.008 \[11\] and
indicate to the SGSN the Location area identifier received in the
corresponding BSSAP+-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message; and

\- Move the association from any state to Gs-NULL.

### 6.3.3 TMSI reallocation procedure

If the VLR decides to reallocate the TMSI to the MS it shall include the
new TMSI in the BSSAP+-LOCATION-UPDATE-ACCEPT message. If the VLR
decides to deallocate the TMSI of the MS it shall include the IMSI of
the MS in the BSSAP+-LOCATION-UPDATE-ACCEPT message. After sending the
BSSAP+-LOCATION-UPDATE-ACCEPT message with a new TMSI the VLR starts
timer T6-2.

NOTE: In the BSSAP+-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST the SGSN may indicate, that
there is no valid TMSI available in the MS. This information may be used
by the VLR to decide whether to reallocate a new TMSI to the MS.

Upon receipt of the BSSAP+-TMSI-REALLOCATION-COMPLETE message, the VLR
stops the timer T6-2 and considers the new TMSI as valid.

If an IMSI was sent to the MS, the VLR considers the old TMSI if
available, as deleted.

If no BSSAP+-TMSI-REALLOCATION-COMPLETE message is received by the VLR
before the timer T6-2 expires, the VLR aborts the TMSI reallocation
procedure. The VLR shall consider old TMSI if available, occupied until
the new TMSI is used in a subsequent A/Iu message, or for an
implementation dependent time. The VLR may still perform the TMSI
reallocation procedure via the A or Iu-CS interface. The outcome of the
TMSI reallocation procedure does not change the state of the
association. The VLR uses the IMSI or the new TMSI or, if available, the
old TMSI for paging.

### 6.3.4 Abnormal cases

The following abnormal cases can be identified:

i\) MM signalling via the A or Iu-CS interface

If the VLR receives a Location Update request or an IMSI detach
indication from the MS by the A or Iu-CS interface when the state of the
association in the VLR is not Gs-NULL, the VLR shall move the state of
the association to Gs-NULL.

ii\) Additional Location Update Request

If the state of the association in the VLR is in the LA-UPDATE PRESENT
state and a BSSAP+-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message is received, then:

\- If the message is from the same SGSN and indicates the same New
Location Area as the outstanding location update request, then this
additional BSSAP+-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message shall be ignored;

\- If the message is from the same SGSN but indicates a different New
Location Area to the outstanding location update request, then this
additional BSSAP+-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message shall be treated and
the VLR shall not send any response to the previous
BSSAP+-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message; or

\- If the message is from a different SGSN (indicating either the same
or different New Location Area) to the outstanding location update
request, then this additional BSSAP+-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message
shall be treated and the VLR shall not send any response to the previous
BSSAP+-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message.

iii\) Detach signalling from SGSN

If the state of the association in the VLR is in the LA-UPDATE PRESENT
state and either a BSSAP+-GPRS-DETACH-INDICATION or a
BSSAP+-IMSI-DETACH-INDICATION message is received, then, the Location
Update for non-GPRS services procedure shall be abandoned in the VLR
(neither a BSSAP+LOCATION-UPDATE-ACCEPT nor a
BSSAP+LOCATION-UPDATE-REJECT messages is sent) and the further actions
described in clauses 8 or 9 or 10 are followed.

iv\) Signalling via SGs interface

If the VLR receives for a UE a SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message (as
defined in 3GPP TS 29.118 \[27\]) from an MME when the state of the
association for this UE in the VLR is not Gs-NULL, the VLR shall move
the state of the association to Gs-NULL.

v\) New Location Update Request during TMSI reallocation procedure

If the VLR receives a BSSAP+-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message while T6-2
is running, the VLR shall stop timer T6-2, abort the TMSI reallocation
procedure and proceed with the new location update for non-GPRS services
procedure. If the VLR needs to page the MS during the new location
update for non-GPRS services procedure, the VLR uses the IMSI or the new
TMSI from the aborted TMSI reallocation procedure or, if available, the
old TMSI for paging.

vi\) Reset signalling from SGSN

If the state of the association in the VLR is in the LA-UPDATE PRESENT
state and a BSSAP+-RESET-INDICATION message is received from the SGSN,
then, the Location Update for non-GPRS services procedure shall be
abandoned in the VLR (neither a BSSAP+LOCATION-UPDATE-ACCEPT nor a
BSSAP+LOCATION-UPDATE-REJECT messages is sent) and the further actions
described in clause 12 are followed.

7 Non-GPRS alert procedure
==========================

7.1 General description
-----------------------

This procedure is used by the VLR to request from an SGSN an indication
when activity (either signalling or data transmission) from an MS is
detected. This procedure can be invoked at any time by the VLR. The
BSSAP+-ALERT-REQUEST message shall be acknowledged by the SGSN.

7.2 Procedures in the VLR
-------------------------

### 7.2.1 Alert Initiation

The VLR may start the Non-GPRS alert procedure at any time. When the VLR
wants to request to an SGSN that further activity from an MS shall
reported by the SGSN, the VLR shall send an BSSAP+-ALERT-REQUEST message
to that SGSN. The VLR starts timer T7 when the BSSAP+-ALERT-REQUEST
message is sent.

### 7.2.2 Alert Response

When a BSSAP+-ALERT-ACK message is received, the VLR shall stop the
timer T7. The state of the association is not changed.

### 7.2.3 Alert failure

If a BSSAP+-ALERT-REJECT message is received, the VLR shall stop the
timer T7, move the state of the association to Gs-NULL and within this
state the association is marked with the contents of the Gs Cause IE.

### 7.2.4 Alert Indication

The VLR shall not change the state of the association upon reception of
an BSSAP+-MS-ACTIVITY-INDICATION message.

### 7.2.5 Abnormal cases

If no BSSAP+-ALERT-ACK message is received before the timer T7 expires,
the VLR shall retransmit the BSSAP+-ALERT-REQUEST message a maximum of
N7 times. If no BSSAP+-ALERT-ACK message is received after that, a
report shall be made to the O&M system. The state of the association is
not changed.

7.3 Procedures in the SGSN
--------------------------

### 7.3.1 Alert response

The SGSN may receive a BSSAP+-ALERT-REQUEST message at any state of the
association. Upon receipt of an BSSAP+-ALERT-REQUEST message from the
VLR and if the IMSI is known in the SGSN, the SGSN shall reply with a
BSSAP+-ALERT-ACK message and set the NGAF.

### 7.3.2 Alert failure

If a BSSAP+-ALERT-REQUEST message is received for an IMSI that is
unknown at the SGSN, the SGSN shall return a BSSAP+-ALERT-REJECT message
to the VLR indicating the Gs Cause IE value \'IMSI unknown\'.

### 7.3.3 Alert indication

The SGSN shall to report to the VLR upon detection of any activity
(either signalling or data) from the MS if the NGAF is set. If the SGSN
detects GPRS signalling that leads to a procedure towards the VLR, the
SGSN shall follow this procedure and reset the NGAF. If the SGSN detects
activity that does not lead to any procedure towards the VLR, the SGSN
shall send an BSSAP+-MS-ACTIVITY-INDICATION message towards the VLR and
reset the NGAF.

8 Explicit IMSI detach from GPRS services procedure
===================================================

8.1 General description
-----------------------

This procedure is used by the SGSN to indicate to the VLR that the MS
has been IMSI detached from GPRS service and therefore the association
between the SGSN and the VLR has to be deactivated. This procedure only
applies to MSs that are not in the Gs-NULL state at the SGSN. The
procedures specified in this clause apply to GPRS detach indication
initiated by the MS or by the network as specified in 3GPP TS
23.060 \[8\].

The procedure is also used by the SGSN to indicate to the VLR when a
combined Routing and Location Area Update procedure has been rejected by
the SGSN.

The procedure is also used by the SGSN to indicate to the VLR when a
periodic Routing Area Update procedure has been rejected by the SGSN for
an MS for which a Gs association exists.

The Explicit IMSI detach from GPRS services procedure aborts any other
ongoing procedure related to this MS on the Gs interface in the SGSN and
in the VLR.

The VLR and the MS should be synchronised as to whether the PBCCH or the
BCCH is used, for any of the subsequent paging. In order to achieve
this, the SGSN shall attempt to inform the VLR about the detach event by
using a retry scheme if the initial delivery of the
BSSAP+-GPRS-DETACH-INDICATION message fails.

8.2 Procedures in the SGSN
--------------------------

### 8.2.1 Explicit GPRS detach initiation

The SGSN shall send a BSSAP+-GPRS-DETACH-INDICATION message to a VLR if:

\- The SGSN receives a GPRS only detach from the MS;

\- The SGSN performs network-initiated GPRS detach procedure;

\- The combined Routing and Location Area Update procedure is rejected
at the SGSN; or

\- The periodic Routing Area Update procedure is rejected at the SGSN
for an MS for which a Gs association exists.

If the SGSN receives a Detach Request from an MS and the state of the
association to a VLR for that MS is not Gs-NULL, the SGSN shall check
the detach type indicated in the message. If the MS is indicating GPRS
detach the SGSN shall send a BSSAP+-GPRS-DETACH-INDICATION message to
the VLR indicating \'MS initiated IMSI detach from GPRS service\'.

If the SGSN decides to perform a network-initiated GPRS detach and the
state of the association to a VLR for that MS is not Gs-NULL, the SGSN
shall send a BSSAP+-GPRS-DETACH-INDICATION message to the VLR indicating
\'Network initiated IMSI detach from GPRS service\'.

If the combined Routing and Location Area Update procedure or periodic
Routing Area Update procedure is rejected at the SGSN for an MS with an
association state different from Gs-NULL, the SGSN shall send a
BSSAP+-GPRS-DETACH-INDICATION to the VLR indicating \'GPRS services not
allowed\'. The SGSN then sends, for example, a Routing Area Update
Reject message as specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 \[11\].

After the sending of the BSSAP+-GPRS-DETACH-INDICATION message, the SGSN
shall move the state of the association to Gs-NULL. The SGSN shall start
timer T8 upon transmission of the BSSAP+-GPRS-DETACH-INDICATION message
and if timer T6-1 is running, timer T6-1 shall be stopped and reset.

### 8.2.2 Explicit GPRS detach Response

If the SGSN receives a BSSAP+-GPRS-DETACH-ACK message from the VLR, the
SGSN shall stop timer T8. The SGSN shall not wait for the reception of
the BSSAP+-GPRS-DETACH-ACK message before sending (if needed) the
confirmation of the detach to the MS.

### 8.2.3 Abnormal cases

If no BSSAP+-GPRS-DETACH-ACK message is received by the SGSN to a
previous BSSAP+-GPRS-DETACH-INDICATION message before timer T8 expires,
the SGSN shall repeat the BSSAP+-GPRS-DETACH-INDICATION message a
maximum of N8 times. If no BSSAP+-GPRS-DETACH-ACK message is received
after that, a report shall be made to the O&M system. The state of the
association during the acknowledgement procedure remains Gs-NULL.

8.3 Procedures in the VLR
-------------------------

When a VLR receives a BSSAP+-GPRS-DETACH-INDICATION message, the VLR
shall send a BSSAP+-GPRS-DETACH-ACK message to the sending SGSN. The
state of the association for the MS shall be moved from any state to
Gs-NULL. The VLR marks the association as \'IMSI detached for GPRS
services\' with the reason indicated in the IMSI detach from GPRS
service type IE.

If the VLR\'s implicit detach timer is not running then, the VLR shall
set and restart the implicit detach timer upon reception of a
BSSAP+-GPRS-DETACH-INDICATION message. If the VLR\'s implicit detach
timer is running (ie the state of the association was already Gs-NULL)
then, the reception of a BSSAP+-GPRS-DETACH-INDICATION message shall not
affect the VLR\'s implicit detach timer.

9 Explicit IMSI detach from non-GPRS services procedure
=======================================================

9.1 General description
-----------------------

This procedure is used by the SGSN to indicate to the VLR that the MS
has performed IMSI detach from non-GPRS services and therefore the
association between the SGSN and the VLR has to be deactivated. This
procedure only applies to MSs that are not in the Gs-NULL state at the
SGSN. The procedures specified in this clause only apply to IMSI detach
or combined IMSI and GPRS detach requests.

The explicit IMSI detach from non-GPRS services procedure aborts any
other ongoing procedure related to this MS on the Gs interface in the
SGSN and in the VLR.

The VLR and the MS should be synchronised as to whether the PBCCH or the
BCCH is used, for any of the subsequent paging. In order to achieve
this, the SGSN shall attempt to inform the VLR about the detach event by
using a retry scheme if the initial delivery of the
BSSAP+-IMSI-DETACH-INDICATION message fails.

9.2 Procedures in the SGSN
--------------------------

### 9.2.1 Explicit IMSI detach initiation

When an SGSN receives a Detach Request from an MS which is not in the
Gs-NULL state, it shall check the detach type indicated. If the MS is
indicating IMSI detach or combined IMSI and GPRS detach the SGSN shall
send an BSSAP+-IMSI-DETACH-INDICATION message to the VLR indicating
\'Explicit MS initiated IMSI detach from non-GPRS service\' or
\'Combined explicit MS initiated IMSI detach from GPRS and non-GPRS
services\'.

After the sending of the BSSAP+-IMSI-DETACH-INDICATION message to the
VLR, the SGSN shall move the state of the association to Gs-NULL. The
SGSN shall start timer T9 upon transmission of the
BSSAP+-IMSI-DETACH-INDICATION message and if timer T6-1 is running,
timer T6-1 shall be stopped and reset..

### 9.2.2 Explicit IMSI detach Response

If the SGSN receives a BSSAP+-IMSI-DETACH-ACK message from the VLR, the
SGSN shall stop timer T9. If the detach type received from the MS
indicated IMSI only detach or combined IMSI and GPRS detach not due to
switch off, the SGSN shall wait for the reception of the
BSSAP+-IMSI-DETACH-ACK message before sending the confirmation of the
detach to the MS.

### 9.2.3 Abnormal cases

i\) with switch off

If the SGSN sent a BSSAP+-IMSI-DETACH-INDICATION message for a combined
IMSI and GPRS detach due to switch off and timer T9 expires, the SGSN
shall repeat the BSSAP+-IMSI-DETACH-INDICATION message a maximum of N9
times.

ii\) with no switch off

If the SGSN sent a BSSAP+-IMSI-DETACH-INDICATION message for a IMSI only
detach or a combined IMSI and GPRS detach not due to switch off and
timer T9 expires, the SGSN shall repeat the
BSSAP+-IMSI-DETACH-INDICATION message a maximum of N9 times. If no
BSSAP+-IMSI-DETACH-ACK is received after that the SGSN shall send the
confirmation of the detach to the MS.

9.3 Procedures in the VLR
-------------------------

When a VLR receives an BSSAP+-IMSI-DETACH-INDICATION message, the VLR
shall send an BSSAP+-IMSI-DETACH-ACK message to the sending SGSN. The
state of the association for the MS shall be moved from any state to
Gs-NULL. If the BSSAP+-IMSI-DETACH-INDICATION message indicated
\'Explicit MS initiated IMSI detach from non-GPRS service\', the VLR
marks the association as \'IMSI detached for non-GPRS services\'. If the
BSSAP+-IMSI-DETACH-INDICATION message indicated \'Combined explicit MS
initiated IMSI detach from GPRS and non-GPRS services\', the VLR marks
the association as \'IMSI detached for GPRS and non-GPRS services\'. The
VLR shall mark the MS as detached.

10 Implicit IMSI detach from non-GPRS services procedure
========================================================

10.1 General description
------------------------

This procedure is used by the SGSN to indicate when, based on the
criteria for implicit detach as specified in 3GPP TS 23.060 \[8\], the
SGSN has decided to delete the GMM context of an MS or mark its GMM
context as detached. This procedure only applies to MSs that are not in
the Gs-NULL state at the SGSN.

The implicit IMSI detach from non-GPRS services procedure aborts any
other ongoing procedure related to this MS on the Gs interface in the
SGSN and in the VLR.

The VLR and the MS should be synchronised as to whether the PBCCH or the
BCCH is used, for any of the subsequent paging. In order to achieve
this, the SGSN shall attempt to inform the VLR about the detach event by
using a retry scheme if the initial delivery of the
BSSAP+-IMSI-DETACH-INDICATION message fails.

10.2 Procedures in the SGSN
---------------------------

When the implicit IMSI detach from non-GPRS services procedure is
started for an MS, the SGSN shall send a BSSAP+-IMSI-DETACH-INDICATION
message to the VLR indicating \'Implicit SGSN initiated IMSI detach from
GPRS and non-GPRS service\'.

After the sending of the BSSAP+-IMSI-DETACH-INDICATION message, the SGSN
shall move the state of the association to Gs-NULL. The SGSN shall start
timer T10 upon transmission of the BSSAP+-IMSI-DETACH-INDICATION
message.

If the SGSN receives a BSSAP+-IMSI-DETACH-ACK message from the VLR, the
SGSN shall stop timer T10.

If no BSSAP+-IMSI-DETACH-ACK message is received by the SGSN to a
previous BSSAP+-IMSI-DETACH-INDICATION message before timer T10 expires,
the SGSN shall repeat the BSSAP+-IMSI-DETACH-INDICATION message a
maximum of N10 times. The state of the association during the
acknowledgement procedure remains Gs-NULL.

10.3 Procedures in the VLR
--------------------------

When a VLR receives the BSSAP+-IMSI-DETACH-INDICATION message, the VLR
shall send an BSSAP+-IMSI-DETACH-ACK message to the sending SGSN. In
addition, if the state of the Gs association is not Gs-NULL, the VLR
proceeds as follows:

\- The VLR shall move the state of the association for the MS to
Gs-NULL. If the VLR does not have a signalling connection for the MS,
the VLR shall mark the MS as detached. Additionally, the VLR marks the
association as \'IMSI implicitly detached for GPRS and non-GPRS
services\'.

11 VLR failure procedure
========================

11.1 General description
------------------------

This procedure is used by the VLR to inform the associated SGSNs about
the recovery from an internal failure that has affected the association
with the SGSNs when the VLR fails with restart.

The VLR recovery procedure shall be handled in such a way that the
signalling load on the VLR and SGSN does not create any overload
problem.

11.2 Procedures in the VLR
--------------------------

### 11.2.1 VLR Reset Initiation

In the event of a failure at the VLR which has resulted in the loss of
SGSN association information on some MSs, the VLR shall move from any
state to the Gs-NULL state for these MSs. The VLR shall also set the
\'Confirmed by Radio Contact\' restoration indicator to \'false\' (see
3GPP TS 23.007 \[6\]) for affected MSs. The VLR shall not send any
BSSAP+- MS-INFORMATION-REQUEST or BSSAP+-MM-INFORMATION-REQUEST messages
to MSs with the SGSN association in the Gs-NULL state.

When the VLR restarts a BSSAP+-RESET-INDICATION message shall be sent to
all the SGSNs connected to the VLR by the Gs interface. This message
indicates to the SGSN that for the MSs with an association to that VLR,
the association is no longer reliable. The VLR shall also start timer
T11.

### 11.2.2 VLR Reset Response

Upon receipt of a BSSAP+-RESET-ACK message, the VLR shall stop the timer
T11.

### 11.2.3 Abnormal cases

If the VLR does not receive a BSSAP+-RESET-ACK message from that SGSN
before the T11 timer expires, the VLR shall retransmit the
BSSAP+-RESET-INDICATION message. The retransmission is repeated a
maximum of N11 times. If no BSSAP+-RESET-ACK is received after that a
report shall be made to the O&M system.

11.3 Procedures in the SGSN
---------------------------

### 11.3.1 VLR reset indication

Upon receipt of a BSSAP+-RESET-INDICATION message from the VLR, the SGSN
is informed that all the associations with that VLR for all the MSs
registered in the SGSN are no longer reliable because the VLR may have
lost information about the state of the MSs and during the failure the
VLR may have missed signalling messages. The SGSN shall set the
\'VLR-Reliable\' MM context variable to \'false\'. The detach procedures
for deleting the association are still applicable (clauses 8, 9 and 10).

The SGSN sends a BSSAP+-RESET-ACK message to the VLR.

If the \'VLR-Reliable\' MM context variable is set to \'false\', upon
reception of a combined routing area update request or a periodic
routing area update request from the MS that is attached for non-GPRS
service, the SGSN may:

\- if a combined routing area update request is received, immediately
perform the location update for non-GPRS services procedure towards the
VLR as described in clause 6; or

\- if a periodic routing area update request is received, dependent on
network configuration and operator policy,

\- perform a network initiated detach with detach type \"IMSI detach\"
immediately after the completion of the periodic routing area update
procedure; or

\- perform immediately the location update for non-GPRS services
procedure towards the VLR as described in clause 6.

### 11.3.2 Void

12 SGSN failure procedure
=========================

12.1 General description
------------------------

This procedure is used by the SGSN to inform the associated VLRs about
the recovery from an internal failure that has affected the association
with the VLRs.

The SGSN recovery procedure shall be handled in such a way that the
signalling load on the VLR and SGSN does not create any overload
problem.

12.2 Procedures in the SGSN
---------------------------

### 12.2.1 SGSN Reset Initiation

In the event of a failure at the SGSN which has resulted in the loss of
VLR association information on some MSs, the SGSN shall move from any
state to the Gs-NULL state for these affected MSs. The SGSN shall also
set the \'SGSN-Reset\' MM context variable to \'true\' and start the
timer T12-1. When the timer T12-1 expires the \'SGSN-Reset\' MM context
variable is set to \'false\'. The value of the timer T12-1 shall be
longer that the periodic routing area update timer at the SGSN.

A BSSAP+-RESET-INDICATION message may be sent to all the VLRs connected
to the SGSN by Gs interfaces. The BSSAP+-RESET-INDICATION message
indicates to the VLR that all the associations with that particular SGSN
for all the MSs registered in the VLR are no longer reliable. The normal
procedures for updating the association are still applicable (clauses 6,
8, 9 and 10). The SGSN shall also start timer T12-2.

If no BSSAP+-RESET-INDICATION is sent, the SGSN shall move from any
state to the Gs-NULL state only the associations of the MSs affected by
the loss of VLR association information.

NOTE: The option to not send any BSSAP+-RESET-INDICATION message to all
the VLRs connected to the SGSN by Gs interfaces reduces subsequent
paging signalling initiated by VLRs by avoiding a complete search of the
MS on the entire VLR area.

### 12.2.2 SGSN Reset Response

Upon receipt of a BSSAP+-RESET-ACK message, the SGSN shall stop the
timer T12-2.

### 12.2.3 Abnormal cases

If the SGSN does not receive a BSSAP+-RESET-ACK message from that VLR
before the T12-2 timer expires, the SGSN shall retransmit the
BSSAP+-RESET-INDICATION message. The retransmission is repeated a
maximum of N12 times. If no BSSAP+-RESET-ACK is received after a report
shall be to made the O&M system.

12.3 Procedures in the VLR
--------------------------

Upon receipt of a BSSAP+-RESET-INDICATION message from the SGSN, the VLR
is informed that all the associations with that SGSN for all the MSs
registered in the SGSN are no longer reliable because the SGSN may have
lost information about the state of the MSs for that VLR and during the
failure the SGSN may have missed signalling messages. The VLR shall
either:

\- set the \'Confirmed by Radio Contact\' restoration indicator to
\'false\' in all the associations containing the restarted SGSN and set
the state of all the Gs associations containing the restarted SGSN to
the Gs-NULL state; or

\- keep the \'Confirmed by Radio Contact\' restoration indication and
the state of all the Gs associations containing the restarted SGSN
unchanged.

NOTE: The option to not set the \'Confirmed by Radio Contact\'
restoration indicator to \'false\' in all the associations containing
the restarted SGSN reduces subsequent paging signalling the VLR can
initiate by avoiding a complete search of the MS on the entire VLR area.

The VLR shall then send a BSSAP+-RESET-ACK message to the SGSN.

If the \'Confirmed by Radio Contact\' restoration indicator is \'false\'
the VLR may send paging messages on the Gs, A and Iu-CS interfaces.

13 HLR failure
==============

This clause decribes the SGSN behaviour towards the VLR as a consequence
of an HLR reset.

13.1 General description
------------------------

In the case of an HLR failure, the HLR informs the associated SGSNs
about the recovery from an internal failure that has affected the
association with the SGSNs according to the HLR reset procedure
specified in 3GPP TS 29.002 \[17\].

This information is used in the SGSN to trigger the VLR to perform a
location update towards the HLR in order to restore the HLR subscriber
data.

13.2 Procedures in the SGSN
---------------------------

Upon receipt of a HLR reset indication from the HLR, the SGSN shall set
the NGAF for all registered MSs in the SGSN for which a valid
MSC/VLR-association exists.

Upon detection of any activity (either signalling or data) from the MS,
the SGSN shall report to the VLR if the NGAF is set for this MS. If the
SGSN detects GPRS signalling that leads to a procedure towards the VLR,
the SGSN shall follow this procedure and reset the NGAF. If the SGSN
detects activity that does not lead to any procedure towards the VLR,
the SGSN shall send an BSSAP+-MS-ACTIVITY-INDICATION message towards the
VLR and reset the NGAF. The activity indication may be delayed by the
SGSN for a maximum operator-configuration depending time period to avoid
high signalling load.

14 MS Information procedure
===========================

14.1 General description
------------------------

The MS Information procedure is used by the VLR to request specific
parameters about the MS. If the target MS for an MS Information
procedure or a Provide Subscriber Info procedure (see 3GPP TS
23.018 \[6a\] and 3GPP TS 29.002 \[17\]) is GPRS attached (i.e. the
state of the association to Gs-ASSOCIATED) the VLR may decide to perform
the procedure via GPRS. The outcome of the MS Information procedure does
not change the state of the association at the VLR or SGSN.

14.2 Procedures in the VLR
--------------------------

If the target MS for the MS information procedure is GPRS attached and
the state of the association for the MS Gs-ASSOCIATED, the VLR may
initiate the MS information procedure by transferring a
BSSAP+-MS-INFORMATION-REQUEST message to the SGSN. If the state of the
association is LA-UPDATE PRESENT, the VLR shall wait until this state is
exited. The VLR starts the timer T14. The BSSAP+-MS-INFORMATION-REQUEST
message specifies the requested information parameters in the
Information requested information element.

Upon receipt of a BSSAP+-MS-INFORMATION-RESPONSE the VLR shall stop
timer T14. If no BSSAP+-MS-INFORMATION-RESPONSE for that MS is received
before the expiry of timer T14the VLR shall stop the Gs interface MS
information procedure. The VLR may perform other actions to obtain the
information about the MS (e.g. retry, or send a DTAP IDENTITY REQUEST
message on the A interface).

14.3 Procedures in the SGSN
---------------------------

The SGSN shall examine the type of information that is requested and if
it is stored in its database shall use this information in its response
to the VLR. The BSSAP+-MS-INFORMATION-RESPONSE message contains the
information parameters as requested by the VLR. In A/Gb mode, the Mobile
location information indicates a request for Cell Global Identity and
Location information age. In Iu mode, the Mobile location information
indicates a request for Service Area Identification and Location
information age. In this case, the SGSN shall use the Location Report
Control procedure (see 3GPP TS 25.413 \[22\]) in order to retrieve the
SA.

If the SGSN receives an Information requested information element
containing a \'not supported\' value, then the value part of the Mobile
station state information element in the BSSAP+-MS-INFORMATION-RESPONSE
message shall be set to \'Information requested not supported\'.

If the information is not locally available and it is a request for
mobile identity information, the SGSN forwards the IDENTITY REQUEST
message to the MS indicated in the message unless the GPRS activities of
the MS are suspended. Upon receipt of the IDENTITY RESPONSE message from
the MS, the SGSN shall send a BSSAP+-MS-INFORMATION-RESPONSE message.
The BSSAP+-MS-INFORMATION-RESPONSE message contains the information
parameters as requested by the VLR. If the GPRS activities of the MS are
suspended the SGSN shall return a BSSAP+-MS-INFORMATION-RESPONSE message
indicating in the Mobile station state IE \'SUSPENDED\'. If the
requested information is not available or obtainable at the SGSN, the
SGSN shall return a BSSAP+-MS-INFORMATION-RESPONSE message to the VLR
without the requested information. The SGSN should include the Mobile
station state IE in all BSSAP+-MS-INFORMATION-RESPONSE messages.

If the IMSI is not known at the SGSN, the SGSN shall return a
BSSAP+-MS-INFORMATION-RESPONSE message indicating in the Mobile station
state IE \'IMSI unknown\'.

15 MM information procedure
===========================

15.1 General description
------------------------

The MM information procedure may be performed by the VLR via GPRS if the
target MS for the MM information procedure is IMSI attached to both GPRS
and non-GPRS services (i.e. the state of the association is
Gs-ASSOCIATED). The outcome of the MM Information procedure does not
change the state of the association at the VLR or SGSN.

15.2 Procedures in the VLR
--------------------------

If the target MS for the MM information procedure is GPRS attached class
A or B MS, the state of the association is Gs-ASSOCIATED, the VLR may
initiate the MM information procedure by transferring a
BSSAP+-MM-INFORMATION-REQUEST message to the SGSN.

15.3 Procedures in the SGSN
---------------------------

If the state of the association at the SGSN is not Gs-NULL, and the
network only spans one time zone, the SGSN shall keep the information
elements in the MM information unchanged.

NOTE: For the determination of the number of time zones, both CS and PS
domain are taken into account.

If the network spans more than one time zone, the SGSN shall check and
update the contents of the MM information information element as
follows:

\- if Network Daylight Saving Time has been included in the MM
information, then the SGSN shall discard the Network Daylight Saving
Time;

\- if Local Time Zone has been included in the MM information, then the
SGSN shall replace the Local Time Zone with the Local Time Zone
applicable for this MS. In addition, if the local time zone in the SGSN
has been adjusted for daylight saving time, the SGSN shall indicate this
by including the value used for adjustment in Network Daylight Saving
Time IE in the MM information;

\- if Universal time and local time zone has been included in the MM
information, then the SGSN shall replace it with the Universal time and
local time zone applicable for this MS. In addition, if the local time
zone in the SGSN has been adjusted for daylight saving time, the SGSN
shall indicate this by including the value used for adjustment in
Network Daylight Saving Time IE in the MM information; and

-   other information elements in the MM information are kept unchanged.

The SGSN shall then send the resultant MM-INFORMATION message to the MS
indicated.

16 Error Handling and Future Compatibility
==========================================

16.1 General
------------

This clause specifies procedures for the handling of unknown,
unforeseen, and erroneous protocol data by the receiving entity. These
procedures are called \"error handling procedures\", but in addition to
providing recovery mechanisms for error situations they define a
compatibility mechanism for future extensions of the protocol.

In this clause the following terminology is used:

\- an IE is defined to be syntactically incorrect in a message if it
contains at least one value defined as \"reserved\", or if its value
part violates coding rules. However, it is not a syntactical error that
an IE specifies in its Length Indicator a greater length than defined in
the relevant clause; and

\- a message is defined to have semantically incorrect contents if it
contains information which, possibly dependant on the state of the
receiver, is in contradiction to the resources of the receiver and/or to
the procedural part of 3GPP TS 29.018.

When a receiving entity detects the need to send a BSSAP+-MOBILE-STATUS
message (see errors detailed below), the entity shall copy the IMSI IE
value (if included) of the incorrect message to the IMSI IE on the
BSSAP+-MOBILE-STATUS message. The message in error is also included in
the BSSAP+-MOBILE-STATUS message. Both the receiving and the sending
entity shall abandon the procedure related to the incorrect message and
return to the state from where the procedure related to the incorrect
message was started.

A BSSAP+-MOBILE-STATUS message shall not be sent in response to a
received BSSAP+-MOBILE-STATUS message.

Both the receiving and the sending entity shall inform the O&M entity
upon sending or receiving a BSSAP+-MOBILE-STATUS message.

The next clauses in this clause shall be applied in order of precedence.

16.2 Message too short
----------------------

When a message is received that is too short to contain a complete
message type information element, that message shall be ignored.

16.3 Unknown or unforeseen message type
---------------------------------------

If a message is received with a message type not defined or not
implemented by the receiver it shall ignore the message. A
BSSAP+-MOBILE-STATUS message with the Gs Cause Value set to \"message
unknown\" and the Erroneous message IE containing the received message
shall be returned.

If a message is received that is not compatible with the protocol state,
a BSSAP+-MOBILE-STATUS message with the Gs Cause Value set to \"message
not compatible with the protocol state\" and the erroneous message shall
be returned.

If a message is received that is not defined to be received by that
entity (i.e. the message is sent in the wrong direction) it shall be
treated as unknown message and the message shall be ignored. A
BSSAP+-MOBILE-STATUS message with the Gs Cause Value set to \"message
unknown\" and the Erroneous message IE containing the received message
shall be returned.

16.4 Missing mandatory information element
------------------------------------------

When on receipt of a message, and a \"missing mandatory IE\" error is
diagnosed, the receiver shall ignore the message and return a
BSSAP+-MOBILE-STATUS message with the Gs Cause Value set to \"missing
mandatory information element\" and shall return the Erroneous message
information element containing the received message.

16.5 IEs unknown or unforeseen in the message
---------------------------------------------

All IEs unknown or unforeseen in a message shall be ignored.

16.6 Out of sequence IEs
------------------------

All IEs that are out of sequence shall be ignored.

16.7 Repeated IEs
-----------------

If an information element with format T, TV, or TLV is repeated in a
message in which repetition of the information element is not specified,
only the contents of the information element appearing first shall be
handled and all subsequent repetitions of the information element shall
be ignored. When repetition of information elements is specified, only
the contents of specified repeated information elements shall be
handled. If the limit on repetition of information elements is exceeded,
the contents of information elements appearing first up to the limit of
repetitions shall be handled and all subsequent repetitions of the
information element shall be ignored.

16.8 Syntactically incorrect mandatory IE.
------------------------------------------

On receipt of a message which contains a syntactically incorrect
mandatory IE, the receiver shall ignore the message and return a
BSSAP+-MOBILE-STATUS message with the Gs Cause Value set to \"invalid
mandatory information\" and shall return the Erroneous message
information element containing the received message.

16.9 Syntactically incorrect optional IEs
-----------------------------------------

All optional IEs that are syntactically incorrect in a message shall be
treated as not present in the message.

16.10 Conditional IE errors
---------------------------

When a VLR or SGSN receives a message and diagnoses a \"missing
conditional IE\" error or an \"unexpected conditional IE\" error or when
it receives a message containing at least one syntactically incorrect
conditional IE which is required to be present in the message, a VLR or
SGSN shall ignore the message and return a BSSAP+-MOBILE-STATUS message
with the Gs Cause Value set to \"conditional IE error\" and shall return
the Erroneous message information element containing the received
message.

When a VLR or SGSN receives a message containing a syntactically
incorrect conditional IE which is not required to be present in the
message, nor required to be absent in the message, then a VLR or SGSN
shall ignore that IE.

16.11 IEs with semantically incorrect contents
----------------------------------------------

When an IE with semantically incorrect contents is received, the
foreseen reactions of the procedural part of 3GPP TS 29.018 are
performed.

If however no such reactions are specified, the receiving entity shall
ignore that IE and treat the rest of the message. If, because this IE
was ignored, the rest of the message can no longer be handled then the
receiving entity shall return a BSSAP+-MOBILE-STATUS message with the Gs
Cause Value set to \"semantically incorrect message\" and shall return
the Erroneous message information element containing the received
message.

#### 17.1.9.1 New TMSI, or IMSI

This information element represents the identity to be used for (and
then by) the MS.

If this information element is an IMSI, then the mobile station is not
allocated any TMSI (and deletes any TMSI accordingly). If this
information element is a TMSI, then the mobile station will use this
TMSI as the new temporary identity (the MS deletes its old TMSI if
available, and stores the new TMSI). If neither a TMSI nor an IMSI are
included in this information element, the old TMSI, if any available,
will be kept.

20 Procedures for Tunnelling Non-GSM Signalling
===============================================

This procedure is used to tunnel non-GSM signalling messages between an
MS and a non-GSM MSC/VLR.

20.1 Procedures in the non-GSM MSC/VLR
--------------------------------------

When the non-GSM MSC/VLR has a message to be tunnelled to an MS, whose
Gs state is not Gs-NULL, it shall send a BSSAP+-DOWNLINK-TUNNEL-REQUEST
message to the SGSN associated with the MS. If LLC ciphering is
required, the cipher request field E shall be set to 1. The Tunnel
Priority field for the payload shall be set as required. On receiving a
BSSAP+-UPLINK-TUNNEL-REQUEST message from an SGSN, the action taken by
the non-GSM MSC/VLR is technology dependent.

20.2 Procedures in the SGSN
---------------------------

A message received by the SGSN from an MS or sent by the SGSN to an MS
on one of the Tunneling of Messages (TOM) LLC SAPs is called a *TOM
Protocol Envelope* (see 3GPP TS 44.064 \[12\]). The *TOM Protocol
Envelope* is composed of the *TOM Protocol Header* immediately followed
by a *Message Capsule*.

Upon receipt of a *TOM Protocol Envelope* with a *TOM Protocol Header*
indicating the presence of one or more non-GSM signalling messages, the
SGSN shall determine the non-GSM MSC/VLR to which the *Message Capsule*
in the *TOM Protocol Envelope* shall be forwarded. The SGSN shall make
this determination based upon the RAI of the MS, the *TOM Protocol
Discriminator* field in the *TOM Protocol Header*, and *TOM Protocol
Discriminator* specific information in the remaining octets (if any) in
the *TOM Protocol Header*. The SGSN shall then forward a
BSSAP+-UPLINK-TUNNEL-REQUEST message to the selected non-GSM MSC/VLR
with the received *Message Capsule* in the *Tunnel Payload* field. The
*Protocol Discriminator* field in the BSSAP+-UPLINK-TUNNEL-REQUEST
message shall be set based on the *TOM Protocol Discriminator* in the
*TOM Protocol Envelope*. *Tunnel Priority* field in the
BSSAP+-UPLINK-TUNNEL-REQUEST message shall be set based on the LLC SAP
on which the *TOM Protocol Envelope* was received. The *E* field shall
be set to 1 if the *TOM Protocol Envelope* was received by the LLC in
ciphered form, otherwise it shall be set to 0.

Upon receipt of a BSSAP+-DOWNLINK-TUNNEL-REQUEST message from a non-GSM
MSC/VLR, the SGSN shall construct a *TOM Protocol Envelope* by mapping
the *Tunnel Payload* field to the *Message Capsule* portion of the *TOM
Protocol Envelope*. The *TOM Protocol Header* shall be constructed based
on the *Protocol Discriminator* in the BSSAP+-DOWNLINK-TUNNEL-REQUEST
message. The SGSN shall then send the *TOM Protocol Envelope* to the MS
on a specific LLC SAP. That LLC SAP shall be determined by the *Tunnel
Priority* field in the BSSAP+-DOWNLINK-TUNNEL-REQUEST message. LLC
ciphering shall be enabled or disabled based upon the value of the *E*
field in this message. If the SGSN is unable to send the *TOM Protocol
Envelope* to the indicated MS for any reason, including the inability to
accommodate the ciphering request as indicated in the
BSSAP+-DOWNLINK-TUNNEL-REQUEST message, then it shall send a
BSSAP+-MOBILE-STATUS message to the non-GSM MSC/VLR with an appropriate
*Gs Cause* code.

The association between the LLC SAPs and the *Tunnel Priority* shall be
as in the following table, where 00 is top-most priority and 11 is
lowest priority.
