 Foreword
========

This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:

**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something

**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something

The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the
context of normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.

The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes
for \"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as
possible, and they are not used in a normative context except in a
direct citation from an external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so
as to maintain continuity of style when extending or modifying the
provisions of such a referenced document.

**should** indicates a recommendation to do something

**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something

**may** indicates permission to do something

**need not** indicates permission not to do something

The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\"
are used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.

**can** indicates that something is possible

**cannot** indicates that something is impossible

The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\"
and \"need not\".

**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a
result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to
happen as a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which
is outside the scope of the present document

**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result
of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document

**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside
the scope of the present document

In addition:

**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement
of fact

**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates
a statement of fact

The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

1 Scope

#### 5.2.2.2 UE Context Operations

##### 5.2.2.2.1 UEContextTransfer

###### 5.2.2.2.1.1 General

The UEContextTransfer service operation is used during the following
procedure:

\- General Registration procedure (see 3GPP TS 23.502 \[3\], clause
4.2.2.2.2)

The UEContextTransfer service operation is invoked by a NF Service
Consumer, e.g. a target AMF, towards the AMF (acting as source AMF),
when the target AMF receives a Registration Request with the UE\'s
5G-GUTI included and the serving AMF has changed since last
registration, to retrieve the UE Context, e.g. the UE\'s SUPI and MM
Context, in the source AMF.

The NF Service Consumer (e.g. the target AMF) shall retrieve the UE
Context by invoking the \"transfer\" custom method on the URI of an
\"Individual ueContext\" resource identified by UE\'s 5G-GUTI, see
clause 6.1.3.2.4. See also Figure 5.2.2.2.1.1-1.

Figure 5.2.2.2.1.1-1 UE Context Transfer

1\. The NF Service Consumer, e.g. target AMF, shall send a HTTP POST
request to invoke \"transfer\" custom method on an \"Individual
ueContext\" resource URI. The payload of the request shall be an object
of \"UeContextTranferReqData\" data type.

If UE Context Transfer is triggered by UE initial registration or
mobility registration, the NF Service Consumer, e.g. target AMF, shall
set the reason attribute to \"INIT\_REG\" or \"MOBI\_REG\" and include
the integrity protected registration request message which triggers the
UE context transfer in the payload.

2a. On success:

\- if the reason attribute is \"INIT\_REG\" and integrity check is
successful, the (source) AMF shall respond with the status code \"200
OK\". The payload of the response shall be an object of
\"UeContextTransferRspData\" data type, containing:

case a) the representation of the requested UE Context as follows:

\- without PDU Session Contexts associated to the access type indicated
in the request by the NF Service Consumer (e.g. target AMF); and

\- with PDU Session Contexts associated to the other access type, if the
UE is registered for the other access type in the (source) AMF, unless
the source AMF determines based on the PLMN ID of the (target) AMF that
there is no possibility for relocating the N2 interface for non-3GPP
access to the (target) AMF;

or

case b) the representation of the requested UE Context only containing
the \"supi\" attribute, if the UE is registered in a different access
type in the (source) AMF and the source AMF determines based on the PLMN
ID of the (target) AMF that there is no possibility for relocating the
N2 interface to the (target) AMF.

\- If the reason attribute is \"MOBI\_REG\" and integrity check is
successful, the (source) AMF shall respond with the status code \"200
OK\". The payload of the response shall be an object of
\"UeContextTransferRspData\" data type, containing:

a\) the representation of the complete UE Context including available MM
and PDU Session Contexts; or

b\) the representation of the requested UE Context including the
available MM and PDU Session Contexts for the 3GPP access type, if the
UE is registered for both 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses in the (source) AMF
and the source AMF determines based on the PLMN ID of the (target) AMF
that there is no possibility for relocating the N2 interface for
non-3GPP access to the (target) AMF.

NOTE: The source AMF can determine that it is not possible to relocate
the N2 interface to the target AMF when both AMFs pertain to different
PLMNs. The UE context shall contain trace control and configuration
parameters, if signalling based trace has been activated (see
3GPP TS 32.422 \[30\]).\
\
The NF Service Consumer, e.g. target AMF, starts tracing according to
the received trace control and configuration parameters, if trace data
is received in the UE context indicating that signalling based trace has
been activated. Once the NF Service Consumer receives subscription data,
trace requirements received from the UDM supersedes the trace
requirements received from the AMF.

The UE context shall contain event subscriptions information in the
following cases:

a\) Any NF Service Consumer has subscribed for UE specific event; and/or

b\) Any NF Service Consumer has subscribed for UE group specific events
to which the UE belongs. In this case the event subscriptions provided
in the UE context shall contain the event details applicable to this
specific UE in the group (e.g maxReports in options IE).

The NF Service Consumer, e.g. target AMF, shall:

\- in case a) create event subscriptions for the UE specific events;

\- in case b) create event subscriptions for the group Id if there are
no existing event subscriptions for that group Id, subscription change
notification URI (subsChangeNotifyUri) and the subscription change
notification correlation Id (subsChangeNotifyCorrelationId). If there is
already an existing event subscription for the group Id, and for the
given subscription change notification URI (subsChangeNotifyUri) and
subscription change notification correlation Id
(subsChangeNotifyCorrelationId), then an event subscription shall not be
created at the NF Service Consumer. The individual UE specific event
details (e.g maxReports in options IE) within that group shall be taken
into account.

\- for both the cases, for each created event subscription, allocate a
new subscription Id, if necessary (see clause 6.5.2 of
3GPP TS 29.500 \[4\]), and if allocated, send the new subscription Id to
the notification endpoint for informing the subscription Id creation,
along with the notification correlation Id for the subscription Id
change. If the UEContextTransfer service operation is performed towards
the old AMF as part of the EPS to 5GS mobility registration procedure
using N26 interface (see clause 4.11.1.3.3 of 3GPP TS 23.502 \[3\]), the
target AMF may also initiate event subscription synchronization
procedure with UDM, as specified in clause 5.3.2.4.2, when both the
target AMF and the UDM support the \"ESSYNC\" feature.

NOTE: Subscription Id can be reused if the mobility is between AMFs of
same AMF Set.

If the UE context being transferred from the source AMF is the last UE
context that belongs to a UE group Id related subscription, then the
source AMF shall not delete the UE group Id related subscription until
the expiry of that event subscription (see clause 5.3.2.2.2).

The source AMF shall not transfer those PDU sessions which are not
supported by the target AMF, e.g. the MA-PDU sessions shall not be
transferred if the target AMF does not support ATSSS.

2b. On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in
Table 6.1.3.2.4.4.2-2 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the
message body shall contain a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\"
attribute set to one of the application errors listed in Table
6.1.3.2.4.4.2-2.

###### 5.2.2.2.1.2 Retrieve UE Context after successful UE authentication

When a successful UE authentication has been performed after a previous
integrity check failure, the NF service consumer (e.g. the target AMF)
shall retrieve the UE context by invoking \"transfer\" service operation
on the URI of the \"Individual ueContext\" resource identified by UE\'s
SUPI. The same requirements in clause 5.2.2.2.1.1 shall be applied with
following modifications:

1\. Same as step 1 of figure 5.2.2.2.1.1-1, with following differences:

\- The {ueContextId} in the URI shall be composed using UE\'s SUPI, and

\- The \"reason\" attribute in request body shall be set to
\"MOBI\_REG\_UE\_VALIDATED\", and

\- The request body shall not include registration request message from
UE.

2\. Same as step 2a of figure 5.2.2.2.1.1-1, with following differences:

\- The (source) AMF shall skip integrity check and shall respond with
the status code \"200 OK \"with the UE Context excluding SeafData and
including available PDU Session Contexts

##### 5.2.2.2.2 RegistrationStatusUpdate

###### 5.2.2.2.2.1 General

The RegistrationStatusUpdate service operation is used during the
following procedure:

\- General Registration procedure (see 3GPP TS 23.502 \[3\], clause
4.2.2.2.2)

\- Registration with AMF re-allocation procedure (see
3GPP TS 23.502 \[3\], clause 4.2.2.2.3)

The RegistrationStatusUpdate service operation is invoked by a NF
Service Consumer, e.g. the target AMF, towards the NF Service Producer,
i.e. the source AMF, to update the status of UE registration at the
target AMF, thereby indicating the result of previous UE Context
transfer for a given UE (see clause 5.2.2.2.1.1).

The target AMF shall update the NF Service Producer (i.e. source AMF)
with the status of the UE registration at the target AMF due to a
previous UE Context transfer. The NF Service Consumer (e.g. target AMF)
shall use the HTTP method POST to invoke the \"transfer-update\" custom
operation on the URI of an \"Individual ueContext\" resource, see clause
6.1.3.2.4. See also Figure 5.2.2.2.2.1-1.

>
> Once the update is received, the source AMF shall:

\- remove the individual ueContext resource and release any PDU
session(s) in the toReleaseSessionList attribute, if the transferStatus
attribute included in the POST request body is set to \"TRANSFERRED\"
and if the source AMF transferred the complete UE Context including all
MM contexts and PDU Session Contexts. The source AMF may choose to start
a timer to supervise the release of the UE context resource and may keep
the individual ueContext resource until the timer expires. If the
pcfReselectedInd is set to true, the source AMF shall terminate the AM
Policy Association and/or the UE Policy Association that the source AMF
has to the old PCF.

\- keep the UE context only including the MM context and PDU session(s)
associated to the non-3GPP access, if the transferStatus attribute
included in the POST request body is set to \" TRANSFERRED\" and if the
source AMF did not transfer the MM context and PDU Session Contexts for
the non-3GPP access type; the AMF shall release any PDU session(s) in
the toReleaseSessionList attribute. The source AMF may choose to start a
timer and keep the MM context and PDU session(s) associated to the 3GPP
access until the timer expires.

\- keep the UE Context as if the context transfer procedure had not
happened if the transferStatus attribute included in the POST request
body is set to \"NOT\_TRANSFERRED\".

2a. On Success: The source AMF shall respond with the status code \"200
OK\" if the request is accepted. If the smfChangeInfoList attribute was
received in the request, the source AMF shall release the SM context at
the I-SMF or V-SMF only, for all the PDU sessions listed in the
smfChangeInfoList attribute with the smfChangeIndication attribute set
to \"CHANGED\" or \"REMOVED\".

If some PDU sessions are not supported by the target AMF and thus not
transferred to the target AMF, the source AMF shall release these PDU
sessions after this step.

2b. On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in
Table 6.1.3.2.4.5.2-2 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the
message body shall contain a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\"
attribute set to one of the application errors listed in Table
6.1.3.2.4.5.2-2, where applicable.

##### 5.2.2.2.3 CreateUEContext

###### 5.2.2.2.3.1 General

The CreateUEContext service operation is used during the following
procedure:

\- Inter NG-RAN node N2 based handover (see 3GPP TS 23.502 \[3\], clause
4.9.1.3, and clause 4.23.7)

\- 5G-SRVCC procedure from NG-RAN to UTRAN (see 3GPP TS 23.216 \[39\],
clause 6.5)

The CreateUEContext service operation is invoked by a NF Service
Consumer, e.g. a source AMF, towards the AMF (acting as target AMF),
when the source AMF *can\'t serve the UE and selects the target AMF
during the handover procedure*, to create the UE Context in the target
AMF.

The NF Service Consumer (e.g. the source AMF) shall create the UE
Context by using the HTTP PUT method with the URI of the \"Individual
UeContext\" resource (See clause 6.1.3.2.3.1). See also Figure
5.2.2.2.3.1-1.

Figure 5.2.2.2.3.1-1 Create UE Context

1\. The NF Service Consumer, e.g. source AMF, shall send a PUT request,
to create the ueContext in the target AMF. The payload body of the PUT
request shall contain a UeContextCreateData structure, including a N2
Information Notification callback URI.

The UE context shall contain trace control and configuration parameters,
if signalling based trace has been activated (see
3GPP TS 32.422 \[30\]).

For 5G-SRVCC procedure from NG-RAN to UTRAN, the NF Service Consumer
(i.e. AMF) carries the Mobile Station Classmark 2, STN-SR, C-MSISDN and
Supported Codec List in the request, as specified in
3GPP TS 23.502 \[3\].

2a. On success, the target AMF shall respond with the status code \"201
Created\" if the request is accepted, together with a HTTP Location
header to provide the location of a newly created resource. The payload
body of the PUT response shall contain the representation of the created
UE Context. If the target AMF selects a new PCF for AM Policy other than
the one which was included in the UeContext by the old AMF, the target
AMF shall set pcfReselectedInd to true. If the pcfReselectedInd is set
to true, the source AMF shall terminate the AM Policy Association to the
old PCF.

The target AMF starts tracing according to the received trace control
and configuration parameters, if trace data is received in the UE
context indicating that signalling based trace has been activated. Once
the AMF receives subscription data, trace requirements received from the
UDM supersedes the trace requirements received from the NF Service
Consumer.

The UE context shall contain event subscriptions information in the
following cases:

a\) Any NF Service Consumer has subscribed for UE specific event; and/or

b\) Any NF Service Consumer has subscribed for UE group specific events
to which the UE belongs. In this case the event subscriptions provided
in the UE context shall contain the event details applicable to this
specific UE in the group (e.g maxReports in options IE).

The target AMF shall:

\- in case a) create event subscriptions for the UE specific events;

\- in case b) create event subscriptions for the group Id if there are
no existing event subscriptions for that group Id, subscription change
notification URI (subsChangeNotifyUri) and the subscription change
notification correlation Id (subsChangeNotifyCorrelationId). If there is
already an existing event subscription for the group Id and for the
given subscription change notification URI (subsChangeNotifyUri) and
subscription Id change notification correlation Id
(subsChangeNotifyCorrelationId), then an event subscription shall not be
created at the target AMF. The individual UE specific event details (e.g
maxReports in options IE) within that group shall be taken into account.

\- for both the cases, for each created event subscription, allocate a
new subscription Id, if necessary (see clause 6.5.2 of
3GPP TS 29.500 \[4\]), and if allocated send the new subscription Id to
the notification endpoint for informing the subscription Id creation,
along with the notification correlation Id for the subscription Id
change.

NOTE: Subscription Id can be reused if the mobility is between AMFs of
same AMF Set.

If the UE context being transferred from the NF service consumer (e.g.
source AMF) is the last UE context that belongs to a UE group Id related
subscription, then the NF service consumer (e.g. source AMF) shall not
delete the UE group Id related subscription until the expiry of that
event subscription (see clause 5.3.2.2.2).

The source AMF, shall:

\- release those PDU sessions not supported by the target AMF and thus
not transferred to the target AMF.

2b. On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in
Table 6.1.3.2.3.1-3 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the
message body shall contain a UeContextCreateError structure, including:

\- a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to one of
the application errors listed in Table 6.1.3.2.3.1-3. The cause in the
error attribute shall be set to HANDOVER\_FAILURE, if all of the PDU
sessions are failed, e.g. no response from the SMF within a maximum wait
timer;

\- NgAPCause, if available;

\- N2 information carrying the Target to Source Failure Transparent
Container, if this information has been received from the target NG-RAN
and if the source AMF supports the NPN feature.

##### 5.2.2.2.4 ReleaseUEContext

###### 5.2.2.2.4.1 General

The ReleaseUEContext service operation is used during the following
procedure:

\- Inter NG-RAN node N2 based handover, Cancel procedure (see
3GPP TS 23.502 \[3\], clause 4.9.1.4)

The ReleaseUEContext service operation is invoked by a NF Service
Consumer, e.g. a source AMF, towards the AMF (acting as target AMF),
when the source AMF *receives the Handover Cancel from the 5G-AN during
the handover procedure*, to release the UE Context in the target AMF.

The NF Service Consumer (e.g. the source AMF) shall release the UE
Context by using the HTTP \"release\" custom operation with the URI of
the \"Individual UeContext\" resource (See clause 6.1.3.2.4.2). See also
Figure 5.2.2.2.4.1-1.

Figure 5.2.2.2.4.1-1 Release UE Context

1\. The NF Service Consumer, e.g. source AMF, shall send a POST request,
to release the ueContext in the target AMF. The payload body of the POST
request shall contain any data that needs to be passed to the target
AMF.

2a. On success, the target AMF shall return \"204 No Content\" with an
empty payload body in the POST response.

2b. On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in
Table 6.1.3.2.4.2.2-2 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the
message body shall contain a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\"
attribute set to one of the application error listed in Table
6.1.3.2.4.2.2-2.

##### 5.2.2.2.5 RelocateUEContext

###### 5.2.2.2.5.1 General {#general-4 .Style-Heading-6-+-Left:--0-cm-First-line:--0-cm}

The RelocateUEContext service operation is used during the following
procedure:

\- EPS to 5GS handover using N26 interface with AMF re-allocation (see
3GPP TS 23.502 \[3\], clause 4.11.1.2.2).

The RelocateUEContext service operation is invoked by a NF Service
Consumer, e.g. an initial AMF, towards the AMF (acting as target AMF),
during an EPS to 5GS handover with AMF re-allocation, to relocate the UE
Context in the target AMF.

The NF Service Consumer (e.g. the initial AMF) shall relocate the UE
Context in the target AMF by invoking the \"relocate\" custom method on
the URI of an \"Individual ueContext\" resource (see clause 6.1.3.2.4).
See also Figure 5.2.2.2.5.1-1.

Figure 5.2.2.2.5.1-1 Relocate UE Context

1\. The NF Service Consumer, e.g. initial AMF, shall send a POST request
to relocate the UE context in the target AMF. The payload body of the
POST request shall contain a UeContextRelocateData structure.

The UE context shall contain trace control and configuration parameters,
if signalling based trace has been activated (see
3GPP TS 32.422 \[30\]).

For an EPS to 5GS handover procedure, the NF Service Consumer shall
carry per PDU session the S-NSSAI for serving PLMN, the MME Control
Plane Address and the TEID in the request. If S-NSSAI for interworking
is configured and used in initial AMF for the PDU session, the initial
AMF shall also carry the configured S-NSSAI for interworking to the
target AMF, as specified in clause 4.11.1.2.2 of 3GPP TS 23.502 \[3\].
In Home Routed roaming case, the S-NSSAI for serving PLMN is derived by
the initial AMF based on the S-NSSAI for home PLMN retrieved from
SMF+PGW-C, as specified in 3GPP TS 23.502 \[3\].

2a. On success, the target AMF shall respond with the status code \"201
Created\" if the request is accepted, together with a HTTP Location
header to provide the location of the newly created resource. The
payload body of the POST response shall contain the representation of
the created UE Context.

The target AMF starts tracing according to the received trace control
and configuration parameters, if trace data is received in the UE
context indicating that signalling based trace has been activated. Once
the AMF receives subscription data, trace requirements received from the
UDM supersedes the trace requirements received from the NF Service
Consumer.

2b. On failure to relocate the UE context or redirection, one of the
HTTP status code listed in Table 6.1.3.2.4.6.2-2 shall be returned. For
a 4xx/5xx response, the message body shall contain a ProblemDetails
structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to one of the application
errors listed in Table 6.1.3.2.4.6.2-2.

If the target RAN rejects the Handover Request, the target AMF shall
send the Forward Relocation Response message directly to the source MME
over the N26 interface, carrying the appropriate cause value.

##### 5.2.2.2.6 CancelRelocateUEContext

###### 5.2.2.2.6.1 General

The CancelRelocateUEContext service operation is used during the
following procedure:

\- EPS to 5GS Handover with AMF re-allocation, Handover Cancel procedure
(see 3GPP TS 23.502 \[3\], clause 4.11.1.2.3)

The CancelRelocateUEContext service operation is invoked by a NF Service
Consumer (i.e. initial AMF), towards the AMF (acting as target AMF),
when the initial AMF *receives Forward Cancel Request from the source
MME during EPS to 5GS Handover with AMF re-allocation porceudre, to
trigger the target AMF to release* the UE Context.

The NF Service Consumer (i.e. the initial AMF) shall cancel the UE
Context Relocation by using the HTTP \"cancel-relocate\" custom
operation with the URI of the \"Individual UeContext\" resource (See
clause 6.1.3.2.4.2). See also Figure 5.2.2.2.6.1-1.

Figure 5.2.2.2.6.1-1 Cancel Relocate UE Context

1\. The NF Service Consumer, i.e. initial AMF, shall send a POST
request, to release the ueContext in the target AMF. The payload body of
the POST request shall contain the UeContextCancelRelocateData that
needs to be passed to the target AMF.

2a. On success, the target AMF shall return \"204 No Content\" with an
empty payload body in the POST response.

2b. On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in
Table 6.1.3.2.4.7.2-2 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the
message body shall contain a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\"
attribute set to one of the application error listed in Table
6.1.3.2.4.7.2-2.

###### 5.2.2.3.1.2 Detailed behaviour of the AMF

When an NF service consumer is requesting to send N1 and/or N2
information and the UE is in CM-IDLE state for the access type for which
the N1 and/or N2 information is related (called \"associated access
type\" hereafter in this clause), the requirements specified in clause
5.2.2.3.1.1 shall apply with the following modifications:

NOTE: N1 and/or N2 Session Management information is related to the
access type of the targeted PDU session for a single access PDU session,
or to the Target Access received in the request for a MA PDU session;
LCS related N2 (NRPPa) information is related to 3GPP access in this
release of specification.

4xx and 5xx response cases shall also apply to UEs in CM-CONNECTED
state, when applicable.

**2xx Response Cases:**

**Case A: When UE is CM-IDLE in 3GPP access and the associated access
type is 3GPP access:**

a\) Same as step 2a of Figure 5.2.2.3.1.1-1, the AMF should respond with
the status code \"200 OK\", if \"skipInd\" attribute is set to \"true\"
in the request body, with a response body that carries the cause
\"N1\_MSG\_NOT\_TRANSFERRED\".

b\) Same as step 2a of Figure 5.2.2.3.1.1-1, the AMF shall respond with
the status code \"202 Accepted\", if the asynchronous type communication
is invoked and hence the UE is not paged, update the UE context and
store N1 and/or N2 information and initiate communication with the UE
and/or 5G-AN when the UE becomes reachable. In this case the AMF shall
provide the URI of the resource in the AMF in the \"Location\" header of
the response, which contains information regarding the stored N1/N2
message. The AMF shall also provide a response body containing the
cause, \"WAITING\_FOR\_ASYNCHRONOUS\_TRANSFER\" that represents the
current status of the N1/N2 message transfer;

c\) Same as step 2a of Figure 5.2.2.3.1.1-1, the AMF shall respond with
the status code \"202 Accepted\", if paging is issued when the UE is in
CM-IDLE and reachable for 3GPP access, with a response body that carries
a cause \"ATTEMPTING\_TO\_REACH\_UE\" as specified in clause 4.2.3.3 and
5.2.2.2.7 of 3GPP TS 23.502 \[3\].

**Case B: When UE is CM-IDLE in Non-3GPP access but CM-CONNECTED in 3GPP
access and the associated access type is Non-3GPP access:**

a\) Same as step 2a of Figure 5.2.2.3.1.1-1, the AMF shall respond with
the status code \"200 OK\" with cause \"N1\_N2\_TRANSFER\_INITIATED\"
and initiate N1 NAS SM message transfer via 3GPP access, if the NF
service consumer (i.e. SMF) requests to send only N1 NAS SM message
without any associated N2 SM information, and the current access type
related to the PDU session is Non-3GPP access and the UE is CM-CONNECTED
in 3GPP access.

b\) Same as step 2a of Figure 5.2.2.3.1.1-1, the AMF shall respond with
the status code \"202 Accepted\", if NAS Notification procedure is
issued when the UE is in CM-CONNECTED in 3GPP access, with a response
body that carries a cause \"ATTEMPTING\_TO\_REACH\_UE\" as specified in
step 4c of clause 4.2.3.3 and 5.2.2.2.7 of 3GPP TS 23.502 \[3\].

**Case C: When UE is CM-IDLE in both Non-3GPP access and 3GPP access and
the associated access type is Non-3GPP access:**

All the bullets specified in Case A are applicable.

The NF Service Consumer shall not send any further signalling for the UE
if it receives a POST response body with a cause
\"ATTEMPTING\_TO\_REACH\_UE\" unless it has higher priority signalling.
In such a case the response shall include the \"Location\" header
containing the URI of the resource created in the AMF, which holds the
status of the N1/N2 message transfer, e.g.
\"\.../n1-n2-messages/{n1N2MessageId}\". The AMF shall:

\- store the N1 and/or N2 information related to 3GPP access and, when
the UE responds with a Service Request, shall initiate communication
with the UE and/or 5G-AN using the stored N1 and/or N2 information;

\- store the N1 NAS SM information related to Non-3GPP access if no N2
information was received and the AMF initiated paging towards the UE.
Later when the UE responds with a Service Request,the AMF shall initiate
communication with the UE using the stored N1 information via 3GPP
access;

\- inform the SMF which invoked the service operation, that the access
type of the PDU Session can be changed from Non-3GPP access to 3GPP
access as specified in clause 5.2.2.3.2.1 of 3GPP TS 29.502 \[16\], when
the UE responds with a \"List Of Allowed PDU Sessions\" and the
indicated non-3GPP PDU session of the N2 (and N1 if received)
information is included in the list; or

\- notify the NF which invoked the service operation, as specified in
clause 5.2.2.3.2, if the Notification URI is provided, when the AMF
determines that the paging or NAS Notification has failed or when the UE
responds with a \"List Of Allowed PDU Sessions\" and the indicated
Non-3GPP PDU session of the N2 (and N1 if received) information is not
included in the list.

**4xx Response Cases:**

\- Same as step 2b of Figure 5.2.2.3.1.1-1, the AMF shall respond with
status code \"409 Conflict\" in the following cases:

\- if the UE is in 3GPP access and there is already an ongoing paging
procedure with higher or same priority, the AMF shall set the
application error as \"HIGHER\_PRIORITY\_REQUEST\_ONGOING\" in the
\"cause\" attribute of the ProblemDetails structure of the POST response
body. The AMF may provide a retry timer value to the NF Service Consumer
in order for the NF Service Consumer to retry the request after the
expiry of the timer. When the retry timer is provided, the NF Service
Consumer shall not initiate the downlink messaging until the timer
expires. The AMF may also provide the ARP value of the QoS flow that has
triggered the currently ongoing highest priority paging, so that the NF
Service Consumer (e.g. SMF) knows that if any subsequent trigger
initiating downlink messaging for a QoS flow with the same or lower
priority happens.

\- if there is an ongoing registration procedure (see clause 4.2.3.3 of
3GPP TS 23.502 \[3\]) the AMF shall set the application error as
\"TEMPORARY\_REJECT\_REGISTRATION\_ONGOING\" in the \"cause\" attribute
of the ProblemDetails structure in the POST response body;

\- if this is a request to transfer a N2 PDU Session Resource Modify
Request or a N2 PDU Session Resource Release Command to a 5G-AN and if
the UE is in CM-IDLE state at the AMF for the Access Network Type
associated to the PDU session (see clauses 4.3.3 and 4.3.4 of
3GPP TS 23.502 \[3\] and clause 5.3.2.1 of 3GPP TS 23.527 \[33\]), the
AMF shall set the application error \"UE\_IN\_CM\_IDLE\_STATE\" in the
\"cause\" attribute of the ProblemDetails structure in the POST response
body.

\- if there is an ongoing Xn or N2 handover procedure (see clause
4.9.1.2.1 and 4.9.1.3.1 of 3GPP TS 23.502 \[3\]) the AMF shall set the
application error as \"TEMPORARY\_REJECT\_HANDOVER\_ONGOING\" in the
\"cause\" attribute of the ProblemDetails structure in the POST response
body, if the AMF rejects the request due to the on-going handover.

\- if the RAT Type is NB-IoT, and the UE already has 2 PDU Sessions with
active user plane resources, the AMF shall set the application error as
\"MAX\_ACTIVE\_SESSIONS\_EXCEEDED\" in POST response body.

\- Same as step 2b of Figure 5.2.2.3.1.1-1, the AMF shall respond with
the status code \"403 Forbidden\", if the UE is in a Non-Allowed Area
and the service request is not for regulatory prioritized service. The
AMF shall set the application error as \"UE\_IN\_NON\_ALLOWED\_AREA\" in
POST response body.

\- Same as step 2b of Figure 5.2.2.3.1.1-1, the AMF shall respond with
the status code \"403 Forbidden \", if the NF service consumer (e.g. an
LMF) is requesting to send N1 LPP message to the UE and the UE has
indicated that it does not support LPP in N1 mode during registration
procedure (see clause 5.5.1.2.2 and 5.5.1.3.2 of 3GPP TS 24.501 \[11\]).
The AMF shall set the application error to
\"UE\_WITHOUT\_N1\_LPP\_SUPPORT\" in POST response body.

**5xx Response Cases:**

\- Same as step 2b of Figure 5.2.2.3.1.1-1, the AMF shall respond with
the status code \"504 Gateway Timeout\", if the UE is currently
unreachable (e.g., due to the UE in MICO mode, the UE using extended
idle mode DRX or the UE is only registered over Non-3GPP access and its
state is CM-IDLE). The AMF shall set the application error as
\"UE\_NOT\_REACHABLE\" in POST response body. If Extended Buffering
Support Indication is received in the request, the AMF shall include the
Estimated Maximum Waiting time in the response body when the message is
rejected due to the UE in MICO mode or the UE using extended idle mode
DRX.

##### 5.2.2.3.2 N1N2Transfer Failure Notification

The AMF uses this notification to inform the NF service consumer that
initiated an earlier Namf\_Communication\_N1N2MessageTransfer, that the
AMF failed to deliver the N1 message to the UE as the UE failed to
respond to paging. The HTTP POST method shall be used on the
notification callback URI provided by the NF service consumer as
specified in clause 5.2.2.3.1.2.

Figure 5.2.2.3.2-1 N1N2Transfer Failure Notification for UE related
signalling

1\. When the AMF determines that the paging or NAS Notification has
failed, or that the indicated non-3GPP PDU session is not allowed to
move to 3GPP access, or that the delivery of the N1 message fails e.g.
in case the UE is in RRC Inactive and NG-RAN paging was not successful
or in case an Xn or N2 handover is being triggered at the NG-RAN, and if
the NF service consumer had provided a notification URI (see clause
5.2.2.3.1.2), the AMF shall send a POST request to the NF Service
Consumer on that Notification URI. The AMF shall include the
N1N2MessageTransfer request resource URI returned earlier in the
N1N2MessageTransfer response if any (see clause 5.2.2.3.1.2), otherwise
a dummy URI (see clause 6.1.6.2.30), in the POST request body. The AMF
shall also include a N1/N2 message transfer cause information in the
POST request body and set the value as specified in clause 6.1.5.6.3.1.

The NF Service Consumer shall delete any stored representation of the
N1N2MessageTransfer request resource URI upon receiving this
notification.

2\. The NF Service Consumer shall send a response with \"204 No
Content\" status code.

On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status codes together with
the response body listed Table 6.1.5.6.3.1-2 shall be returned.

##### 5.2.2.3.3 N1N2MessageSubscribe

###### 5.2.2.3.3.1 General

The N1N2MessageSubscribe service operation is used by a NF Service
Consumer (e.g. PCF) to subscribe to the AMF for notifying N1 messages of
a specific type (e.g. UPDP) or N2 information of a specific type. For
the N1 message class UPDP, a PCF shall subscribe for the N1 message
notification with the AMF to receive the N1 messages from UE that are
related to UE Policy.

NOTE: Step 0 of clause 4.2.4.3 of 3GPP TS 23.502 \[3\] specifies that
the PCF can split the UPDP transfer towards UE into multiple units. One
UE specific callback URI is registered with the AMF by the PCF for the
AMF to notify all UPDP message responses from the UE to the same
callback URI. As a result, an explicit subscription per UE policy
association is defined in stage 3 for this purpose.

An NF Service Consumer (e.g. PCF) may subscribe to notifications of
specific N1 message type (e.g. LPP or UPDP) or N2 information type. In
this case the NF Service Consumer shall subscribe by using the HTTP POST
method with the URI of the \"N1N2 Subscriptions Collection for
Individual UE Contexts\" resource (See clause 6.1.3.3). See also Figure
5.2.2.3.3.1-1.

Figure 5.2.2.3.3.1-1 N1N2 Message Subscribe

1\. The NF Service Consumer shall send a POST request to create a
subscription resource in the AMF for a UE specific N1/N2 message
notification. The payload body of the POST request shall contain:

\- N1 and/or N2 Message Type, identifying the type of N1 and/or N2
message to be notified

\- A callback URI for the notification

2\. If the request is accepted, the AMF shall include a HTTP Location
header to provide the location of a newly created resource
(subscription) together with the status code 201 indicating the
requested resource is created in the response message.

On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status codes together with
the response body listed Table 6.1.3.3.3.1-3 shall be returned.

##### 5.2.2.3.4 N1N2MessageUnSubscribe

###### 5.2.2.3.4.1 General

The N1N2MessageUnSubscribe service operation is used by a NF Service
Consumer (e.g. PCF) to unsubscribe to the AMF to stop notifying N1
messages of a specific type (e.g. LPP or UPDP).

The NF Service Consumer shall use the HTTP method DELETE with the URI of
the \"N1N2 Individual Subscription\" resource (See clause 6.1.3.7.3.1),
to request the deletion of the subscription for the N1 / N2 message
towards the AMF. See also Figure 5.2.2.3.4.1-1.

Figure 5.2.2.3.4.1-1 N1N2 Message UnSubscribe

1\. The NF Service Consumer shall send a DELETE request to delete an
existing subscription resource in the AMF.

2\. If the request is accepted, the AMF shall reply with the status code
204 indicating the resource identified by subscription ID is
successfully deleted, in the response message.

On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status codes together with
the response body listed Table 6.1.3.4.3.1-3 shall be returned.

##### 5.2.2.3.5 N1MessageNotify

###### 5.2.2.3.5.1 General

The N1MessageNotify service operation is used by an AMF notifying the N1
message received from the UE to a destination CN NF, and it is used in
the following procedures:

\- Registration with AMF re-allocation (see clause 4.2.2.2.3 of
3GPP TS 23.502 \[3\])

slicing is used and the initial AMF has obtained).

###### 5.2.2.3.5.3 Using N1MessageNotify in the UE Assisted and UE Based Positioning Procedure

In the UE assisted and UE based positioning procedure, the
N1MessageNotify service operation is invoked by the AMF, towards the
LMF, to notify the N1 UE positioning messages received from the UE.

The requirements specified in clause 5.2.2.3.5.1 shall apply with the
following modifications:

1\. If the corresponding N1 notification URI is not available, the AMF
shall retrieve the NF profile of the NF Service Consumer (e.g. the LMF)
from the NRF using the NF Instance Identifier received during
corresponding N1N2MessageTransfer service operation (see clause
5.2.2.3.1), and further identify the corresponding service instance if
Service Instance Identifier was also received, and fetch N1 Notification
URI from the default notification subscription registered with
\"N1\_MESSAGE\" notification type and \"LPP\" N1 message class (See
Table 6.2.6.2.3-1 and Table 6.2.6.2.4-1 of 3GPP TS 29.510 \[29\]).

2\. Same as step 1 of Figure 5.2.2.3.5.1-1, the request payload shall

The requirements specified in clause 5.2.2.3.6.1 shall apply with the
following modifications:

0\. During an inter AMF handover procedure, the source AMF, acting as a
NF Service Consumer, when invoking the CreateUEContext service operation
(see clause 5.2.2.2.3), shall include a N2Info Notification URI to the
target AMF in the HTTP request message.

1\. Same as step 1 of Figure 5.2.2.3.6.1-1, the request payload shall
contain the following information:

\- notification payload (see clause 6.1.5.5) without the
\"n2InfoContainer\" attribute;

\- the \"notifyReason\" attribute set to \"HANDOVER\_COMPLETED\";

\- the \"smfChangeInfoList\" attribute including the UE\'s PDU Session
ID(s) for which the I-SMF or V-SMF has been changed or removed, if any,
with for each such PDU session, the related \"smfChangeIndication\"
attribute set to \"CHANGED\" or \"REMOVED\", if the I-SMF or the V-SMF
is changed or removed respectively.

\- the \"notifySourceNgRan\" attribute set to \"true\" during an Inter
NG-RAN node N2 based DAPS handover procedure, if the target AMF receives
this indication in the Handover Notify from the target NG-RAN node (see
clause 4.9.1.3.3a of 3GPP TS 23.502 \[3\]).

If any network slice(s) become no longer available and there are PDU
Session(s) associated with them, the target AMF shall include these PDU
session(s) in the toReleaseSessionList attribute in the payload. The
n2NotifySubscriptionId included in the notification payload shall be the
UE context Id.

2\. Same as Step 2a of Figure 5.2.2.3.6.1-1, with the following
additions/modifications:

\- the source AMF shall release the PDU Session(s) listed in the
toReleaseSessionList attribute in the payload;

\- if the smfChangeInfoList attribute was received in the request, the
source AMF shall release the SM Context at the I-SMF or V-SMF only, for
all the PDU sessions listed in the smfChangeInfoList attribute with the
smfChangeIndication attribute set to \"CHANGED\" or \"REMOVED\";

\- the source AMF shall remove the individual ueContext resource. The
source AMF may choose to start a timer to supervise the release of the
UE context resource and may keep the individual ueContext resource until
the timer expires;

\- if Secondary RAT usage data have been received from the source NG-RAN
and buffered at the source AMF for one or more PDU sessions as specified
in step 2a0 of clause 4.9.1.3.3 of 3GPP TS 23.502 \[3\], the source AMF
shall send a 200 OK response with the Secondary RAT usage data included
in the response payload for one or more PDU sessions.

\- if the \"notifySourceNgRan\" attribute was set to \"true\" in the
request, the source AMF shall send a HANDOVER SUCCESS to the source
NG-RAN (see clause 4.9.1.3.3a of 3GPP TS 23.502 \[3\]).

NOTE: This notification is due to an implicit subscription and hence no
explicit subscription Id is created. UE context Id is included as the
notification subscription Id for the NF Service Consumer (e.g. Source
AMF) to co-relate the notification to an earlier initiated UE context
creation during a handover procedure.

###### 5.2.2.3.6.3 Using N2InfoNotify during Location Services procedures

The N2InfoNotify service operation is invoked by a NF Service Producer,
i.e. the AMF, towards the NF Service Consumer, e.g. the LMF, to notify

release the assigned EBI from a QoS flow (see 3GPP TS 23.502 \[3\],
clause 4.11.1.4.3).

The EBIAssignment service operation is invoked by a NF Service Consumer,
e.g. a SMF, towards the NF Service Producer, i.e. the AMF, to request
the AMF to allocate EPS bearer ID(s) towards EPS bearer(s) mapped from
QoS flow(s) for an existing PDU Session for a given UE.

EBI allocation shall apply only to:

\- QoS flows of Single Access PDU Session(s) via 3GPP access supporting
EPS interworking with N26;

\- Qos flows of Multi-Access PDU Session(s) supporting EPS interworking
with N26, that are not only allowed over non-3GPP access.

EBI allocation shall not apply to:

\- PDU Session(s) via 3GPP access supporting EPS interworking without
N26, or;

\- PDU Session(s) via non-3GPP access supporting EPS interworking;

\- GBR QoS flow(s) that are only allowed over non-3GPP access in
Multi-Access PDU Session(s) supporting EPS interworking.

The NF Service Consumer (e.g. the SMF) shall perform EBIAssignment
service operation by invoking \"assign-ebi\" custom operation on the
\"individual ueContext\" resource (See clause 6.1.3.2.4.3). See also
Figure 5.2.2.6.1-1.

Figure 5.2.2.6.1-1 EBI Assignment

1\. The NF Service Consumer, e.g. the SMF, shall invoke \"assign-ebi\"
custom method on individual ueContext resource, which is identified by
the UE\'s SUPI or PEI in the AMF. The NF Service consumer shall provide
PDU Session ID, ARP list and S-NSSAI as input for the service operation.

2a. On success, the AMF shall assign EBI for each ARP in received ARP
list, if enough EBI(s) are available. If there is not enough EBI(s)
available, the AMF may revoke already assigned EBI(s) based on the
ARP(s) and the S-NSSAI of the PDU session for which the request was
received, EBIs information in the UE context and local policies. The AMF
may only assign a subset of the requested EPS Bearer ID(s), e.g. when
other PDU Sessions with higher ARP have occupied other available EPS
Bearer IDs. If AMF has successfully assigned all or part of the
requested EBI(s), the AMF shall respond with the status code 200 OK,
together with the assigned EBI to ARP mapping(s), the list of ARPs for
which the AMF failed to allocate an EBI (if any) and the list of EBI(s)
released for this PDU session due to revocation based on ARP(s) and the
S-NSSAI (if any).

If the request contains \"releasedEbiList\", the AMF shall release the
requested EBI(s). The AMF shall respond with the status code 200 OK and
shall include the EBI(s) released in the \"releasedEbiList\" IE of the
POST response body. The \"releasedEbiList\" in the request shall be
handled before the EBI assignment in AMF.

If the same EBI(s) are both in the \"releasedEbiList\"and
\"assignedEbiList\", the NF sevice consumer considers that EBI(s) have
been released and reassigned.

2b. On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in
Table 6.1.3.2.4.3.2-2 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the
message body shall contain an AssignEbiError structure, including:

\- a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to one of
the application error listed in Table 6.1.3.2.4.3.2-2;

\- a failureDetails which describes the details of the failure including
the list of ARPs for which the EBI assignment failed.

### 5.3.2 Service Operations

#### 5.3.2.1 Introduction

For the Namf\_EventExposure service the following service operations are
defined:

\- Subscribe;

\- Unsubscribe;

\- Notify.

#### 5.3.2.2 Subscribe

##### 5.3.2.2.1 General

The Service Operation is used by a NF Service Consumer (e.g. NEF) to
subscribe to an event(s) for one UE, group of UE(s) or any UE.

##### 5.3.2.2.2 Creation of a subscription

The Subscribe service operation is invoked by a NF Service Consumer,
e.g. NEF, towards the AMF, when it needs to create a subscription to
monitor at least one event relevant to the AMF. The NF Service Consumer
may subscribe to multiple events in a subscription. A subscription may
be associated with one UE, a group of UEs or any UE.

The NF Service Consumer shall request to create a new subscription by
using HTTP method POST with URI of the subscriptions collection, see
clause 6.2.3.2.

The NF Service Consumer shall include the following information in the
HTTP message body:

\- NF ID, indicates the identity of the network function instance
initiating the subscription;

\- Subscription Target, indicates the target(s) to be monitored, as one
of the following types:

\- A specific UE, identified with a SUPI, a PEI or a GPSI;

\- A group of UEs, identified with a group identity;

\- Any UE, identified by the \"anyUE\" flag.

\- Notification URI, indicates the address to deliver the event
notifications generated by the subscription;

\- Notification Correlation ID, indicates the correlation identity to be
carried in the event notifications generated by the subscription;

\- List of events to be subscribed;

\- Event Types per event, as specified in clause 5.3.1.

The NF Service Consumer may include the following information in the
HTTP message body:

\- Immediate Report Flag per event, indicates an immediate report to be
generated with current event status;

\- Event Trigger, indicates how the events shall be reported (One-time
Reporting or Continuously Reporting).

\- Maximum Number of Reports, defines the maximum number of reports
after which the event subscription ceases to exist;

\- Expiry, defines maximum duration after which the event subscription
ceases to exist;

\- Sampling ratio, defines the random subset of UEs among target UEs,
and AMF only report the event(s) related to the selected subset of UEs;

\- Periodic Report Flag per event, indicates the report to be generated
periodically;

\- Repetition Period, defines the period for periodic reporting;

\- Event Filter per applicable event, defines further options on how the
event shall be reported.

\- Reference Id per event, indicates the value of the Reference Id
associated with the event to be monitored. If provided, the Reference Id
shall be included in the reports triggered by the event.

Figure 5.3.2.2.2-1 Subscribe for Creation

1\. The NF Service Consumer shall send a POST request to create a
subscription resource in the AMF. The payload body of the POST request
shall contain a representation of the individual subscription resource
to be created. The request may contain an expiry time, suggested by the
NF Service Consumer as a hint, representing the time upto which the
subscription is desired to be kept active and the time after which the
subscribed event(s) shall stop generating report.

2a. On success, the request is accepted, the AMF shall include a HTTP
Location header to provide the location of a newly created resource
(subscription) together with the status code 201 indicating the
requested resource is created in the response message. If the NF Service
Consumer has included more than one events in the event subscription and
some of the events are failed to be subscribed, the AMF shall accept the
message and provide the successfully subscribed event(s) in
AmfEventSubscription. If the NF Service Consumer has included the
immediateFlag with value as \"true\" in the event subscription, the AMF
shall include the current status of the events subscribed, if available
(e.g. last known location information is included if the subscribed
event is LOCATION\_REPORT). If the events with immediateFlag set to
\"true\" are subscribed by an NF service consumer on behalf of a third
NF and the NF service consumer has not indicated supporting of IERSR
feature (see 6.2.8), the notification will be sent to the third NF
directly, i.e. subsChangeNotifyUri is included in the event
subscription, the current status of the events subscribed shall not be
included in response. The AMF shall subsequently send a notification to
the third NF including the current status of the events subscribed.\
\
If the NF Service Consumer has set the event reporting option as
ONE\_TIME and if the AMF has included the current status of the events
subscribed in the response, then the AMF shall not do any subsequent
event notification for the events given in the
AmfCreateEventSubscription parameter. If the NF Service Consumer has set
the event reporting option as ONE\_TIME, the subscribed event as
LOCATION\_REPORT and the immediateFlag is set to false or absent, the
AMF shall send an event notification to notify the current location of
the UE after the subscription.

The response, based on operator policy and taking into account the
expiry time included in the request, may contain the expiry time, as
determined by the AMF, after which the subscription becomes invalid.
Once the subscription expires, if the NF Service Consumer wants to keep
receiving notifications, it shall create a new subscription in the AMF.
The AMF shall not provide the same expiry time for many subscriptions in
order to avoid all of them expiring and recreating the subscription at
the same time. If the expiry time is not included in the response, the
NF Service Consumer shall consider the subscription to be valid without
an expiry time.

If the sampling ratio (\"sampRatio\") attribute is included in the
subscription, the AMF shall select a random subset of UEs among target
UEs according to the sampling ratio and only report the event(s) related
to the selected subset of UEs.

If the NF service consumer is a UDM, the AMF and the UDM both support
the \"ESSYNC\" feature and the subscription is targeting a specific UE
with Reference Id(s) included in the subscription, the AMF shall locally
store the information that the event subscription is subject to the
Event Subscription Synchronization with UDM during EPS to 5GS mobility
as specified in clause 5.3.2.4.2. During inter-AMF mobility procedures,
the source AMF shall include the \"eventSyncInd\" IE (in
AmfEventSubscriptionAddInfo data type) with the value \"true\" in the UE
Context for the event subscriptions that are subject to Event
Subscription Synchronization with UDM.

2b. On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in
Table 6.2.3.2.3.1-3 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the
message body shall contain a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\"
attribute set to one of the application error listed in Table
6.2.3.2.3.1-3.

##### 5.3.2.2.3 Modification of a subscription

The Subscribe service operation is invoked by a NF Service Consumer,
e.g. NEF, towards the AMF, when it needs to modify an existing
subscription previously created by itself at the AMF.

The NF Service Consumer shall modify the subscription by using HTTP
method PATCH with the URI of the individual subscription resource (see
clause 6.2.3.3) to be modified.

See also Figure 5.3.2.2.3-1 below.

Figure 5.3.2.2.3-1 Modification of a Subscription

1\. The NF Service Consumer shall send a PATCH request to modify a
subscription resource in the AMF. The modification may be for the events
subscribed or for updating the event options.

2a. On success, the request is accepted, the AMF shall return the
representation of the modified subscription resource or its sub-resource
together with the status code 200 OK. When the PATCH request is for
modifying the expiry attribute of the options IE of the subscription,
then the AMF based on operator policies and taking into account the
expiry time included in the request, shall include an expiry time, after
which the subscription becomes invalid. Once the subscription expires,
if the NF Service Consumer wants to keep receiving notifications, it
shall create a new subscription in the AMF, as specified in
clause 5.3.2.2.2. The AMF shall not provide the same expiry time for
many subscriptions in order to avoid all of them expiring and recreating
the subscription at the same time.

2b. On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in
Table 6.2.3.3.3.1-3 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the
message body shall contain a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\"
attribute set to one of the application error listed in Table
6.2.3.3.3.1-3.

#### 5.3.2.3 Unsubscribe

##### 5.3.2.3.1 General

The Unsubscribe service operation is invoked by a NF Service Consumer,
e.g. NEF, towards the AMF, to remove an existing subscription previously
created by itself at the AMF.

The NF Service Consumer shall unsubscribe to the subscription by using
HTTP method DELETE with the URI of the individual subscription resource
(see clause 6.2.3.3) to be deleted.

Figure 5.3.2.3.1-1 Unsubscribe a subscription

1\. The NF Service Consumer shall send a DELETE request to delete an
existing subscription resource in the AMF.

2a. On success, the request is accepted, the AMF shall reply with the
status code 204 indicating the resource identified by subscription ID is
successfully deleted in the response message.

2b. On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in
Table 6.2.3.3.3.2-3 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the
message body shall contain a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\"
attribute set to one of the application error listed in Table
6.2.3.3.3.2-3.

#### 5.3.2.4 Notify

##### 5.3.2.4.1 General

The Notify service operation is invoked by the AMF, to send a
notification, towards the notification URI, when certain event included
in the subscription has taken place.

The AMF shall use the HTTP method POST, using the notification URI
received in the subscription creation as specified in clause 5.3.2.2.2,
including e.g. the subscription ID, Event ID(s) for which event has
happened, notification correlation ID provided by the NF service
consumer at the time of event subscription, to send a notification. See
Figure 5.3.2.4.1-1.

Additionally, the Notify service operation shall also be invoked by the
AMF, when there is a change of AMF during UE mobility procedures and if
the subscription Id changes (i.e. Registration procedures and Handover
procedures).

Figure 5.3.2.4.1-1 Notify

1\. The AMF shall send a POST request to send a notification.

2a. On success, \"204 No content\" shall be returned by the NF Service
Consumer.

2b. On failure or redirection, the appropriate HTTP status code (e.g.
\"403 Forbidden\") indicating the error shall be returned and
appropriate additional error information should be returned.

##### 5.3.2.4.2 Event Subscription Synchronization for specific UE

When the AMF and the UDM both support the \"ESSYNC\" feature, the AMF
may initiate synchronization for event subscriptions with the UDM for
the specific UE during EPS to 5GS mobility registration procedure (see
clause 4.11.5.2 of 3GPP TS 23.502 \[3\]), if UE specific event
subscriptions from the UDM are available in UE Context.

To initiate event subscription synchronization, when sending
notification for subscription change to the UDM, the AMF shall include
the event subscription information in the notification request. If
subscription change notification is not needed, e.g. when UE registers
to the same AMF after moving from EPS, the AMF may send a notification
to the subscription change notification URI. The notification request in
this case only includes the event subscription information but no event
report list,

The AMF shall only include active event subscriptions that are subject
to Event Subscription Synchronization with UDM (determined as defined in
clause 5.3.2.2.2) in the event subscription information.

For each active subscription, the following information shall include:

\- URI of the subscription resource in the AMF; and

\- Notification Correlation Id of the subscription; and

\- list of Reference Ids, one per event in the subscription; and

\- optionally, the URI of old subscription resource on the source AMF,
if the subscription Id is changed during the mobility procedure.

When the UDM receives event subscription information from AMF, the UDM
shall compare the active event subscriptions in AMF with the active UDM
Event Exposure subscriptions using Reference Id(s) and Notification
Correlation Id, and perform the following:

\- if an event is to be detected by AMF but not existing in the AMF, the
UDM shall subscribe the event in AMF by creating a new AMF event
subscription or updating an existing AMF event subscription;

\- if an event exists in AMF but does not exist in UDM, the UDM shall
unsubscribe the event from AMF by removing or update an AMF event
subscription.

5.4 Namf\_MT Service

Service Consumer (e.g. SMSF, SMF) to enable the reachability of the UE.

The NF Service Consumer shall invoke the service by using the HTTP
method PUT, towards the URI of a \"ueReachInd\" resource as specified in
clause 6.3.3.2. See also figure 5.4.2.2.1-1.

Figure 5.4.2.2.2-1: NF Service Consumer enables the reachability of the
UE

1\. The NF Service Consumer sends a PUT request to the resource
representing the ueReachInd resource of the AMF. The payload body of the
PUT request shall contain an \"EnableUeReachabilityReqData\" object.

2a. On success:

\- if the UE is in CM-CONNECTED state, the AMF shall immediately respond
using \"200 OK\" status code, with payload containing an
\"EnableUeReachabilityRspData\" object.

\- if the UE is in CM-IDLE state and the NAS message is to be sent over
via 3GPP access, the AMF shall page the UE. When UE becomes
CM-CONNECTED, \"200 OK\" shall be returned with payload containing an
\"EnableUeReachabilityRspData\" object.

2b. On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in
Table 6.3.3.2.3.1-3 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the
message body shall contain a ProblemDetails or
ProblemDetailsEnableUeReachability structure with the \"cause\"
attribute set to one of the application error listed in Table
6.3.3.2.3.1-3.

The AMF shall respond with the status code \"403 Forbidden\", if the UE
is in a Non-Allowed Area and the service request is not for regulatory
prioritized service. The AMF shall set the application error as
\"UE\_IN\_NON\_ALLOWED\_AREA\" in POST response body.

#### 5.4.2.3 ProvideDomainSelectionInfo

##### 5.4.2.3.1 General

The ProvideDomainSelectionInfo service operation shall be invoked by the
NF Service Consumer (e.g. UDM) to get the UE information for terminating
domain selection of IMS voice, including following information:

\- Indication of supporting IMS voice over PS Session;

\- Time stamp of the last radio contact with the UE;

\- Current Access type and RAT type

The NF Service Consumer shall invoke the service by using the HTTP GET
towards the URI of the \"UeContext\" resource (See clause 6.3.3.3.3.1).
See also figure 5.4.2.3.1-1.

Figure 5.4.2.3.1-1: Provide UE Information for Terminating Domain
Selection

1\. The NF Service Consumer shall send a GET request to the URI of the
\"UeContext\" resource on the AMF, with query parameter \"info-class\"
set to value \"TADS\".

2a. On success, the AMF shall return \"200 OK\" status code with payload
containing an \"UeContextInfo\" data structure including UE information
for terminating domain selection for IMS voice.

2b. On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in
Table 6.3.3.3.3.1-3 shall be returned. The message body shall contain a
ProblemDetails object with \"detail\" set to one of the corresponding
application errors listed in Table 6.3.3.3.3.1-3.

5.5 Namf\_Location Service
--------------------------

### 5.5.1 Service Description

The Namf\_Location service is used by NF service consumers to request
the AMF for initiating positioning requests and provide the location
information. It is also used to subsequently notify the location change
events towards the NF service consumers. The following are the key
functionalities of this NF service:

\- Allow NFs to request the current geodetic and optionally civic
location of a target UE.

\- Allow NFs to be notified of event information related to emergency
sessions.

\- Allow NFs to request Network Provided Location Information (NPLI)
and/or local time zone corresponding to the location of a target UE.

### 5.5.2 Service Operations

#### 5.5.2.1 Introduction

For the Namf\_Location Service the following service operations are
defined:

\- ProvidePositioningInfo;

\- EventNotify; and

\- ProvideLocationInfo.

\- CancelLocation

#### 5.5.2.2 ProvidePositioningInfo

##### 5.5.2.2.1 General

The ProvidePositioningInfo service operation is used in the following
procedure:

\- 5GC-MT-LR Procedure without UDM Query (see 3GPP TS 23.273 \[42\],
clause 6.10.2)

\- 5GC-MT-LR Procedure (see 3GPP TS 23.273 \[42\], clause 6.1)

\- Initiation and Reporting of Location Events (see
3GPP TS 23.273 \[42\], clause 6.3.1)

\- Location Continuity for Handover of an Emergency session from NG-RAN
(see 3GPP TS 23.273 \[42\], clause 6.10.3)

The ProvidePositioningInfo service operation shall be invoked by the NF
Service Consumer (e.g. GMLC) to request the current or deferred geodetic
and optionally civic location of the UE. The service operation triggers
the AMF to invoke the service towards the LMF.

The NF Service Consumer shall invoke the service operation by sending
POST to the URI of the \"provide-pos-info\" custom operation on the
\"Individual UE Context\" resource (See clause 6.4.3.2.4.2). See also
figure 5.5.2.2.1-1.

Figure 5.5.2.2.1-1: NF Service Consumer requests the positioning
information of the UE

1\. The NF Service Consumer shall send a POST request to the resource
URI of \"provide-pos-info\" custom operation of the \"*Individual UE
context\"* resource of the AMF. The payload body of the POST request may
contain an indication of a positioning request from an emergency
services or commercial services client, the required QoS and Supported
GAD shapes. If the NF service consumer wants the location change
information or deferred location information to be notified (e.g. during
a handover procedure or for activation or completion of deferred
location), it also provides a callback URI on which the EventNotify
service operation is executed (see clause 5.5.2.3).

2a. On success, \"200 OK\" shall be returned, the payload body
containing the LCS correlation identifier, the location estimate, its
age and accuracy and the information about the positioning method. If
the request is invoked during a handover the response body shall also
include the target AMF node identifier as specified in clause 6.10.3 of
3GPP TS 23.273 \[42\].

2b. On accept, \"204 No Content\" shall be returned to acknowledge that
AMF supports a deferred location request and a deferred location is
accepted as specified in step 6 of clause 6.3.1 of
3GPP TS 23.273 \[42\];

2c. On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in
Table 6.4.3.2.4.2.2-2 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the
message body shall contain a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\"
attribute set to one of the application error listed in Table
6.4.3.2.4.2.2-2.

#### 5.5.2.3 EventNotify

##### 5.5.2.3.1 General

The EventNotify service operation is used in the following procedure:

\- 5GC-NI-LR Procedure (see 3GPP TS 23.273 \[42\], clause 6.10.1)

\- Location Continuity for Handover of an Emergency session from NG-RAN
(see 3GPP TS 23.273 \[42\], clause 6.10.3)

\- Completion of a deferred location for the UE available event or
activation of deferred location for periodic location, area event
triggered location or motion event triggered location (see
3GPP TS 23.273 \[42\], clause 6.3.1)

The EventNotify service operation notifies the NF Service Consumer (i.e.
GMLC) about a UE location related event information related to emergency
sessions or deferred location, i.e. the initiation, handover or
termination of an emergency session or the completion or activation of
deferred location. The notification is delivered to:

\- the callback URI received from the GMLC during an earlier
ProvidePositioningInfo service operation, if any;

Otherwise (if not available),

\- the callback URI registered in the NRF, if the GMLC registered to the
NRF with notification endpoints for location notifications (see clauses
6.1.6.2.4 and 6.1.6.3.4 of 3GPP TS 29.510 \[29\]);

Otherwise (if not available),

\- GMLC URI locally provisioned in the AMF.

NOTE: During a handover procedure, both the source AMF and the target
AMF can invoke the EventNotify service operation, based on the local
configuration.

The operation is invoked by issuing a POST request to the callback URI
of the NF Service Consumer (See clause 6.4.5.2.2). See also figure
5.5.2.3.1-1.

Figure 5.5.2.3.1-1: UE Location Notification

1\. The AMF shall send a POST request to the callback URI provided by
the NF service consumer determined as described above. The request body
shall include the type of location related event and UE Identification
(SUPI or PEI), and may include the GPSI, Geodetic Location, Civic
Location, MSC server identity, the Position methods used or a serving
LMF identification for activation of periodic or triggered location.

2a. On success, \"204 No content\" shall be returned by the NF Service
Consumer.

2b. On failure or redirection, the appropriate HTTP status code (e.g.
\"403 Forbidden\") indicating the error shall be returned and
appropriate additional error information should be returned.

#### 5.5.2.4 ProvideLocationInfo

##### 5.5.2.4.1 General

The ProvideLocationInfo service operation allows an NF Service Consumer
(e.g. UDM) to request the Network Provided Location Information (NPLI)
of a target UE.

The NF Service Consumer shall invoke the service operation by sending
POST request to the URI of the \"provide-loc-info\" custom operation on
the \"Individual UE Context\" resource (see clause 6.4.3.2.4.3), as
shown in figure 5.5.2.4.1-1.

Figure 5.5.2.4.1-1: NF Service Consumer requests the Location
Information of the UE

1\. The NF Service Consumer shall send a POST request to the resource
URI of \"provide-loc-info\" custom operation of the \"*Individual UE
context\"* resource on the AMF. The payload body of the POST request
shall contain a \"requestLocInfo\" data structure indicating the desired
type of location information.

If the NF Service Consumer desires the current location information of
the target UE, it shall set \"reqCurrentLoc\" attribute to \"true\".

2a. On success, \"200 OK\" response shall be returned. The payload body
of the response shall contain a \"ProvideLocInfo\" data structure
including the Network Provide Location Information (NPLI) of the target
UE.

If \"reqCurrentLoc\" attribute is set to \"true\" and the UE is in
RM-REGISTERED and CM-IDLE state over 3GPP access, the AMF shall initiate
a paging procedure to the UE. If the paging procedure is successful, the
AMF shall return the current location information and set \"currentLoc\"
attribute to \"true\" in the response; if the UE does not respond to the
paging, the AMF shall provide the last known location and set
\"currentLoc\" attribute to \"false\" in the response.

If \"reqCurrentLoc\" attribute is set to \"true\" and the UE is in
RM-REGISTERED and CM-CONNECTED state over 3GPP access, the AMF shall
follow NG-RAN Location reporting procedure, as specified in clause 4.10
of 3GPP TS 23.502 \[3\], to trigger a single standalone report by
setting \"direct\" event type in **Location Reporting Control message.
If NG-RAN reports current location of the UE, the AMF shall** set
\"currentLoc\" attribute to \"true\" in the response; if NG-RAN reports
last known location of the UE with timestamp, the AMF shall set
\"currentLoc\" attribute to \"false\" in the response.

If the UE is in RM-REGISTERED over non-3GPP access, the AMF shall
include the latest non-3GPP access location information.

2b. On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in
table 6.4.3.2.4.3.2-2 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the
message body shall contain a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\"
attribute set to one of the application error listed in
table 6.4.3.2.4.3.2-2.

#### 5.5.2.5 CancelLocation

##### 5.5.2.5.1 General

This service operation is used in the following procedure:

\- Cancellation of Reporting of Location Events by an AF or External LCS
Client (see 3GPP TS 23.273 \[42\], clause 6.3.3)

The CancelLocation service operation shall be invoked by the NF Service
Consumer (e.g. GMLC) to cancel reporting periodic or events triggered
location.

The NF Service Consumer shall invoke the service operation by sending a
POST request to the URI of the \"cancel-pos-info\" custom operation on
the \"Individual UE Context\" resource (See clause 6.4.3.2.4.4). See
also figure 5.5.2.5.1-1.

Figure 5.5.2.5.1-1: Cancellation of reporting periodic or events
triggered location of the UE

1\. The NF Service Consumer shall send a POST request to the resource
URI of \"cancel-pos-info\" custom operation of the \"*Individual UE
context\"* resource of the AMF. The payload body of the POST request
shall contain a \"CancelLocInfo\" data structure indicating the desired
cancellation of reporting periodic or events triggered location of the
UE.

2a. On success, AMF responds with \"204 No Content\".

2b. On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in
Table 6.4.3.2.4.4-2 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the
message body shall contain a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\"
attribute set to one of the application errors.

6 API Definitions

  vnd.3gpp.5gnas                                                                                                                                                                            Binary encoded payload, encoding a 5GS NAS message, as specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 \[11\].
  NOTE: Using 3GPP vendor content subtypes allows to describe the nature of the opaque payload (e.g. NGAP or 5GS NAS information) without having to rely on metadata in the JSON payload.   
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

See clause 6.1.2.4 for the binary payloads supported in the binary body
part of multipart messages.

#### 6.1.2.3 HTTP custom headers

##### 6.1.2.3.1 General

In this release of this specification, no custom headers specific to the
Namf\_Communication service are defined. For 3GPP specific HTTP custom
headers used across all service based interfaces, see clause 5.2.3 of
3GPP TS 29.500 \[4\].

#### 6.1.2.4 HTTP multipart messages

HTTP multipart messages shall be supported, to transfer opaque N1
Information (e.g. SM, LPP) and/or N2 Information (e.g. SM, NRPPa, PWS),
in the following service operations (and HTTP messages):

\- N1N2MessageTransfer Request and Response (POST);

\- NonUeN2MessageTransfer Request and Response (POST);

\- N1MessageNotify (POST);

\- N2InfoNotify (POST);

\- NonUeN2InfoNotify (POST);

\- UEContextTransfer (POST);

\- CreateUEContext (PUT)

HTTP multipart messages shall include one JSON body part and one or more
binary body parts comprising:

\- N1payload, and/or N2 payload (see clause 6.1.6.4).

The JSON body part shall be the \"root\" body part of the multipart
message. It shall be encoded as the first body part of the multipart
message. The \"Start\" parameter does not need to be included.

The multipart message shall include a \"type\" parameter (see
IETF RFC 2387 \[9\]) specifying the media type of the root body part,
i.e. \"application/json\".

NOTE: The \"root\" body part (or \"root\" object) is the first body part
the application processes when receiving a multipart/related message,
see IETF RFC 2387 \[9\]. The default root is the first body within the
multipart/related message. The \"Start\" parameter indicates the root
body part, e.g. when this is not the first body part in the message.

For each binary body part in a HTTP multipart message, the binary body
part shall include a Content-ID header (see IETF RFC 2045 \[10\]), and
the JSON body part shall include an attribute, defined with the
RefToBinaryData type, that contains the value of the Content-ID header
field of the referenced binary body part.

###### 6.1.6.4.3.3 NGAP Messages

For N2 information class PWS, N2 Information shall encode NGAP Messages
specified in 3GPP TS 38.413 \[12\].

Table 6.1.6.4.3.3-1: N2 PWS Request Information content

+-------------------------------+-------------------------+
| NGAP message                  | Reference               |

| WRITE-REPLACE WARNING REQUEST | 9.2.8.1                 |
+-------------------------------+-------------------------+
| PWS CANCEL REQUEST            | 9.2.8.3                 |
+-------------------------------+-------------------------+

N2 Information received by the AMF for PWS may be processed by the AMF
before re-encoding and transferring to the Service Consumer:

\- If a subscription exists for N2InformationClass \"PWS-BCAL\" and the
received N2 Message Type is a WRITE-REPLACE-WARNING-RESPONSE, then the
AMF may aggregate the Broadcast Completed Area Lists it has received
from the NG-RAN nodes for a message identified by its Serial Number and
Message Identifier (see table 6.1.6.4.3-1).

\- If a subscription exists for N2InformationClass \"PWS-BCAL\" and the
received N2 Message Type is a PWS-CANCEL-RESPONSE, then the AMF may
aggregate the Broadcast Cancelled Area Lists IE it has received from the
NG-RAN nodes for a message identified by its Serial Number and Message
Identifier (see table 6.1.6.4.3-1). If an NG-RAN node has responded
without the Broadcast Cancelled Area List, then the AMF shall include
the ID of that NG-RAN node in \"bcEmptyAreaList\" attribute in the PWS
N2 information.

+--------------------------------+-------------------------+
| PWS CANCEL RESPONSE            | 9.2.8.4                 |
+--------------------------------+-------------------------+

If a subscription exists for N2InformationClass \"PWS-BCAL\" and the
received N2 Message Type is a WRITE-REPLACE-WARNING-RESPONSE, then the
AMF may transfer the ASN.1 (re-)encoded Message Type, Message
Identifier, Serial Number and the (aggregated) Broadcast Completed Area
List IE in the N2 Info Container in the N2InfoNotify.

If a subscription exists for N2InformationClass \"PWS-BCAL\" and the
received N2 Message Type is a PWS-CANCEL-RESPONSE, then the AMF may
transfer the ASN.1 (re-)encoded the Message Type, Message Identifier,
Serial Number, the (aggregated) Broadcast Cancelled Area List IE in the
N2 Info Container in the N2InfoNotify, and the \"bcEmptyAreaList\"
attribute if not empty in the PWS N2 information.

For the ASN.1 definition for encoding the WRITE-REPLACE-WARNING-RESPONSE
and the PWS-CANCEL-RESPONSE, see clause 9.4 of 3GPP TS 38.413 \[12\].

If a subscription exists for N2InformationClass \"PWS-RF\" and the
received N2 Message Type is a PWS-RESTART-INDICATION, then the AMF may
transfer the ASN.1 encoded string from the PWS-RESTART-INDICATION (see
table 6.1.6.4.3-2) in the N2 Info Container in the N2InfoNotify.

If a subscription exists for N2InformationClass \"PWS-RF\" and the
received N2 Message Type is a PWS-FAILURE-INDICATION (see table
6.1.6.4.3-2), then the AMF may transfer the ASN1 encoded string from the
PWS-FAILURE-INDICATION in the N2 Info Container in the N2InfoNotify.

  EBI\_EXHAUSTED                             403 Forbidden            Allocation of EPS Bearer ID failed due to exhaustion of EBI as the maximum number of EBIs has already been allocated to the UE.
  EBI\_REJECTED\_LOCAL\_POLICY               403 Forbidden            Allocation of EPS Bearer ID failed due to local policy at the AMF as specified in clause 4.11.1.4.1 of 3GPP TS 23.502 \[3\].
  EBI\_REJECTED\_NO\_N26                     403 Forbidden            The allocation of EPS Bearer ID was rejected when the AMF is in a serving PLMN that does not support 5GS-EPS interworking procedures with N26 interface.
  SUPI\_OR\_PEI\_UNKNOWN                     403 Forbidden            The SUPI or PEI included in the message is unknown.
  UE\_IN\_NON\_ALLOWED\_AREA                 403 Forbidden            UE is currently in a non-allowed area hence the N1/N2 message transfer cannot be completed because the request is not associated with a regulatory prioritized service.
  UNSPECIFIED                                403 Forbidden            The request is rejected due to unspecified reasons.
  SM\_CONTEXT\_RELOCATION\_REQUIRED          403 Forbidden            The request is rejected because the SM Context should be relocated to another SMF, e.g. when AMF detects that an I-SMF or V-SMF insertion, change or removal is needed, as specified in clause 4.23 of 3GPP TS 23.502 \[3\].
  UE\_WITHOUT\_N1\_LPP\_SUPPORT              403 Forbidden            UE does not support LPP in N1 mode hence the N1 LPP message cannot be sent to the UE.
  CONTEXT\_NOT\_FOUND                        404 Not Found            The requested UE Context does not exist on the AMF
  HIGHER\_PRIORITY\_REQUEST\_ONGOING         409 Conflict             Paging triggered N1/N2 transfer cannot be initiated since already there is a paging due to a higher priority session ongoing.

### 6.1.9 Security

As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.501 \[27\], the access to the
Namf\_Communication API may be authorized by means of the OAuth2
protocol (see IETF RFC 6749 \[28\]), using the \"Client Credentials\"
authorization grant, where the NRF (see 3GPP TS 29.510 \[29\]) plays the
role of the authorization server.

If Oauth2 authorization is used, an NF Service Consumer, prior to
consuming services offered by the Namf\_Communication API, shall obtain
a \"token\" from the authorization server, by invoking the Access Token
Request service, as described in 3GPP TS 29.510 \[29\], clause 5.4.2.2.

NOTE: When multiple NRFs are deployed in a network, the NRF used as
authorization server is the same NRF that the NF Service Consumer used
for discovering the Namf\_Communication service.

The Namf\_Communication API defines scopes for OAuth2 authorization as
specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 \[27\]; it defines a single scope consisting
on the name of the service (i.e., \"namf-comm\"), and it does not define
any additional scopes at resource or operation level.

### 6.1.10 HTTP redirection

An HTTP request may be redirected to a different AMF service instance,
within the same AMF or a different AMF of an AMF set, e.g. when an AMF
service instance is part of an AMF (service) set or when using indirect
communications (see 3GPP TS 29.500 \[4\]). See the ES3XX feature in
clause 6.1.8.

An SCP that reselects a different AMF producer instance will return the
NF Instance ID of the new AMF producer instance in the
3gpp-Sbi-Producer-Id header, as specified in clause 6.10.3.4 of 3GPP TS
29.500 \[4\].

If an AMF within an AMF set redirects a service request to a different
AMF of the set using an 307 Temporary Redirect or 308 Permanent Redirect
status code, the identity of the new AMF towards which the service
request is redirected shall be indicated in the 3gpp-Sbi-Target-Nf-Id
header of the 307 Temporary Redirect or 308 Permanent Redirect response
as specified in clause 6.10.9.1 of 3GPP TS 29.500 \[4\].

6.2 Namf\_EventExposure Service API
-----------------------------------

### 6.2.1 API URI

The Namf\_EventExposure shall use the Namf\_EventExposure API.

The API URI of the Namf\_EventExposure API shall be:

**{apiRoot}/\<apiName\>/\<apiVersion\>/**

The request URI used in HTTP requests from the NF service consumer
towards the NF service producer shall have the Resource URI structure
defined in clause 4.4.1 of 3GPP TS 29.501 \[5\], i.e.:

**{apiRoot}/\<apiName\>/\<apiVersion\>/\<apiSpecificResourceUriPart\>**

with the following components:

\- The {apiRoot} shall be set as described in 3GPP TS 29.501 \[5\].

\- The \<apiName\> shall be \"namf-evts\".

\- The \<apiVersion\> shall be \"v1\".

\- The \<apiSpecificResourceUriPart\> shall be set as described in
clause 6.2.3.

### 6.2.2 Usage of HTTP

#### 6.2.2.1 General

HTTP/2, as defined in IETF RFC 7540 \[19\], shall be used as specified
in clause 5 of 3GPP TS 29.500 \[4\].

HTTP/2 shall be transported as specified in clause 5.3 of
3GPP TS 29.500 \[4\].

HTTP messages and bodies for the Namf\_EventExposure service shall
comply with the OpenAPI \[23\] specification contained in Annex A.

#### 6.2.2.2 HTTP standard headers

##### 6.2.2.2.1 General

The usage of HTTP standard headers shall be supported as specified in
clause 5.2.2 of 3GPP TS 29.500 \[4\].

##### 6.2.2.2.2 Content type

The following content types shall be supported:

\- JSON, as defined in IETF RFC 8259 \[8\], shall be used as content
type of the HTTP bodies specified in the present specification as
indicated in clause 5.4 of 3GPP TS 29.500 \[4\].

\- The Problem Details JSON Object (IETF RFC 7807 \[36\]). The use of
the Problem Details JSON object in a HTTP response body shall be
signalled by the content type \"application/problem+json\".

\- JSON Patch (IETF RFC 6902 \[14\]). The use of the JSON Patch format
in a HTTP request body shall be signalled by the content type
\"application/json-patch+json\".

#### 6.2.2.3 HTTP custom headers

##### 6.2.2.3.1 General

In this release of this specification, no custom headers specific to the
Namf\_EventExposure service are defined. For 3GPP specific HTTP custom
headers used across all service based interfaces, see clause 5.2.3 of
3GPP TS 29.500 \[4\].

Table 6.2.6.3.3-1: Enumeration AmfEventType

  Enumeration value                              Description
  ---------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  \"LOCATION\_REPORT\"                           A NF subscribes to this event to receive the Last Known Location or the current Location of a UE or a group of UEs, and Updated Location of the UE or any UE in the group when AMF becomes aware of a location change of the UE.
  \"PRESENCE\_IN\_AOI\_REPORT\"                  A NF subscribes to this event to receive the current present state of a UE in a specific Area of Interest (AOI), and notification when a specified UE enters or leaves the specified area. The area could be identified by a TA list, an area ID or specific interest area name like \"LADN\".
  \"TIMEZONE\_REPORT\"                           A NF subscribes to this event to receive the current time zone of a UE or a group of UEs, and updated time zone of the UE or any UE in the group when AMF becomes aware of a time zone change of the UE.
  \"ACCESS\_TYPE\_REPORT\"                       A NF subscribes to this event to receive the current access type(s) of a UE or a group of UEs, and updated access type(s) of the UE or any UE in the group when AMF becomes aware of the access type change of the UE.
  \"REGISTRATION\_STATE\_REPORT\"                A NF subscribes to this event to receive the current registration state of a UE or a group of UEs, and report for updated registration state of a UE or any UE in the group when AMF becomes aware of a registration state change of the UE.
  \"CONNECTIVITY\_STATE\_REPORT\"                A NF subscribes to this event to receive the current connection management state of a UE or a group of UEs, and report for updated connection management state of a UE or any UE in the group when AMF becomes aware of a connection management state change of the UE.
  \"REACHABILITY\_REPORT\"                       A NF subscribes to this event to receive the current reachability of a UE or a group of UEs, and report for updated reachability of a UE or any UE in the group when AMF becomes aware of a reachability change of the UE.
  \"COMMUNICATION\_FAILURE\_REPORT\"             A NF subscribes to this event to receive the Communication failure report of a UE or group of UEs or any UE.
  \"UES\_IN\_AREA\_REPORT\"                      A NF subscribes to this event to receive the number of UEs in a specific area.
  \"SUBSCRIPTION\_ID\_CHANGE\"                   This event type is used by the AMF to inform the NF service consumer that the subscription Id for the event subscription is changed (e.g. Subscription Id creation at the target AMF for individual UE level event subscriptions, during mobility registration or handover procedures involving an AMF change). This event needs no explicit subscription form an NF service consumer.
  \"SUBSCRIPTION\_ID\_ADDITION\"                 This event type is used by the AMF to inform the NF service consumer that a new subscription Id is added (e.g creation of an event subscription for a UE group level event subscription at the target AMF, during mobility registration or handover procedures involving AMF change for a UE belonging to a group Id and when such a UE is the first UE of the group registering at the target AMF). This event needs no explicit subscription form the NF service consumer.
  \"LOSS\_OF\_CONNECTIVITY\"                     An NF subscribes to this event to receive the event report of a UE or group of UEs when AMF detects that a target UE is no longer reachable for either signalling or user plane communication. Such condition is identified when Mobile Reachable timer expires in the AMF (see 3GPP TS 23.501 \[2\]), when the UE detaches and when AMF deregisters from UDM for an active UE. If the UE is already not reachable for either signalling or user plane communication when the event is subscribed, the AMF reports the event directly.
  \"5GS\_USER\_STATE\_REPORT\"                   A NF subscribes to this event to receive the 5GS user state of a UE.
  \"AVAILABILITY\_AFTER\_DDN\_FAILURE\"          A NF subscribes to this event to be notified about the Availability of a UE after a DDN failure.
  \"TYPE\_ALLOCATION\_CODE\_REPORT\"             A NF subscribes to this event to receive the TAC of a UE or group of UEs.
  \"FREQUENT\_MOBILITY\_REGISTRATION\_REPORT\"   A NF subscribes to this event to receive the number of mobility registration procedures during a period of a UE or group of UEs.

### 6.2.9 Security

As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.501 \[27\], the access to the
Namf\_EventExposure API may be authorized by means of the OAuth2
protocol (see IETF RFC 6749 \[28\]), using the \"Client Credentials\"
authorization grant, where the NRF (see 3GPP TS 29.510 \[29\]) plays the
role of the authorization server.

If Oauth2 authorization is used, an NF Service Consumer, prior to
consuming services offered by the Namf\_EventExposure API, shall obtain
a \"token\" from the authorization server, by invoking the Access Token
Request service, as described in 3GPP TS 29.510 \[29\], clause 5.4.2.2.

NOTE: When multiple NRFs are deployed in a network, the NRF used as
authorization server is the same NRF that the NF Service Consumer used
for discovering the Namf\_EventExposure service.

The Namf\_EventExposure API defines scopes for OAuth2 authorization as
specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 \[27\]; it defines a single scope consisting
on the name of the service (i.e., \"namf-evts\"), and it does not define
any additional scopes at resource or operation level.

### 6.2.10 HTTP redirection

An HTTP request may be redirected to a different AMF service instance,
within the same AMF or a different AMF of an AMF set, e.g. when an AMF
service instance is part of an AMF (service) set or when using indirect
communications (see 3GPP TS 29.500 \[4\]). See the ES3XX feature in
clause 6.2.8.

An SCP that reselects a different AMF producer instance will return the
NF Instance ID of the new AMF producer instance in the
3gpp-Sbi-Producer-Id header, as specified in clause 6.10.3.4 of 3GPP TS
29.500 \[4\].

If an AMF within an AMF set redirects a service request to a different
AMF of the set using an 307 Temporary Redirect or 308 Permanent Redirect
status code, the identity of the new AMF towards which the service
request is redirected shall be indicated in the 3gpp-Sbi-Target-Nf-Id
header of the 307 Temporary Redirect or 308 Permanent Redirect response
as specified in clause 6.10.9.1 of 3GPP TS 29.500 \[4\].

6.3 Namf\_MT Service API
------------------------

### 6.3.1 API URI

The Namf\_MT shall use the Namf\_MT API.

The API URI of the Namf\_MT API shall be:

**{apiRoot}/\<apiName\>/\<apiVersion\>/**

The request URI used in HTTP requests from the NF service consumer
towards the NF service producer shall have the Resource URI structure
defined in clause 4.4.1 of 3GPP TS 29.501 \[5\], i.e.:

**{apiRoot}/\<apiName\>/\<apiVersion\>/\<apiSpecificResourceUriPart\>**

with the following components:

\- The {apiRoot} shall be set as described in 3GPP TS 29.501 \[5\].

\- The \<apiName\> shall be \"namf-mt\".

\- The \<apiVersion\> shall be \"v1\".

\- The \<apiSpecificResourceUriPart\> shall be set as described in
clause 6.3.3.

### 6.3.2 Usage of HTTP

#### 6.3.2.1 General

HTTP/2, as defined in IETF RFC 7540 \[19\], shall be used as specified
in clause 5 of 3GPP TS 29.500 \[4\].

HTTP/2 shall be transported as specified in clause 5.3 of
3GPP TS 29.500 \[4\].

HTTP messages and bodies for the Namf\_MT service shall comply with the
OpenAPI \[23\] specification contained in Annex A.

#### 6.3.2.2 HTTP standard headers

##### 6.3.2.2.1 General

The usage of HTTP standard headers shall be supported as specified in
clause 5.2.2 of 3GPP TS 29.500 \[4\].

##### 6.3.2.2.2 Content type

The following content types shall be supported:

\- JSON, as defined in IETF RFC 8259 \[8\], shall be used as content
type of the HTTP bodies specified in the present specification as
indicated in clause 5.4 of 3GPP TS 29.500 \[4\].

\- The Problem Details JSON Object (IETF RFC 7807 \[36\]). The use of
the Problem Details JSON object in a HTTP response body shall be
signalled by the content type \"application/problem+json\".

#### 6.3.2.3 HTTP custom headers

##### 6.3.2.3.1 General

In this release of this specification, no custom headers specific to the
Namf\_MT service are defined. For 3GPP specific HTTP custom headers used
across all service based interfaces, see clause 5.2.3 of
3GPP TS 29.500 \[4\].

### 6.3.9 Security

As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.501 \[27\], the access to the Namf\_MT API
may be authorized by means of the OAuth2 protocol (see
IETF RFC 6749 \[28\]), using the \"Client Credentials\" authorization
grant, where the NRF (see 3GPP TS 29.510 \[29\]) plays the role of the
authorization server.

If Oauth2 authorization is used, an NF Service Consumer, prior to
consuming services offered by the Namf\_MT API, shall obtain a \"token\"
from the authorization server, by invoking the Access Token Request
service, as described in 3GPP TS 29.510 \[29\], clause 5.4.2.2.

NOTE: When multiple NRFs are deployed in a network, the NRF used as
authorization server is the same NRF that the NF Service Consumer used
for discovering the Namf\_MT service.

The Namf\_MT API defines scopes for OAuth2 authorization as specified in
3GPP TS 33.501 \[27\]; it defines a single scope consisting on the name
of the service (i.e., \"namf-mt\"), and it does not define any
additional scopes at resource or operation level.

### 6.3.10 HTTP redirection

An HTTP request may be redirected to a different AMF service instance,
within the same AMF or a different AMF of an AMF set, e.g. when an AMF
service instance is part of an AMF (service) set or when using indirect
communications (see 3GPP TS 29.500 \[4\]). See the ES3XX feature in
clause 6.3.8.

An SCP that reselects a different AMF producer instance will return the
NF Instance ID of the new AMF producer instance in the
3gpp-Sbi-Producer-Id header, as specified in clause 6.10.3.4 of 3GPP TS
29.500 \[4\].

If an AMF within an AMF set redirects a service request to a different
AMF of the set using an 307 Temporary Redirect or 308 Permanent Redirect
status code, the identity of the new AMF towards which the service
request is redirected shall be indicated in the 3gpp-Sbi-Target-Nf-Id
header of the 307 Temporary Redirect or 308 Permanent Redirect response
as specified in clause 6.10.9.1 of 3GPP TS 29.500 \[4\].

6.4 Namf\_Location Service API
------------------------------

### 6.4.1 API URI

The Namf\_Location shall use the Namf\_ Location API.

The API URI of the Namf\_Location API shall be:

**{apiRoot}/\<apiName\>/\<apiVersion\>/**

The request URI used in HTTP requests from the NF service consumer
towards the NF service producer shall have the Resource URI structure
defined in clause 4.4.1 of 3GPP TS 29.501 \[5\], i.e.:

**{apiRoot}/\<apiName\>/\<apiVersion\>/\<apiSpecificResourceUriPart\>**

with the following components:

\- The {apiRoot} shall be set as described in 3GPP TS 29.501 \[5\].

\- The \<apiName\> shall be \"namf-loc\".

\- The \<apiVersion\> shall be \"v1\".

\- The \<apiSpecificResourceUriPart\> shall be set as described in
clause 6.4.3.

### 6.4.2 Usage of HTTP

#### 6.4.2.1 General

HTTP/2, as defined in IETF RFC 7540 \[19\], shall be used as specified
in clause 5 of 3GPP TS 29.500 \[4\].

HTTP/2 shall be transported as specified in clause 5.3 of
3GPP TS 29.500 \[4\].

HTTP messages and bodies for the Namf\_Location service shall comply
with the OpenAPI \[23\] specification contained in Annex A.

#### 6.4.2.2 HTTP standard headers

##### 6.4.2.2.1 General

The usage of HTTP standard headers shall be supported as specified in
clause 5.2.2 of 3GPP TS 29.500 \[4\].

##### 6.4.2.2.2 Content type

The following content types shall be supported:

\- JSON, as defined in IETF RFC 8259 \[8\], shall be used as content
type of the HTTP bodies specified in the present specification as
indicated in clause 5.4 of 3GPP TS 29.500 \[4\].

\- The Problem Details JSON Object (IETF RFC 7807 \[36\]). The use of
the Problem Details JSON object in a HTTP response body shall be
signalled by the content type \"application/problem+json\".

#### 6.4.2.3 HTTP custom headers

##### 6.4.2.3.1 General

In this release of this specification, no custom headers specific to the
Namf\_Location service are defined. For 3GPP specific HTTP custom
headers used across all service based interfaces, see clause 5.2.3 of
3GPP TS 29.500 \[4\].

### 6.4.9 Security

As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.501 \[27\], the access to the Namf\_Location
API may be authorized by means of the OAuth2 protocol (see
IETF RFC 6749 \[28\]), using the \"Client Credentials\" authorization
grant, where the NRF (see 3GPP TS 29.510 \[29\]) plays the role of the
authorization server.

If Oauth2 authorization is used, an NF Service Consumer, prior to
consuming services offered by the Namf\_Location API, shall obtain a
\"token\" from the authorization server, by invoking the Access Token
Request service, as described in 3GPP TS 29.510 \[29\], clause 5.4.2.2.

NOTE: When multiple NRFs are deployed in a network, the NRF used as
authorization server is the same NRF that the NF Service Consumer used
for discovering the Namf\_Location service.

The Namf\_Location API defines scopes for OAuth2 authorization as
specified in 3GPP TS 33.501 \[27\]; it defines a single scope consisting
on the name of the service (i.e., \"namf-loc\"), and it does not define
any additional scopes at resource or operation level.

### 6.4.10 HTTP redirection

An HTTP request may be redirected to a different AMF service instance,
within the same AMF or a different AMF of an AMF set, e.g. when an AMF
service instance is part of an AMF (service) set or when using indirect
communications (see 3GPP TS 29.500 \[4\]). See the ES3XX feature in
clause 6.4.8.

An SCP that reselects a different AMF producer instance will return the
NF Instance ID of the new AMF producer instance in the
3gpp-Sbi-Producer-Id header, as specified in clause 6.10.3.4 of 3GPP TS
29.500 \[4\].

If an AMF within an AMF set redirects a service request to a different
AMF of the set using an 307 Temporary Redirect or 308 Permanent Redirect
status code, the identity of the new AMF towards which the service
request is redirected shall be indicated in the 3gpp-Sbi-Target-Nf-Id
header of the 307 Temporary Redirect or 308 Permanent Redirect response
as specified in clause 6.10.9.1 of 3GPP TS 29.500 \[4\].

######## Annex A (normative): OpenAPI specification

A.1 General
===========

This Annex specifies the API definition of the service provided by AMF
in this document. The APIs are defined by OpenAPI 3.0.0 specifications
in YAML format, following guidelines in 3GPP TS 29.501 \[5\].

The APIs for specified for following services:

\- Namf\_Communication Service

\- Namf\_EventExposure Service

\- Namf\_MT Service

\- Namf\_Location Service

This Annex takes precedence when being discrepant to other parts of the
specification with respect to the encoding of information elements and
methods within the API(s).

NOTE : The semantics and procedures, as well as conditions, e.g. for the
applicability and allowed combinations of attributes or values, not
expressed in the OpenAPI definitions but defined in other parts of the
specification also apply.

Informative copies of the OpenAPI specification files contained in this
3GPP Technical Specification are available on a Git-based repository,
that uses the GitLab software version control system (see
3GPP TS 29.501 \[5\] clause 5.3.1 and 3GPP TR 21.900 \[37\] clause 5B).
