Foreword
========

This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).

The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:

Version x.y.z

where:

x the first digit:

1 presented to TSG for information;

2 presented to TSG for approval;

3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.

y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

1 Scope
=======

CS Fallback in the Evolved Packet System (EPS) enables the provisioning
of CS-domain services (e.g. voice call, Location Services (LCS) or
supplementary services) by reuse of CS infrastructure when the UE is
served by E-UTRAN. Additionally, SMS delivery via the CS core network is
realized without CS fallback.

The present document specifies the procedures and the SGs Application
Part (SGsAP) messages used on the SGs interface between the Mobility
Management Entity (MME) in the EPS and the Visitor Location Register
(VLR), to allow location management coordination and to relay certain
messages related to GSM circuit switched services over the EPS system.

The present document also specifies the use of Stream Control
Transmission Protocol (SCTP) for the transport of SGsAP messages.

The present document is applicable to the MME in the EPS and to the VLR.
The functional split between the MME and the VLR is defined in
3GPP TS 23.272 \[7\].

4 Description of the SGs association between a VLR and an MME
=============================================================

4.1 General
-----------

CS fallback function and SMS delivery via the CS core network is
realized by reusing Gs interface mechanisms as defined in
3GPP TS 29.018 \[16\] on the interface between the MME in the EPS and
the VLR. This interface is called SGs interface.

NOTE: Within this specification, the term VLR refers to MSC/VLR or MSC
Server/VLR.

The SGs interface connects the databases in the VLR and the MME. The
procedures described in the present document are used to co-ordinate the
location information of UEs that are IMSI attached to both EPS and
non-EPS services. The SGs interface is also used to convey some circuit
switched related procedures via the MME.

The basis for the interworking between a VLR and an MME is the existence
of a SGs association between those entities per UE. The SGs association
is applicable to UEs which are configured to use CS fallback and SMS
over SGs, or SMS over SGs only. The SGs association is not applicable if
the subscriber data indicates that the subscription is for packet only.
The SGs association is also not applicable if the MME is registered for
SMS for the UE as specified in 3GPP TS 23.272 \[7\].

In NB-S1 mode, the SGs association is also applicable to UEs supports
NB-S1 mode only to use SMS over SGs only.

The behaviour of the VLR and the MME entities related to the SGs
interface are defined by the state of the SGs association for a UE.
Individual SGs association states are maintained at both the VLR and the
MME for each UE.

4.2 SGs association at the VLR
------------------------------

### 4.2.1 General

The states associated to the SGs interface in the VLR are specified in
subclause 4.2.2 and the state diagram at the VLR is shown in
figure 4.2.2.1. The state diagram does not include the message error
handling specified in clause 7.

### 4.2.2 States at the VLR

SGs-NULL

> There is no SGs association with an MME for the UE and therefore the
> VLR considers that the UE is IMSI detached for EPS services. In this
> state no SGsAP-MM-INFORMATION-REQUEST messages are sent to the MME.
> The VLR may initiate paging on the SGs interface if the \"Confirmed by
> Radio Contact\" restoration indicator in the VLR is set to \"false\"
> (see 3GPP TS 23.007 \[4\]). Any message from the MME is ignored except
> SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST, SGsAP-IMSI-DETACH-INDICATION and
> SGsAP-EPS-DETACH-INDICATION.

LA-UPDATE-PRESENT

> The VLR has received an SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message from the
> MME. In this state, the VLR may be waiting for the outcome of the
> Update Location procedure from the HSS, if the IMSI is not known in
> the VLR. For UEs which are configured to use CS fallback and SMS over
> SGs, or SMS over SGs only, the VLR sends SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST messages
> via the SGs interface.

SGs-ASSOCIATED

> The VLR considers that the UE is attached to both EPS and non-EPS
> services. For UEs which are configured to use CS fallback and SMS over
> SGs, or SMS over SGs only, the VLR sends SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST messages
> via the SGs interface. The VLR can perform the MM information
> procedure.

NOTE: Receipt of an SGsAP-RESET-INDICATION message from the MME may
change or not the state of the SGs interface of all the associations
associated to the restarted MME, see subclause 5.8.3.

Figure 4.2.2.1: State diagram at the VLR

4.3 SGs association at the MME
------------------------------

### 4.3.1 General

The MM context variables associated to the SGs interface in the MME are
specified in subclause 4.3.2 and states associated to the SGs interface
in the MME are specified in subclause 4.3.3. The state diagram at the
MME is shown in figure 4.3.3.1. The state diagram does not include the
message error handling specified in clause 7.

### 4.3.2 MM context variables at the MME

VLR-Reliable:

Boolean set to \"false\" when the MME has received a reset indication
from the VLR. The MME may:

\- upon reception of a combined tracking area update request from a UE
that is still attached for non-EPS services, perform immediately the
location update for non-EPS services procedure; or

\- upon reception of a periodic tracking area update request from a UE
that is still attached for non-EPS services, dependent on network
configuration and operator policy,

\- perform a network initiated detach with detach type \"IMSI detach\"
immediately after the completion of the periodic tracking area update
procedure; or

\- perform immediately the location update for non-EPS services
procedure.

MME-Reset:

> Boolean set to \"true\" when the MME restarts after a failure. The
> \"MME-Reset\" restoration indicator is unique within an MME and it
> applies to all the MM contexts stored in the MME.

### 4.3.3 States at the MME

SGs-NULL

> There is no SGs association with a VLR for the UE and therefore the
> MME considers that the UE is IMSI detached for non-EPS services. In
> this state the MME accepts SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST messages to UEs only
> if:

\- the \"MME-Reset\" restoration indicator in the MME is set to
\"true\"; or

\- the MME supports the CS restoration indicator set in the Additional
paging indicators information element in the SGs-PAGING-REQUEST message.

LA-UPDATE-REQUESTED

> The MME has sent an SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message to the VLR.
> In this state the MME waits for the outcome of the Update Location for
> non-EPS services procedure at the VLR before sending the response to

Figure 4.3.3.1: State diagram at the MME

### 4.3.4 State transitions in the MME without SGsAP signalling

During the tracking area update procedure or routing area update
procedure (see 3GPP TS 23.401 \[7B\]) and if the SGs association is not
SGs-NULL, the MME may change the state of the SGs association to
SGs-NULL upon receipt of a SGSN Context Acknowledge (see
3GPP TS 29.060 \[16A\]) or Context Acknowledge message without ISR
activation (see 3GPP TS 29.274 \[17A\]) from the target network.

During the inter-system handover from S1 mode to A/Gb mode or Iu mode,
or handover from S1 mode to S1 mode (see 3GPP TS 23.401 \[7B\]) and if
the SGs association is not SGs-NULL, the MME may change the state of the
SGs association to SGs-NULL upon receipt of a Forward Relocation
Complete (see 3GPP TS 29.060 \[16A\]) or Forward Relocation Complete
Notification message without ISR activation (see 3GPP TS 29.274 \[17A\])
from the target network.

If the MME receives a normal attach request, attach request for
emergency bearer services or a normal tracking area update request from
the UE in state SGs-ASSOCIATED, the MME shall change the state of the
SGs association to SGs-NULL.

If it is required by network configuration or operator policy, the MME
shall change the state of the SGs association to SGs-NULL if the
following conditions are fulfilled:

\- the MME receives an EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message with service
type set to \"mobile originating CS fallback emergency call or 1xCS
fallback emergency call\";

\- the state of the SGs association is not SGs-NULL; and

\- the MME determines that the UE is not available for PS services at
the target RAT as described in 3GPP TS 23.272 \[7\].

### 4.3.5 State transitions in the VLR without SGsAP signalling

Based on configuration, during PS to CS SRVCC from E-UTRAN (see
3GPP TS 23.216 \[26\]) and if the SGs association is not SGs-NULL, the
VLR may change the state of the SGs association to SGs-NULL upon receipt
of a Relocation Complete/Handover Complete message from target RNS/BSS.

5 Procedures for SGs
====================

5.1 Paging for non-EPS services procedure
-----------------------------------------

### 5.1.1 General description

This procedure is used by the VLR to send an SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST
message to a UE. This procedure applies to UEs that are simultaneously
attached for EPS services and non-EPS services, or for EPS services and
SMS only.

### 5.1.2 Procedures in the VLR

#### 5.1.2.1 General

The VLR shall handle the timers, queuing and retransmission for sending
the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message on the SGs interface in the same way
that it handles the sending of a PAGING message on the A or Iu
interface.

#### 5.1.2.2 Paging Initiation

When a VLR has to page a UE, the VLR shall check whether the VLR has a
SGs association for that UE. The VLR sends SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST messages
to the MME if the MME is in service and the state of the SGs association
for the UE is in any of the following states:

\- SGs-ASSOCIATED;

\- LA-UPDATE-PRESENT or

\- SGs-NULL and the \"Confirmed by Radio Contact\" restoration indicator
is set to \"false\".

If the VLR detects that the MME serving the UE is no longer in service
and the VLR supports MT CS services delivery via an alternative MME in
the MME pool as defined in 3GPP TS 23.007 \[4\], the VLR shall send the
SGs-PAGING-REQUEST message to one alternative MME in the same MME pool.
The VLR shall set the CS restoration indicator in the Additional paging
indicators information element.

NOTE 1: The VLR can detect that an MME is no longer in service if there
are no SCTP associations in service with that MME.

The sending of the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message does not change the
state of the SGs association with the MME.

If the \"Confirmed by Radio Contact\" restoration indicator is set to
\"true\", the VLR shall include the Location area identifier information
element into the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message, otherwise (i.e. after a
VLR failure), the VLR shall not include the Location area identifier
information element. When sending the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message, the
VLR shall start timer Ts5.

If the state of the SGs association is SGs-NULL and the \"Confirmed by
Radio Contact\" restoration indicator is set to \"false\", the VLR shall
also perform a search procedure as specified in 3GPP TS 23.018 \[5\].

In this message, the VLR includes the Service indicator information
element which will be used to indicate the type of CS service. If the
SGs paging request is sent as a result of reception of Provide
Subscriber Information Request message, the VLR sets the Service
indicator information element to either \"SMS indicator\" or \"CS call
indicator\" as specified in subclause 7.2.3.5 of 3GPP TS 23.018 \[5\].
For SMS, SMS indicator is used. For all the other CS services, CS call
indicator is used.

If the network supports CSFB priority call handling (see
3GPP TS 23.272 \[7\]) and the call was received with an eMLPP priority
level indication (see 3GPP TS 24.008 \[8\], 3GPP TS 22.067 \[24\] and
3GPP TS 23.067 \[25\]), the VLR shall include the value of the received
priority level indication in the eMLPP priority information element in
the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message.

The eMLPP priority information element may be used to derive the
appropriate priority of a SCTP association for the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST
message.

If the Calling Line Identification of the service (see
3GPP TS 24.081 \[12\]) is available in the VLR, the VLR may include the
CLI information element in the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message. The
conditions specified in 3GPP TS 23.081 \[5A\] and 3GPP TS 29.011 \[15A\]
apply also here.

If the paging is due to a NW-initiated Call Independent SS procedure as
defined in 3GPP TS 24.010 \[9\], the VLR may include the SS code in the
SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message as defined in 3GPP TS 29.002 \[15\].

NOTE 2: The SS code used by the VLR does not link to a specific
supplementary service. The VLR can use any SS code defined in
3GPP TS 29.002 \[15\], in the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message.

If the paging is due to a Mobile Terminated Location Request as defined
in 3GPP TS 24.030 \[11\], the VLR shall include LCS indicator in the
SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message. Additionally, the VLR may include LCS
client identity as defined in 3GPP TS 29.002 \[15\] in the
SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message.

For Deployment Option 2 (see subclause 8.2.4a.1 of
3GPP TS 23.272 \[7\]), if the paging was due to SMS and the SM Delivery
Timer and SM Delivery Start Time IEs were received from the SMS-GMSC as
defined in 3GPP TS 29.002 \[15\], the VLR may include these IEs in the
SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message.

For Deployment Option 2 (see subclause 8.2.4a.1 of
3GPP TS 23.272 \[7\]), if the paging was due to SMS and the Maximum
Retransmission Time IE was received from the SMS-GMSC as defined in
3GPP TS 29.002 \[15\], the VLR may include the received Maximum
Retransmission Time IE in the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message.

While domain specific access control of the PS domain is ongoing, the
VLR shall be configured to send paging messages on both the SGs and the
A/Iu interface.

The VLR may apply implementation specific rules for sending the paging
on the A/Iu interface. Dependent on network configuration or operator
policy, if the UE does not respond to a first paging on SGs interface or
the VLR considers UE fallback was failed as described in
subclause 5.15.1, and A/Iu paging has not been initiated already, the
VLR shall page on the A/Iu interface.

#### 5.1.2.3 Paging Response

The VLR stops the paging procedure towards the MME on expiry of timer
Ts5 or on receipt of a SGsAP-SERVICE-REQUEST message from the MME.

On receipt of an SCCP connection establishment containing the Initial L3
message from the UE via the A or Iu interface, the VLR shall stop the
paging procedure.

Upon receiving the SGsAP-SERVICE-REQUEST message with the UE EMM mode
information element indicating \"EMM-CONNECTED\", if the Service
indicator information element in the SGsAP-SERVICE-REQUEST message
indicates \"CS call indicator\" and Call Forwarding on No Reply (CFNRy)
is activated for the subscriber, the VLR shall start the CFNRy timer as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.082 \[5B\].

If the paging response is received via the A or Iu interface from a
location area which differs from the one stored in the VLR, the VLR
shall move the SGs association to the SGs-NULL state after the UE has
been authenticated successfully.

NOTE 2: UE sends this paging response as a result of receiving paging
request with IMSI and with CN domain indicator set to \"CS\" (see
3GPP TS 24.301 \[14\]).

#### 5.1.2.4 Paging Failure

On receipt of an SGsAP-PAGING-REJECT message before the timer Ts5
expires, the VLR stops timer Ts5. If the SGs cause information element
in the SGsAP-PAGING-REJECT message does not indicate \"Mobile
terminating CS fallback call rejected by the user\", the SGs association
is moved to the SGs-NULL state and within this state the SGs association
is marked with the contents of the SGs cause information element. If the
SGs cause information element in the SGsAP-PAGING-REJECT message
indicates \"IMSI detached for EPS services\" the VLR shall send the
paging message on the A/Iu interface. If the SGs cause information
element indicates \"Mobile terminating CS fallback call rejected by the
user\", the SGs association state shall not be changed.

When the VLR receives the SGsAP-PAGING-REJECT message with the SGs cause
information element indicating \"Mobile terminating CS fallback call
rejected by the user\", the VLR shall trigger User Determined User Busy
(UDUB) as specified in 3GPP TS 24.082 \[13\].

#### 5.1.2.5 UE unreachable

On receipt of an SGsAP-UE-UNREACHABLE message before the timer Ts5
expires, the VLR stops timer Ts5, and the paging procedure for that
paging request towards the MME is stopped. The state of the SGs
association at the VLR is unchanged.

For Deployment Option 2 (see subclause 8.2.4a.1 of
3GPP TS 23.272 \[7\]), if the paging was due to SMS and the VLR included
the SM-Delivery-Timer and SM-Delivery-Start-Time IEs in the
SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST, and if the SM Buffer Request Indicator bit is set
in the Additional UE Unreachable indicators IE in the
SGsAP\_UE\_UNREACHABLE message, the VLR may buffer the Short Message
until the time indicated in the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST or until receipt of
any earlier SGsAP message for the UE.

For Deployment Option 2 (see subclause 8.2.4a.1 of
3GPP TS 23.272 \[7\]), if the Retransmission Time IE was included in the
SGsAP-UE-UNREACHABLE message, the VLR may forward the received Requested
Retransmission Time IE to the SMS-GMSC as defined in
3GPP TS 29.002 \[15\]. In this case, the VLR shall not set the MNRF
flag.

NOTE 1: A/Iu paging can be ongoing.

NOTE 2: If the VLR considers the paging procedure completed, and no
response from the UE has been received, and CFNRc has been configured
and activated for the terminating UE, the VLR applies the equivalent
handling as for Call Forwarding on Not Reachable, as specified in
3GPP TS 23.082 \[5B\] and 3GPP TS 29.011 \[15A\].

### 5.1.3 Procedures in the MME

#### 5.1.3.1 General

The MME accepts SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST messages in any state of the SGs
association. In the SGs-NULL state, the MME accepts SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST
messages only if:

\- the \"MME-Reset\" restoration indicator is set to \"true\"; or

\- the MME supports MT CS services delivery via an alternative MME in
the MME pool as defined in 3GPP TS 23.007 \[4\] and the CS restoration
indicator is set in the Additional paging indicators information element
in the SGs-PAGING-REQUEST message.

When a MME receives a SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message from a VLR, the MME
shall first check if the UE is known by the MME. The handling of the
paging request depends on the state of the SGs association, the EMM
context variables at the MME, and the Service indicator information
element in the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message. The MME shall process the
paging request and subsequent SGs procedures related to this request
preferentially compared to other normal procedures if the
SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message includes the eMLPP priority information
element and if the MME determines the CS call has high priority based on
the received value in the eMLPP priority information element (see
3GPP TS 23.272 \[7\]).

If the Service indicator information element in the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST
message indicates \"CS call indicator\", the MME shall handle the paging
request as follows:

a\) If the UE is known:

\- if the UE is considered to be IMSI attached for EPS services and
\"SMS only\", the MME shall return an SGsAP-PAGING-REJECT message to the
VLR indicating in the SGs cause information element \"Mobile terminating
CS fallback call rejected by the user\";

\- if the UE is considered to be IMSI attached for EPS and non-EPS
services (i.e. the SGs association is not in the state SGs-NULL), the
MME shall page the UE based on the location information stored in the
MME, i.e. in all tracking areas of the stored list. If the
SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message does not include the Location area
identifier information element, the MME may set the \"VLR-Reliable\" MM
context variable to \"false\". If ISR is activated, and in addition the
SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message does not include the Location area
identifier or the \"VLR-Reliable\" MM context variable in the MME is set
to \"false\", then the MME shall send Detach Notification (Local Detach)
message to the associated SGSN;

\- if the MME detects that the UE currently has an ongoing IMS emergency
session as specified in subclause 4.6a, 3GPP TS 23.272 \[7\], the MME
shall return an SGsAP-PAGING-REJECT message to the VLR indicating in the
SGs cause information element \"Mobile terminating CS fallback call
rejected by the user\";

\- if the MME detects that the UE currently has an EPS bearer context
with QCI=1 and the MME determines that SRVCC (as specified in
3GPP TS 23.216 \[26\]) is not supported in the network or it determines
that the UE does not support SRVCC, MME shall return SGsAP-PAGING-REJECT
message to that VLR with SGs cause information element \"Mobile
terminating CS fallback call rejected by the user\";

\- if the UE is marked as IMSI detached for EPS services or IMSI
(implicitly or explicitly) detached for non-EPS services (i.e. the state
of the SGs association is SGs-NULL):

\- if the UE is in the EMM-DEREGISTERED state (see
3GPP TS 24.301 \[14\]) and if the MME supports MT CS services delivery
via an alternative MME in the MME pool and the CS restoration indicator
is set in the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message, the MME shall send the
paging request with the location information provided by the VLR,
regardless of the value of the \"MME-Reset\" indicator. If no such
location information is provided, the MME may either page the UE in all
the tracking areas served by that MME or in the tracking areas served by
the MME and by the VLR, or reject the paging request per operator
policy;

\- otherwise, the MME shall return an SGsAP-PAGING-REJECT message to
that VLR indicating in the SGs cause information element the detach
circumstance (\"IMSI detached for EPS services\", \"IMSI detached for
non-EPS services\" or \"IMSI implicitly detached for non-EPS
services\");

\- if the UE is marked as unreachable, indicated by Paging Proceed Flag
set to \"false\", and the ISR is not activated, the MME shall return an
SGsAP-UE-UNREACHABLE message to that VLR indicating in the SGs cause
information element \"UE unreachable\". The state of the SGs association
does not change at the MME; or

\- if the UE is marked as unreachable, indicated by Paging Proceed Flag
set to \"false\", and the ISR is activated, the MME shall not return an
SGsAP-UE-UNREACHABLE message to that VLR. If the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST
message does not include the Location area identifier or the
\"VLR-Reliable\" MM context variable in the MME is set to \"false\",
then the MME shall send Detach Notification (Local Detach) message to
the associated SGSN; Otherwise the MME shall forward the paging request
to the associated SGSN, as described in 3GPP TS 29.274 \[17A\].

b\) If the UE is not known and the \"MME-Reset\" restoration indicator
at the MME is set to \"false\" and if:

\- the MME does not support MT CS services delivery via an alternative
MME in the MME pool; or

\- the MME supports MT CS services delivery via an alternative MME in
the MME pool and the CS restoration indicator is not set in the
SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message;

the MME shall handle the paging request as follows:

\- the MME shall return an SGsAP-PAGING-REJECT message to that VLR
indicating in the SGs cause information element \"IMSI unknown\".

c\) If the UE is not known and if:

\- the \"MME-Reset\" restoration indicator at the MME is set to
\"true\"; or

\- the MME supports MT CS services delivery via an alternative MME in
the MME pool and the CS restoration indicator is set in the
SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message;

the MME shall handle the paging request as follows:

\- if the MME only supports \"SMS only\", the MME shall return an
SGsAP-PAGING-REJECT message to the VLR indicating in the SGs cause
information element \"Mobile terminating CS fallback call rejected by
the user\";

\- if the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message includes the Location area
identifier information element, the MME shall page the UE in all the
tracking areas served by the MME that can be mapped to the location area
indicated in the Location area identifier information element; or

\- if the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message does not include the Location
area identifier information element, the MME may page in all the
tracking areas served by the MME, or the tracking areas served by the
MME and by the VLR or reject the paging request per operator policy.

If the Service indicator information element in the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST
message indicates \"SMS indicator\", the MME shall handle the paging
request as follows:

a\) If the UE is known:

\- if the UE is considered to be IMSI attached for EPS and non-EPS
services or IMSI attached for EPS services and \"SMS only\", the MME
shall page the UE based on the location information stored in the MME.
If the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message does not include the Location area
identifier information element, the MME may set the \"VLR-Reliable\" MM
context variable to \"false\". If the UE is using eDRX, the MME may,
subject to local operator policy, return an SGsAP-UE-UNREACHABLE message
to the VLR indicating in the SGs cause information element \"UE
temporarily unreachable\" while continuing to page the UE. If ISR is
activated, and in addition the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message does not
include the Location area identifier or the \"VLR-Reliable\" MM context
variable in the MME is set to \"false\", then the MME shall send Detach
Notification (Local Detach) message to the associated SGSN; or

NOTE 2: If location area identifier information element is included in
the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST, it is not used in paging the UE.

\- for Deployment Option 2 (see subclause 8.2.4a.1 of
3GPP TS 23.272 \[7\]), if the UE is using eDRX, the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST
message includes the SM Delivery Timer and SM Delivery Start Time IEs,
and the UE is expected to be reachable before the time indicated by the
SM-Delivery-Timer and SM-Delivery-Start-Time IEs, the MME may return an
SGsAP-UE-UNREACHABLE message to the VLR indicating in the SGs cause
information element \"UE temporarily unreachable\" and setting the SM
Buffer Request Indicator bit in the Additional UE Unreachable indicators
information element. The state of the SGs association does not change at
the MME. The MME should then page the UE when the UE is expected to be
reachable.

\- for Deployment Option 2 (see subclause 8.2.4a.1 of
3GPP TS 23.272 \[7\]), if the UE is using eDRX and the
SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message includes the Maximum Retransmission Time
IEs, the MME may return an SGsAP-UE-UNREACHABLE message to that VLR
indicating in the SGs cause information element \"UE temporarily
unreachable\" and including the Requested Retransmission Time IE. In
this case, the MME shall set the NEAF. The state of the SGs association
does not change at the MME.

NOTE 3: This mechanism does not cause additional signalling at the HLR
to retransmit the Short Message.

\- if the UE is marked as IMSI detached for EPS services or IMSI
(implicitly or explicitly) detached for non-EPS services, or as
unreachable, the MME shall proceed as specified for the case when the
service indicator indicates \"CS call indicator\".

b\) If the UE is not known and the \"MME-Reset\" restoration indicator
at the MME is set to \"false\" and if:

\- the MME does not support MT CS services delivery via an alternative
MME in the MME pool; or

\- the MME supports MT CS services delivery via an alternative MME in
the MME pool and the CS restoration indicator is not set in the
SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message;

the MME shall handle the paging request as follows:

\- the MME shall return an SGsAP-PAGING-REJECT message to that VLR
indicating in the SGs cause information element \"IMSI unknown\".

c\) If the UE is not known and if:

\- the \"MME-Reset\" restoration indicator at the MME is set to
\"true\"; or

\- the MME supports MT CS services delivery via an alternative MME in
the MME pool and the CS restoration indicator is set in the
SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message;

the MME shall handle the paging request as follows:

> \- if the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message includes the Location area
> identifier information element, the MME shall page the UE in all the
> tracking areas served by the MME that can be mapped to the location

#### 5.1.3.2 Procedure when no NAS signalling connection exists

If the Service indicator information element in the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST
message indicates \"CS call indicator\" and the MME accepts the paging
request, the MME shall proceed as follows:

\- If the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message includes the Location area
identifier and the \"VLR-Reliable\" MM context variable in the MME is
set to \"true\":

\- if the UE is considered to be IMSI attached for EPS and non-EPS
services, the MME pages the UE with CN domain indicator set to \"CS\".

if

\- the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message includes the IMSI without TMSI and
the location area stored in the MME is the same as the one received in
the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message and S-TMSI can be retrieved, and the
operator's policy allows the use of S-TMSI as paging address; or

NOTE: The operator's policy is related to MSC pool in target RAT.

\- the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message includes the TMSI and the location
area stored in the MME is the same as the one received in the
SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message;

then the MME uses the S-TMSI as paging address at the radio interface;
else the MME uses the IMSI; and

\- if the UE is not known, or is marked as IMSI detached for EPS
services or IMSI (implicitly or explicitly) detached for non-EPS
services, the MME pages the UE with IMSI and CN domain indicator set to
\"PS\".

\- If the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message does not include the Location
area identifier, or the \"VLR-Reliable\" MM context variable in the MME
is set to \"false\":

\- if the UE is considered to be IMSI attached for EPS and non-EPS
services, the MME uses IMSI as a paging address at the radio interface
and CN domain indicator set to \"CS\". When the MME receives the paging
response from the UE, the MME requests the UE to re-attach for non-EPS
services as described in 3GPP TS 24.301 \[14\]; and

\- if the UE is not known, or is marked as IMSI detached for EPS
services or IMSI (implicitly or explicitly) detached for non-EPS
services, the MME pages the UE with IMSI with CN domain indicator set to
\"PS\" to force the UE to re-attach to EPS and non-EPS services as
described in 3GPP TS 24.301 \[14\].

If the Service indicator information element in the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST
message indicates \"SMS indicator\" and the MME accepts the paging
request, the MME shall proceed as follows:

\- If the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message includes the Location area
identifier and the \"VLR-Reliable\" MM context variable in the MME is
set to \"true\":

\- if the UE is considered to be IMSI attached for EPS and non-EPS
services or IMSI attached for EPS services and \"SMS only\", the MME
shall use the S-TMSI as paging address at the radio interface with CN
domain indicator set to \"PS\". The MME takes action as described in
3GPP TS 24.301 \[14\], subclause 5.6.2.4; and

\- if the UE is not known, or is marked as IMSI detached for EPS
services or IMSI (implicitly or explicitly) detached for non-EPS
services, the MME pages the UE with IMSI as paging address at the radio
interface with CN domain indicator set to \"PS\". The MME takes action
as described in 3GPP TS 24.301 \[14\], subclause 5.6.2.4.

\- If the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message does not include the Location
area identifier information element or the \"VLR-Reliable\" MM context
variable is set to \"false\":

\- if the UE is considered to be IMSI attached for EPS and non-EPS
services or IMSI attached for EPS services and for \"SMS only\", the MME
uses S-TMSI as paging address at the radio interface with CN domain
indicator set to \"PS\". When the MME receives the paging response from
the UE, the MME requests the UE to re-attach for non-EPS services as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 \[14\]; and

\- if the UE is not known, or is marked as IMSI detached for EPS
services or IMSI (implicitly or explicitly) detached for non-EPS
services, the MME pages the UE with IMSI with CN domain indicator set to
\"PS\" to force the UE to re-attach to EPS and non-EPS services as
described in 3GPP TS 24.301 \[14\].

Independent of the Service indicator information element, if the MME has
activated Idle mode Signalling Reduction for the UE, the MME shall
forward the paging request to the associated SGSN, as described in
3GPP TS 29.274 \[17A\].

Independent of the Service indicator information element, the MME shall
not retransmit the paging message to the UE. Additionally, if the MME
has activated Idle mode Signalling Reduction for the UE, the MME shall
not retransmit the paging request to the associated SGSN.

#### 5.1.3.3 Procedure when a NAS signalling connection exists

If the Service indicator information element in the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST
message indicates \"CS call indicator\" and the MME accepts the paging
request, the MME shall proceed as follows:

\- The MME requests the UE to re-attach for non-EPS services as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 \[14\] if the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message
does not include the Location area identifier, or the \"VLR-Reliable\"
MM context variable in the MME is set to \"false\"; and

\- otherwise, the MME sends the CS SERVICE NOTIFICATION message to the
UE through the NAS signalling connection, including the CS service
related parameters (CLI, SS code, LCS indicator and LCS client
identity), received from the VLR.

If the Service indicator information element in the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST
message indicates \"SMS indicator\" and the MME accepts the paging
request, the MME shall proceed as follows:

\- If the Location area identifier information element is not included
in the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message or the \"VLR-Reliable\" MM context
variable is set to \"false\", the MME requests the UE to re-attach for
non-EPS services as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 \[14\]; and

\- otherwise, the MME need not take any action towards the UE.

5.2 Location update for non-EPS services procedure
--------------------------------------------------

### 5.2.1 General description

The location update for non-EPS services procedure is a general
procedure used by UEs which are configured to use CS fallback and SMS
over SGs, or SMS over SGs only. This procedure is not performed if:

\- the subscriber data indicates that the subscription is for packet
only; or

\- the MME is registered for SMS for the UE (see 3GPP TS 23.272 \[7\]).

NOTE: For the cases specified above, the registration with a VLR is not
required and the MME does not initiate the location update for non-EPS
services procedure.

This procedure allows UEs and the network to perform:

\- combined IMSI attach for EPS and non-EPS services or for SMS only;

\- IMSI attach for non-EPS services or for SMS only if the UE is already
IMSI attached for EPS services;

\- normal location update procedure to the VLR if the UE is IMSI
attached for both EPS and non-EPS services, or for SMS only; or

\- allocation of new TMSI to an UE.

The location update for non-EPS services procedure in the SGs interface
is always started as a consequence of a direct action from the UE. The
combined attach and tracking area update procedures are further
specified in 3GPP TS 23.272 \[7\] and 3GPP TS 24.301 \[14\].

When a UE is IMSI attached for EPS and non-EPS services, the VLR shall
stop any implicit detach timer. Instead the MME uses the \"Paging
Proceed Flag\" to determine the likely availability of the UE to the
network. Upon reception of the periodic Tracking Area Update message,
the MME does not report to the VLR, and the MME shall not change the
state of the SGs association. When the UE performs a detach only for EPS
services or the MME performs an implicit detach for EPS services, and
the VLR\'s implicit detach timer is not already running, the EPS detach
indication to the VLR shall cause the VLR\'s implicit detach timer to be
restarted from its initial value.

If the MME performs an implicit detach for both EPS and non-EPS
services, then the MME shall send to the VLR an
SGsAP-IMSI-DETACH-INDICATION message with cause \"Implicit network
initiated IMSI detach from EPS and non-EPS services\", as further
described in subclause 5.6 (the implicit IMSI detach message indicates
that the UE is unavailable for both EPS and non-EPS services).

### 5.2.2 Procedures in the MME

#### 5.2.2.1 General

The location update for non-EPS services procedure is initiated with a
combined attach or a combined tracking area update procedure. On receipt
of an ATTACH REQUEST message or a TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message
from the UE, the MME handles the EPS related request as specified in
3GPP TS 24.301 \[14\].

When the MME receives the Update Location Answer message containing
subscription data from the HSS, the MME determines whether it needs to
perform location update for non-EPS services procedure. For the cases
identified below, if the MME is configured with ability not to perform
registrations with a VLR for the UE, the MME sends response message to
the UE without starting the location update for non-EPS services
procedure:

\- if the Network Access Mode (NAM) subscription data indicates that the
subscription is for packet only (see 3GPP TS 29.272 \[17\]); or

\- if the Network Access Mode (NAM) subscription data indicates that the
subscription is for packet and circuit (see 3GPP TS 29.272 \[17\]) and
the MME is registered for SMS as specified in annex C of
3GPP TS 23.272 \[7\] for this UE.

NOTE 1: When the MME supports both SMS in MME feature and SMS over SGs,
depending on UE capability and/or network configuration and/or "PS and
SMS only" subscription, it can be preferred to provide SMS services via
SMS in MME to avoid the VLR registration.

Otherwise, the MME shall start the location update for non-EPS services
procedure and shall wait for the outcome of both location update
procedures towards the VLR and the HSS before sending the response
message to the UE.

NOTE 2: When the combined attach or tracking area update procedure is
for both EPS services and non-EPS services and the MME is not registered
for SMS for the UE (see 3GPP TS 23.272 \[7\]) and the UE has \"PS and
SMS only\" subscription, the MME starts the location update for non-EPS
services procedure for SMS over SGs only.

#### 5.2.2.2 Location update initiation

##### 5.2.2.2.1 General

If timer Ts6-1 is not running, the MME shall start the location update
for non-EPS services procedure when it receives from the UE:

\- an attach request indicating combined EPS/IMSI attach;

\- a combined tracking area update request indicating Combined TA/LA
updating with IMSI attach;

\- a combined tracking area update request and the MME detects that the
LAI has changed;

\- a combined tracking area update request and the state of the SGs
association is SGs-NULL; or

\- a combined tracking area update request and the MME serving the UE
has changed.

If timer Ts6-1 is not running, the MME may start the location update for
non-EPS services procedure when it receives from the UE:

\- a combined tracking area update request or a periodic tracking area
update , if the MM context variable \"VLR-Reliable\" for the UE is set
to \"false\" (see subclause 5.7.3).

If multiple PLMNs are available for the CS domain, the MME shall select
a PLMN for CS domain as specified in 3GPP TS 23.272 \[7\]. If the MME
cannot select any PLMN for CS domain for the UE, the MME informs the UE
that the CS domain is not available.

The MME shall determine the new location area identification as follows:

\- if the MME received a combined attach request or combined tracking
area update request from the UE with an indication for \"SMS only\", or
the network only supports \"SMS only\" or the network only has a few
VLRs that support SGs interface, the MME may allocate a default location
area identification specifically configured for that case;

\- else the MME derives the location area identification from the
current tracking area identity where the UE is located. For this the MME
may take any access restrictions provided by the HSS into account, if
the network is using separate location areas for GERAN and UTRAN cells.

The MME shall derive the VLR name from the location area identification
which was determined. For networks supporting the feature \'Intra Domain
Connection of RAN Nodes to Multiple CN Nodes\', the VLR name is derived
as described in 3GPP TS 23.236 \[6A\].The MME shall include the location
area identification in the new location area identifier information
element in the SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message.

NOTE 1: The selection of the VLR in the MME follows the same rule as the
selection of the VLR in the SGSN, as defined in 3GPP TS 23.236 \[6A\].

In networks supporting the feature \'Intra Domain Connection of RAN
Nodes to Multiple CN Nodes\' (3GPP TS 23.236 \[6A\]), if the TMSI based
NRI container is not received from the UE, and the MME determines that
the serving VLR of the UE is changed, the MME shall include in the Old
location area identifier a specific LAI value which is not broadcasted
in the network and not associated with any VLR.

NOTE 2: The MME determines that the serving VLR of the UE is changed
when the SGs association changes from one serving VLR to a different
one, or based on implementation dependent criteria.

NOTE 3: When the VLR receives the SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message
with the specific LAI value, the VLR retrieves the MM context of the UE
from the HLR.

In networks supporting the feature \"Intra Domain Connection of RAN
Nodes to Multiple CN Nodes\" as defined in 3GPP TS 23.236 \[6A\], the
MME shall support load re-distribution of UEs to another VLR than the
current one. When the MME receives a periodic tracking area update
request or a combined tracking area update request, the MME shall check
whether for this UE there is a SGs association to a VLR for which load
re-distribution has been initiated in the MME by O&M. If this is the
case and

\- if a combined tracking area update request is received, the MME shall
derive the new VLR name as described in 3GPP TS 23.236 \[6A\] and then
send the SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message to the new selected VLR;
or

\- if a periodic tracking area update request is received, dependent on
network configuration and operator policy, the MME shall take one of the
following actions:

\- perform a network initiated detach with detach type \"IMSI detach\"
immediately after the completion of the periodic tracking area update
procedure; or

\- derive the new VLR name as described in 3GPP TS 23.236 \[6A\] and
then send the SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message to the new selected
VLR.

If the VLR is configured for gateway core network (GWCN), the MME shall
select a CS domain operator as specified in 3GPP TS 23.272 \[7\] and
proceed as follows:

\- If the preferred RAT of the selected CS domain operator is GERAN and
the UE does not support GERAN network sharing (see 3GPP TS 24.008 \[8\],
subclause 10.5.5.12), the MME shall include the selected CS domain
operator in the selected CS domain operator information element, and the
common PLMN in the new location area identifier information element in
the SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message; or

\- If only common PLMN ID and no multiple PLMN IDs are provided in CS
domain for selection by the UE (see 3GPP TS 23.251 \[7A\],
subclause 4.2.3.1), the MME shall include the selected CS domain
operator in the selected CS domain operator information element, and the
common PLMN in the new location area identifier information element in
the SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message.

If multiple PLMN IDs are provided in CS domain for selection by the UE
and the UE supports GERAN network sharing (see 3GPP TS 24.008 \[8\],
subclause 10.5.5.12), the MME shall include the selected PLMN for CS
domain in the new location area identifier information element as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.251 \[7A\].

The SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message includes the type of location
update performed by the UE in the EPS location update type information
element. If the UE has performed a combined attach or a combined
tracking area update indicating \"combined TA/LA updating with IMSI
attach\", the MME indicates \"IMSI attach\", otherwise the MME indicates
\"Normal location update\".

The MME shall include the TMSI status in the
SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message if the UE indicates in the ATTACH
REQUEST or the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message that it has no valid
TMSI available. The MME shall also include the old location area
identifier in the SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message if the UE
included the old location area identification in the ATTACH REQUEST or
TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST message.

The MME shall include the TMSI based NRI container in the
SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message if received from the UE.

If the MME supports the \"Automatic Device Detection\" (see
3GPP TS 22.101 \[2\]) or the \"Trace for Management Based
Activation/Deactivation\" (see 3GPP TS 32.422 \[18\]), the MME shall
include the IMEISV in the SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message.

The MME shall add the UE\'s current TAI and E-CGI to the
SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message.

When the MME sends the SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST, the MME shall
start timer Ts6-1.

If timer Ts6-1 is running and the MME receives from the UE:

\- an attach request indicating combined EPS/IMSI attach; or

\- a combined tracking area update with or without IMSI attach.

Then:

\- if the LAI determined by the MME is the same as in the outstanding
request, the MME shall not process this new request and shall wait for
the VLR response to the ongoing procedure;

\- if the LAI determined by the MME is different but the VLR name is the
same as for previous LAI, any response from the VLR to the outstanding
request is ignored, the MME shall stop and reset timer Ts6-1 and the MME
shall start the location update for non-EPS services procedure; or

\- if the LAI determined by the MME is different and the VLR name is
different as for previous LAI, any response from the previously
addressed VLR to the outstanding request is ignored, the MME shall stop
and reset timer Ts6-1, and the MME shall start the location update for
non-EPS services procedure.

When the MME receives from the UE a tracking area update request and the
MME serving the UE has changed, the MME shall stop and reset
timer Ts6-1.

##### 5.2.2.2.2 VLR fails without restart

If the MME supports restoration for CS services via an alternative VLR
as defined in 3GPP TS 23.007 \[4\] and, upon reception of a combined
tracking area update request or a periodic tracking area update request
from the UE, the MME determines that the VLR serving the UE is no longer
in service, the MME may:

\- if a combined tracking area update request is received, select an
alternative VLR that is in service for the UE and immediately perform
the location update for non-EPS services procedure towards the selected
VLR as described in subclause 5.2; or

\- if a periodic tracking area update request is received, dependent on
network configuration and operator policy,

\- perform a network initiated detach with detach type \"IMSI detach\"
immediately after the completion of the periodic tracking area update
procedure and then select an alternative VLR that is in service for the
UE during the subsequent combined tracking area update procedure, before
performing the location update for non-EPS services procedure towards
the selected VLR as described in subclause 5.2; or

\- select an alternative VLR that is in service for the UE and
immediately perform the location update for non-EPS services procedure
towards the selected VLR as described in subclause 5.2.

If the MME supports restoration for CS services via an alternative VLR
as defined in 3GPP TS 23.007 \[4\] and, upon reception of an UPLINK NAS
TRANSPORT message (see 3GPP TS 24.301 \[14\]) from the UE, the MME
determines that the VLR serving the UE is no longer in service, the MME
may:

\- request the UE to re-attach for non-EPS services as specified in
3GPP TS 24.301 \[14\] and then select an alternative VLR that is in
service for the UE during the subsequent combined tracking area update
procedure, before performing the location update for non-EPS services
procedure towards the selected VLR as described in subclause 5.2.

NOTE 1: How an MME detects a VLR is no longer in service and triggers
selection of alternative VLR is implemention dependent.

NOTE 2: To avoid large amounts of UEs initiating re-attach for non-EPS
services simultaneously, the MME can ignore some MO-SMS. Selection of
MO-SMS to ignore is implementation dependent.

#### 5.2.2.3 Location update response

If the MME receives an SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-ACCEPT message from the
VLR, the MME shall stop timer Ts6-1 and:

\- move the state of the SGs association to SGs-ASSOCIATED;

\- set the MM context variable \"VLR-Reliable\" to \"true\"; and

\- indicate to the UE the acceptance of the VLR to the location update
procedure. The message sent to the UE includes the Location Area
Identity (see 3GPP TS 24.301 \[14\]).

The MME shall wait for the outcome of the location update for non-EPS
services procedure towards the VLR before sending a response to location
update procedure to the UE. When the MME receives an
SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REJECT message from the VLR, it will map the
reject cause received to the appropriate reject cause as specified in
3GPP TS 24.301 \[14\], and report this reject cause to the UE.

If the VLR included the Mobile identity information element in the
SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-ACCEPT message, the MME shall relay the
information received to the UE. If the Mobile identity information
element contains a new TMSI, this will cause the UE to perform a TMSI
reallocation procedure. In this case, the MME shall send to the VLR the
SGsAP-TMSI-REALLOCATION-COMPLETE message when the MME receives the
ATTACH COMPLETE or the TRACKING AREA UPDATE COMPLETE message from the
UE. If the Mobile identity information element contains an IMSI, this
will cause the UE to deallocate its TMSI.

#### 5.2.2.4 Location update failure

If the MME receives an SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REJECT message from the
VLR, the MME

\- shall stop timer Ts6-1;

\- shall move the state of the SGs association to SGs-NULL; and

\- indicates to the UE the rejection of the Location Update procedure by
the VLR as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 \[14\]. The Reject cause value
sent by the VLR shall be mapped to the appropriate reject cause as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 \[14\], and the latter is forwarded to the
UE.

NOTE: Upon receiving an SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REJECT message with MM
cause \#11 or MM cause \#13, if the MME is configured to know that the
VPLMN has a suitable roaming agreement for E-UTRAN with the HPLMN of the
UE, the MME can map the MM cause to EMM cause \#18 as specified in
3GPP TS 24.301 \[14\].

#### 5.2.2.5 Abnormal cases

If timer Ts6-1 expires, the MME shall abort the Location Update for
non-EPS service procedure and indicate this to the UE with the Reject
cause value \'MSC temporarily not reachable\'. The state of the SGs
association to the VLR shall be SGs-NULL.

If the MME receives an SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-ACCEPT message and timer
Ts6-1 is not running then:

\- if timer Ts8 is running (see subclause 5.4), the message shall be
ignored;

\- if timer Ts9 is running (see subclause 5.5), the message shall be
ignored; or

\- if timers Ts8 and Ts9 are not running:

\- if the state of the SGs association to the VLR is SGs-ASSOCIATED, the
message shall be ignored; or

\- if the state of the SGs association to the VLR is different than
SGs-ASSOCIATED, the message shall be treated as a message incompatible
with the protocol state of the MME (see subclause 7.3).

#### 5.2.2.6 Additional MME procedure for UE supporting NB-S1 mode only

This subclause applies when the UE supporting NB-S1 mode only requests
SMS services via a normal attach request or tracking area update
request.

If the UE supporting NB-S1 mode only requests SMS services using normal
attach request or tracking area update request, the location update for
non-EPS services procedure can be initiated by the MME when SMS over SGs
is used.

If timer Ts6-1 is not running, the MME shall start the location update
for non-EPS services procedure when it receives from the UE:

\- an attach request indicating EPS attach and \"SMS only\" in NB-S1
mode, SMS services via SMS in MME are not available and SMS over SGs is
used for the UE;

\- a tracking area update request indicating TA updating and \"SMS
only\" in NB-S1 mode, SMS services via SMS in MME are not available, SMS
over SGs is used for the UE and the MME detects that the LAI has
changed;

\- a tracking area update request indicating TA updating and \"SMS
only\" in NB-S1 mode, SMS services via SMS in MME are not available, SMS
over SGs is used for the UE and the state of the SGs association is
SGs-NULL; or

\- a tracking area update request indicating TA updating and \"SMS
only\" in NB-S1 mode, SMS services via SMS in MME are not available, SMS
over SGs is used for the UE and the MME detects that the MME serving the
UE has changed.

NOTE 1: When the MME supports both SMS in MME feature and SMS over SGs,
depending on UE capability and/or network configuration and/or \"PS and
SMS only\" subscription, it can be preferred to provide SMS services via
SMS in MME to avoid the VLR registration.

NOTE 2: The UE does not include the MS Classmark 2 IE in a normal attach
request or normal tracking area update request, and the MME does not
store this information or include it in subsequent messages to the VLR.
Services that use information part of MS Classmark 2, e.g. CAMEL, can
therefore fail when SMS over SGs is provided via normal procedures.

If the MME has a stored TMSI for the UE, the MME may include this TMSI
in the TMSI based NRI container IE in the SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST
message. Otherwise the MME shall indicate \"no valid TMSI available\" in
the TMSI status IE in the SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message.

If the MME received a normal attach request or normal tracking area
update request from the UE with an indication for \"SMS only\", the MME
may allocate a default location area identification specifically
configured for that case.

If the MME receives an SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-ACCEPT message from the
VLR, the MME shall:

\- stop timer Ts6-1 and move the state of the SGs association to
SGs-ASSOCIATED;

\- set the MM context variable \"VLR-Reliable\" to \"true\"; and

\- indicate to the UE the acceptance of SMS services as specified in
3GPP TS 24.301 \[14\].

NOTE 3: The message sent to the UE does not include the Location Area
Identity or the Mobile identity information element if received from the
VLR.

If the VLR included the Location area identifier or the Mobile identity
information element in the SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-ACCEPT message, the MME
may store the received Location area identifier or the Mobile identity
information element for the subsequent location update for non-EPS
services procedure for the UE. If the Mobile identity information
element contains a new TMSI, the MME may send to the VLR the
SGsAP-TMSI-REALLOCATION-COMPLETE message when the MME indicates to the
UE the acceptance of SMS services. If the Mobile identity information
element contains an IMSI, the MME may delete any stored TMSI for the UE.

If the MME receives an SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REJECT message from the
VLR, the MME shall:

\- stop timer Ts6-1 and move the state of the SGs association to
SGs-NULL; and

\- indicate to the UE the rejection of SMS services as specified in
3GPP TS 24.301 \[14\]. The MME maps the location update reject cause
received from the VLR to an appropriate value as specified in
3GPP TS 24.301 \[14\] and forwards to the UE.

If timer Ts6-1 expires, the MME shall abort the Location Update for
non-EPS service procedure. The MME indicates to the UE the rejection of
SMS services by setting an appropriate value and shall as specified in
3GPP TS 24.301 \[14\] and forwards to the UE. The state of the SGs
association to the VLR shall be SGs-NULL.

### 5.2.3 Procedures in the VLR

#### 5.2.3.1 General

When a VLR receives an SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message, the VLR
checks whether the IMSI is known. If the IMSI is not known, the VLR
retrieves the MM context of the UE from the HSS.

In networks supporting the feature \'Intra Domain Connection of RAN
Nodes to Multiple CN Nodes\' (3GPP TS 23.236 \[6A\]), if the TMSI based
NRI container is received in the SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message,
the VLR derives the NRI value. If the NRI value is not allocated by the
VLR, the VLR retrieves the MM context of the UE from the HSS.

When the VLR is configured for gateway core network (GWCN), the VLR
shall select the serving CS domain operator as follows:

\- If the selected CS domain operator information element is received in
the SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message, the VLR shall select the
serving CS domain operator as specified in the selected CS domain
operator information element;

\- If the selected CS domain operator information element is not
received in the SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message and the PLMN ID
included in the new location area identifier information element
identifies a CS domain operator, the VLR shall select the serving CS
domain operator as specified in the new location area identifier
information element;

\- Otherwise, the VLR selects the serving CS domain operator based on
local policies.

#### 5.2.3.2 Location update response

If the location update is accepted by the VLR and, if necessary, by the
HSS, the VLR shall:

\- move the SGs association to the SGs-ASSOCIATED state;

\- set the \"Confirmed by Radio Contact\" restoration indicator to
\"true\";

\- update the SGs association by storing the MME address included in
SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message; and

\- send an SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-ACCEPT message to the sending MME. This
message includes the location area identifier received in the New
location area identifier information element in the previous
SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message.

After the VLR has updated the SGs association, if Ts5 is still running
for a MT service for this UE, the VLR shall repeat SGs Paging Request
towards the updated SGs association.

#### 5.2.3.3 Location update failure

If the location update is rejected by the VLR, the VLR shall:

\- send an SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REJECT message to the MME with the
appropriate reject cause as indicated in 3GPP TS 24.008 \[8\] and shall
indicate to the MME the Location area identifier received in the
corresponding SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message; and

\- move the SGs association to SGs-NULL.

#### 5.2.3.4 TMSI reallocation procedure

If the VLR decides to allocate a new TMSI to the UE, the VLR shall
include the new TMSI in the SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-ACCEPT message. After
sending the SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-ACCEPT message with a new TMSI the VLR
shall start timer Ts6-2. If the VLR decides to deallocate the TMSI of
the UE, the VLR shall include the IMSI of the UE in the
SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-ACCEPT message.

Upon receipt of the SGsAP-TMSI-REALLOCATION-COMPLETE message, the VLR
shall stop the timer Ts6-2 and consider the new TMSI as valid.

If the IMSI was sent to the UE, the VLR considers the old TMSI if
available, as deleted.

If no SGsAP-TMSI-REALLOCATION-COMPLETE message is received by the VLR
before the timer Ts6-2 expires, the VLR shall abort the TMSI
reallocation procedure. The VLR shall consider the old TMSI if
available, occupied until the new TMSI is used in a subsequent A/Iu
message, or for an implementation dependent time. The outcome of the
TMSI reallocation procedure does not change the state of the SGs
association. The VLR uses the IMSI or a TMSI, either the new TMSI or the
old TMSI if available, for paging.

NOTE: Whether the new TMSI or old TMSI is used in the SGs paging request
does not impact the paging procedure or UE response.

#### 5.2.3.5 Abnormal cases

The following abnormal cases can be identified:

i\) MM signalling via A or Iu interface

> If the VLR receives a Location Update request or an IMSI detach
> indication from the UE by the A or Iu interface when the state of the
> SGs association in the VLR is not SGs-NULL, the VLR shall move the
> state of the SGs association to SGs-NULL.

ii\) Additional Location Update Request

> If the state of the SGs association in the VLR is LA-UPDATE PRESENT
> and an SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message is received, then:

\- if the message is from the same MME and indicates the same New
location area identifier information element as the outstanding location
update request, then the VLR shall ignore this additional
SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message;

\- if the message is from the same MME but indicates a different New
location area identifier information element to the outstanding location
update request, then the VLR shall treat this additional
SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message and the VLR shall not send any
response to the previous SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message; or

\- if the message is from a different MME (indicating either the same or
different New location area identifier information element) to the
outstanding location update request, then the VLR shall treat this
additional SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message and the VLR shall not
send any response to the previous SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message.

iii\) Detach signalling from the MME

> If the state of the SGs association in the VLR is LA-UPDATE PRESENT
> and either an SGsAP-EPS-DETACH-INDICATION or an
> SGsAP-IMSI-DETACH-INDICATION message is received, then the VLR shall
> abandon the Location Update for non-EPS services procedure (neither an
> SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-ACCEPT nor an SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REJECT
> messages is sent) and the further actions described in
> subclauses 5.4 or 5.5 or 5.6 are followed.

iv\) Signalling via Gs interface

> If the VLR receives for a UE a BSSAP+-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message
> (as defined in 3GPP TS 29.018 \[16\]) from an SGSN when the state of
> the SGs association for this UE in the VLR is not SGs-NULL, the VLR
> shall move the state of the SGs association to SGs-NULL.

v\) New Location Update Request during TMSI reallocation procedure

If the VLR receives an SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REQUEST message while Ts6-2
is running, the VLR shall stop timer Ts6-2, abort the TMSI reallocation
procedure and proceed with the new location update for non-EPS services
procedure. If the VLR needs to page the MS during the new location
update for non-EPS services procedure, the VLR uses the IMSI or a TMSI,
either the new TMSI from the aborted TMSI reallocation procedure or the
old TMSI if available, for paging.

NOTE: Whether the new TMSI or old TMSI is used in the SGs paging request
does not impact the paging procedure or UE response.

vi\) Reset signalling from the MME

If the state of the SGs association in the VLR is LA-UPDATE PRESENT and
an SGsAP-RESET-INDICATION message is received from the MME, then the VLR
shall abandon the Location Update for non-EPS services procedure
(neither an SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-ACCEPT nor an
SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATE-REJECT messages is sent) and the further actions
described in subclause 5.8 are followed.

vii\) Collision between A or Iu paging and Location Update Request

If the VLR receives Location Update Request when A or Iu paging is
ongoing, then the VLR may abort paging procedure over A or Iu interface
and may initiate paging procedure over SGs interface after location
updating procedure has successfully completed.

5.3 Non-EPS alert procedure
---------------------------

### 5.3.1 General description

This procedure is used by the VLR to request from an MME an indication
when any signalling activity from the UE is detected. This procedure can
be invoked at any time by the VLR. The MME shall acknowledge the
SGsAP-ALERT-REQUEST message.

### 5.3.2 Procedures in the VLR

#### 5.3.2.1 Alert Initiation

The VLR may start the Non-EPS alert procedure at any time. When the VLR
wants to request from an MME that further activity from a UE is reported
by the MME, the VLR shall send an SGsAP-ALERT-REQUEST message to that
MME. The VLR starts timer Ts7 when the SGsAP-ALERT-REQUEST message is
sent.

#### 5.3.2.2 Alert Response

When an SGsAP-ALERT-ACK message is received, the VLR shall stop the
timer Ts7. The state of the SGs association is not changed.

#### 5.3.2.3 Alert Failure

If an SGsAP-ALERT-REJECT message is received, the VLR shall stop the
timer Ts7, move the state of the SGs association to SGs-NULL and within
this state the SGs association is marked with the contents of the SGs
cause information element.

#### 5.3.2.4 Alert Indication

The VLR shall not change the state of the SGs association upon reception
of an SGsAP-UE-ACTIVITY-INDICATION message.

For Deployment Option 2 (see subclause 8.2.4a.1 of
3GPP TS 23.272 \[7\]), if the SGsAP-UE-ACTIVITY-INDICATION message
includes the Maximum UE Availability Time IE and the MNRF flag is set in
the VLR, the VLR may forward the Maximum UE Availability Time IE to the
HLR as defined in 3GPP TS 29.002 \[15\].

#### 5.3.2.5 Abnormal cases

If no SGsAP-ALERT-ACK message is received before the timer Ts7 expires,
the VLR shall retransmit the SGsAP-ALERT-REQUEST message a maximum of
Ns7 times.

NOTE: If no SGsAP-ALERT-ACK message is received after that, a report is
made to the O&M system. The state of the SGs association is not changed.

### 5.3.3 Procedures in the MME

#### 5.3.3.1 Alert response

The MME may receive an SGsAP-ALERT-REQUEST message in any state of the
SGs association. Upon receipt of an SGsAP-ALERT-REQUEST message from the
VLR and if the IMSI is known in the MME, the MME shall reply with an
SGsAP-ALERT-ACK message and set the NEAF. If the MME has activated Idle
mode Signaling Reduction for the UE, the MME shall send an Alert MME
Notification message to the associated SGSN, as described in
3GPP TS 29.274 \[17A\], except for the conditions specified in
subclause 8.2.5c of 3GPP TS 23.272 \[7\].

#### 5.3.3.2 Alert failure

If an SGsAP-ALERT-REQUEST message is received for an IMSI that is
unknown at the MME, the MME shall return an SGsAP-ALERT-REJECT message
to the VLR indicating the SGs cause information element value \"IMSI
unknown\".

#### 5.3.3.3 Alert indication

The MME shall report to the VLR upon detection of any activity in
E-UTRAN (either signalling or, indirectly detected via S-GW, data
transfer) from the UE if the NEAF is set. If the MME detects EPS
signalling that leads to a procedure towards the VLR, the MME shall
follow this procedure and reset the NEAF. If the MME detects activity
that does not lead to any procedure towards the VLR, the MME shall send
an SGsAP-UE-ACTIVITY-INDICATION message towards the VLR and reset the
NEAF. Upon receipt of a UE Activity Notification message from the SGSN,
the MME shall reply with a UE Activity Acknowledge message, send an
SGsAP-UE-ACTIVITY-INDICATION message to the VLR and reset the NEAF flag.

For Deployment Option 2 (see subclause 8.2.4a.1 of
3GPP TS 23.272 \[7\]), if the UE is using eDRX, the MME may include the
Maximum UE Availability Time IE in the SGsAP-UE-ACTIVITY-INDICATION
message.

NOTE: This information can be used by the SMS Service Center to
prioritize the retransmission of pending Mobile Terminated Short
Messages to UEs using eDRX.

5.4 Explicit IMSI detach from EPS services
------------------------------------------

### 5.4.1 General description

This procedure is used by the MME to indicate to the VLR that the UE has
been detached from EPS services and therefore the SGs association
between the MME and the VLR has to be deactivated. This procedure only
applies to UEs which are not in the SGs-NULL state at the MME. The
procedures specified in this subclause apply to EPS detach indication
initiated by the UE or by the network as specified in
3GPP TS 24.301 \[14\].

The procedure is also used by the MME to indicate to the VLR when a
combined tracking area update procedure has been rejected by the MME,
except when the MME performs the NAS level mobility management
congestion control as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 \[14\], or the MME
receives the Detach Notification from the SGSN, as described in
3GPP TS 29.274 \[17A\], when Idle mode Signalling Reduction is
activated.

The procedure is also used by the MME to indicate to the VLR when a
periodic tracking area update procedure has been rejected by the MME,
except when the MME performs the NAS level mobility management
congestion control as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 \[14\], for a UE for
which an SGs association exists.

The Explicit IMSI detach from EPS services procedure aborts any other
ongoing procedure related to this UE on the SGs interface in the MME and
in the VLR.

### 5.4.2 Procedures in the MME

#### 5.4.2.1 Explicit EPS detach initiation

The MME shall send an SGsAP-EPS-DETACH-INDICATION message to a VLR if:

\- the MME receives a detach for EPS from the UE;

\- the MME performs network initiated EPS detach procedure;

\- the combined tracking area update procedure is rejected by the MME,
except when the MME performs the NAS level mobility management
congestion control as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 \[14\];

\- the periodic tracking area update procedure is rejected by the MME,
except when the MME performs the NAS level mobility management
congestion control as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 \[14\], for a UE for
which an SGs association exists; or

\- the MME receives a Detach Notification from the SGSN with the Detach
type indicating \"PS Detach\".

If the MME receives a Detach Request from a UE or Detach Notification
from an SGSN and the state of the SGs association to a VLR for that UE
is not SGs-NULL, the MME shall check the detach type indicated in the
Detach Request message or the detach type indicated in the Detach
Notification message. If the UE has indicated EPS detach the MME shall
send an SGsAP-EPS-DETACH-INDICATION message to the VLR indicating \"UE
initiated IMSI detach from EPS services\".

If the MME performs a network initiated detach procedure and the state
of the SGs association to a VLR for that UE is not SGs-NULL, the MME
shall send an SGsAP-EPS-DETACH-INDICATION message to the VLR indicating
\"Network initiated IMSI detach from EPS services\".

If the combined or periodic tracking area update procedure is rejected
at the MME, except when the MME performs the NAS level mobility
management congestion control as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 \[14\], for
a UE with an SGs association state different from SGs-NULL, the MME
shall send an SGsAP-EPS-DETACH-INDICATION to the VLR indicating \"EPS
services not allowed\".

After sending of the SGsAP-EPS-DETACH-INDICATION message, the MME shall
move the state of the SGs association to SGs-NULL. The MME shall start
timer Ts8 upon transmission of the SGsAP-EPS-DETACH-INDICATION message
and the MME shall stop and reset timer Ts6-1 if running.

#### 5.4.2.2 Explicit EPS detach response

If the MME receives an SGsAP-EPS-DETACH-ACK message from the VLR, the
MME shall stop timer Ts8. If a confirmation of the detach needs to be
sent to the UE, the MME shall not wait for the reception of the
SGsAP-EPS-DETACH-ACK message to send such confirmation.

#### 5.4.2.3 Abnormal cases

If no SGsAP-EPS-DETACH-ACK message is received by the MME in response to
a previous SGsAP-EPS-DETACH-INDICATION message before timer Ts8 expires,
the MME shall repeat the SGsAP-EPS-DETACH-INDICATION message a maximum
of Ns8 times.

NOTE: If no SGsAP-EPS-DETACH-ACK message is received after that, a
report is made to the O&M system. The state of the SGs association
during the acknowledgement procedure remains SGs-NULL.

### 5.4.3 Procedures in the VLR

When a VLR receives an SGsAP-EPS-DETACH-INDICATION message, the VLR
shall send an SGsAP-EPS-DETACH-ACK message to the sending MME. The VLR
shall check the MME name indicated in the SGsAP-EPS-DETACH-INDICATION
message. If the received MME name is not changed comparing to the MME
name stored in the VLR, the VLR shall move the state of the SGs
association for the UE from any state to SGs-NULL and marks the SGs
association as \"detached for EPS services\". Otherwise, the VLR shall
not change the state of the SGs association.

If the VLR's implicit detach timer is not running then the VLR shall set
and restart the implicit detach timer upon reception of an
SGsAP-EPS-DETACH-INDICATION message. If the VLR's implicit detach timer
is running (the state of the SGs association was already SGs-NULL) then
the reception of an SGsAP-EPS-DETACH-INDICATION message shall not affect
VLR's implicit detach timer.

5.5 Explicit IMSI detach from non-EPS services
----------------------------------------------

### 5.5.1 General description

This procedure is used by the MME to indicate to the VLR that the UE has
performed IMSI detach from non-EPS services and therefore the SGs
association between the MME and the VLR has to be deactivated. This
procedure applies only to UEs for which there is a SGs association at
the MME. The procedures specified in this subclause apply only to IMSI
detach request, combined IMSI and EPS detach requests from the UE or
Detach Notification message from an SGSN.

The explicit IMSI detach from non-EPS services procedure aborts any
other ongoing procedure related to this UE on the SGs interface in the
MME and in the VLR.

In order to ensure that the VLR and the UE are synchronized as to which
paging channel to use for any of the subsequent paging events, the MME
shall attempt to inform the VLR about the detach event by using a retry
scheme if the initial delivery of the SGsAP-IMSI-DETACH-INDICATION
message fails.

### 5.5.2 Procedures in the MME

#### 5.5.2.1 Explicit IMSI detach initiation

When an MME receives a Detach Request from a UE for which an SGs
association exists, the MME shall check the detach type indicated. If
the UE is indicating IMSI detach or combined EPS/IMSI detach, the MME
shall send an SGsAP-IMSI-DETACH-INDICATION message to the VLR indicating
\"Explicit UE initiated IMSI detach from non-EPS services\" or
\"Combined UE initiated IMSI detach from EPS and non-EPS services\".

When an MME receives a Detach Notification message for a UE from an SGSN
and an SGs association for the UE exists, the MME shall check the cause
and detach type indicated. If the cause is indicating \"IMSI Detach
only\", the MME shall send an SGsAP-IMSI-DETACH-INDICATION message to
the VLR indicating \"Explicit UE initiated IMSI detach from non-EPS
services\". If the cause is indicating \"Complete Detach\" and detach
type is indicating \"Combined PS/CS Detach\" as specified in
3GPP TS 29.274 \[17A\], the MME shall send an
SGsAP-IMSI-DETACH-INDICATION message to the VLR indicating \"Combined UE
initiated IMSI detach from EPS and non-EPS services\".

After the sending of the SGsAP-IMSI-DETACH-INDICATION message to the
VLR, the MME shall move the state of the SGs association to SGs-NULL.
The MME shall start timer Ts9 upon transmission of the
SGsAP-IMSI-DETACH-INDICATION message and the MME shall stop and reset
timer Ts6-1, if running.

#### 5.5.2.2 Explicit IMSI detach response

If the MME receives an SGsAP-IMSI-DETACH-ACK message from the VLR, the
MME shall stop timer Ts9. If the detach type received from the UE
indicated IMSI only detach or combined EPS/IMSI detach not due to switch
off, the MME shall wait for the reception of the SGsAP-IMSI-DETACH-ACK
message before sending the confirmation of the detach to the UE.

#### 5.5.2.3 Abnormal cases

The following abnormal cases can be identified:

i\) no SGsAP-IMSI-DETACH-ACK received for a detach with switch off

> If the MME sent an SGsAP-IMSI-DETACH-INDICATION message for a combined
> IMSI and EPS detach due to switch off and timer Ts9 expires, the MME
> shall repeat the SGsAP-IMSI-DETACH-INDICATION message a maximum of Ns9
> times.

ii\) no SGsAP-IMSI-DETACH-ACK received for a detach with no switch off

> If the MME sent an SGsAP-IMSI-DETACH-INDICATION message for an IMSI
> only detach or a combined IMSI and EPS detach not due to switch off
> and timer Ts9 expires, the MME shall repeat the
> SGsAP-IMSI-DETACH-INDICATION message a maximum of Ns9 times. If no
> SGsAP-IMSI-DETACH-ACK is received after that the MME shall send the
> confirmation of the detach to the UE.

### 5.5.3 Procedures in the VLR

When a VLR receives an SGsAP-IMSI-DETACH-INDICATION message, the VLR
shall send an SGsAP-IMSI-DETACH-ACK message to the sending MME.

The VLR shall check the MME name indicated in the
SGsAP-IMSI-DETACH-INDICATION message. If the received MME name is not
changed comparing to the MME name stored in the VLR, the VLR shall move
the state of the SGs association for the UE from any state to SGs-NULL.
If the SGsAP-IMSI-DETACH-INDICATION message indicated \"Explicit UE
initiated IMSI detach from non-EPS services\", the VLR marks the SGs
association as \"IMSI detached for non-EPS services\". If the
SGsAP-IMSI-DETACH-INDICATION message indicated \"Combined UE initiated
IMSI detach from EPS and non-EPS services\", the VLR marks the SGs
association as \"IMSI detached for EPS and non-EPS services\". The VLR
shall mark the UE as detached.

If the received MME name is different from the MME name stored in the
VLR, the VLR shall not change the state of the SGs association.

5.6 Implicit IMSI detach from non-EPS services
----------------------------------------------

### 5.6.1 General description

This procedure is used by the MME to indicate when, based on the
criteria for implicit detach as specified in 3GPP TS 23.401 \[7B\], the
MME has decided to delete the EMM context of an UE or mark its EMM
context as detached. This procedure only applies to UEs for which there
is an SGs association at the MME.

The implicit IMSI detach from non-EPS services procedure aborts any
other ongoing procedure related to this UE on the SGs interface in the
MME and in the VLR.

In order to ensure that the VLR and the UE are synchronized as to which
paging channel to use for any of the subsequent paging events the MME
shall attempt to inform the VLR about the detach event by using a retry
scheme if the initial delivery of the SGsAP-IMSI-DETACH-INDICATION
message fails.

### 5.6.2 Procedures in the MME

When the implicit IMSI detach from non-EPS services procedure is started
for a UE, the MME shall send an SGsAP-IMSI-DETACH-INDICATION message to
the VLR indicating \"Implicit network initiated IMSI detach from EPS and
non-EPS services\".

After the sending of the SGsAP-IMSI-DETACH-INDICATION message, the MME
shall move the state of the SGs association to SGs-NULL. The MME shall
start timer Ts10 upon transmission of the SGsAP-IMSI-DETACH-INDICATION
message.

If the MME receives an SGsAP-IMSI-DETACH-ACK message from the VLR, the
MME shall stop timer Ts10.

If no SGsAP-IMSI-DETACH-ACK message is received by the MME to a previous
SGsAP-IMSI-DETACH-INDICATION message before timer Ts10 expires, the MME
shall repeat the SGsAP-IMSI-DETACH-INDICATION message a maximum of Ns10
times. The state of the SGs association during the acknowledgement
procedure remains SGs-NULL.

### 5.6.3 Procedures in the VLR

When a VLR receives the SGsAP-IMSI-DETACH-INDICATION message, the VLR
shall send an SGsAP-IMSI-DETACH-ACK message to the sending MME.

The VLR shall check the MME name indicated in the
SGsAP-IMSI-DETACH-INDICATION message. If the received MME name is not
changed comparing to the MME name stored in the VLR and the state of the
SGs association is not SGs-NULL, the VLR proceeds as follows:

\- The VLR shall move the state of the SGs association for the UE to
SGs-NULL. If the VLR does not have a signalling connection for the UE,
the VLR shall mark the UE as detached. Additionally, the VLR marks the
SGs association as \"IMSI implicitly detached for EPS and non-EPS
services\".

If the received MME name is different from the MME name stored in the
VLR, the VLR shall not change the state of the SGs association.

5.7 VLR failure procedure
-------------------------

### 5.7.1 General description

This procedure is used by the VLR to inform the MMEs with an SGs
association about the recovery from an internal failure that has
affected the SGs association with the MMEs when the VLR fails with
restart.

NOTE: The VLR recovery procedure is handled in such a way that the
signalling load on the VLR and MMEs does not create any overload
problem.

### 5.7.2 Procedures in the VLR

#### 5.7.2.1 VLR Reset Initiation

In the event of a failure at the VLR which has resulted in the loss of
the SGs association information for some UEs, the VLR shall move from
any state to the SGs-NULL state for these UEs. The VLR shall also set
the \"Confirmed by Radio Contact\" restoration indicator to \"false\"
(see 3GPP TS 23.007 \[4\]) for affected UEs. The VLR shall not send any
SGsAP-MM-INFORMATION-REQUEST messages to UEs with the SGs association in
the SGs-NULL state.

When the VLR restarts, the VLR shall send an SGsAP-RESET-INDICATION
message to all the MMEs connected to the VLR by the SGs interface. This
message indicates to the MME that for the UEs with an SGs association to
that VLR, the SGs association is no longer reliable. The VLR shall also
start a separate timer Ts11 for each MME.

#### 5.7.2.2 VLR Reset Response

Upon receipt of an SGsAP-RESET-ACK message from an MME, the VLR shall
stop the timer Ts11 for that MME.

#### 5.7.2.3 Abnormal cases

If the VLR does not receive an SGsAP-RESET-ACK message from that MME
before the timer Ts11 expires, the VLR shall retransmit the
SGsAP-RESET-INDICATION message. The retransmission is repeated a maximum
of Ns11 times.

NOTE: If no SGsAP-RESET-ACK is received after that a report is made to
the O&M system.

### 5.7.3 Procedures in the MME

#### 5.7.3.1 VLR reset indication

Upon receipt of an SGsAP-RESET-INDICATION message from the VLR, the MME
is informed that all the SGs associations with that VLR for all the UEs
registered in the MME are no longer reliable because the VLR has lost
information about the state of the UEs and during the failure the VLR
might have missed signalling messages. The MME shall set the
\"VLR-Reliable\" MM context variable to \"false\". The detach procedures
for deleting the SGs association are still applicable (see
subclauses 5.4, 5.5 and 5.6).

The MME sends an SGsAP-RESET-ACK message to the VLR.

If the \"VLR-Reliable\" MM context variable is set to \"false\", upon
reception of a combined tracking area update request or a periodic
tracking area update request from the UE that is attached for non-EPS
service, the MME may:

\- if a combined tracking area update request is received, immediately
perform the location update for non-EPS services procedure towards the
VLR as described in subclause 5.2; or

\- if a periodic tracking area update request is received, dependent on
network configuration and operator policy,

\- perform a network initiated detach with detach type \"IMSI detach\"
immediately after the completion of the periodic tracking area update
procedure; or

\- perform immediately the location update for non-EPS services
procedure towards the VLR as described in subclause 5.2.

#### 5.7.3.2 Void

5.8 MME failure procedure
-------------------------

### 5.8.1 General description

This procedure is used by the MME to inform the associated VLRs about
the recovery from an internal failure that has affected the SGs
association with the VLRs.

NOTE: The MME recovery procedure is handled in such a way that the
signalling load on the MME and VLRs does not create any overload
problem.

### 5.8.2 Procedures in the MME

#### 5.8.2.1 MME Reset Initiation

In the event of a failure at the MME which has resulted in the loss of
the SGs association information on some UEs, the MME shall move from any
state to the SGs-NULL state for these affected UEs. The MME shall also
set the \"MME-Reset\" MM context variable to \"true\" and start the
timer Ts12-1. When the timer Ts12-1 expires the \"MME-Reset\" MM context
variable is set to \"false\".

The MME may send an SGsAP-RESET-INDICATION message to all the VLRs
connected to the MME by SGs interfaces. The SGsAP-RESET-INDICATION
message indicates to the VLR that all the SGs associations with that
particular MME for all the UEs registered in the VLR are no longer
reliable. The normal procedures for updating the SGs association are
still applicable (see subclauses 5.2, 5.4, 5.5 and 5.6). The MME shall
also start a separate timer Ts12-2 for each VLR.

If the MME does not send an SGsAP-RESET-INDICATION message, the MME
shall move from any state to the SGs-NULL state only for the
associations of the UEs affected by the loss of VLR association
information.

NOTE: The option to not send any SGsAP-RESET-INDICATION message to all
the VLRs connected to the MME by SGs interfaces reduces subsequent
paging signalling initiated by VLRs by avoiding a complete search of the
UE on the entire VLR area.

#### 5.8.2.2 MME Reset Response

Upon receipt of an SGsAP-RESET-ACK message, the MME shall stop the
timer Ts12-2 for that VLR.

#### 5.8.2.3 Abnormal cases

If the MME does not receive an SGsAP-RESET-ACK message from that VLR
before the timer Ts12-2 expires, the MME shall retransmit the
SGsAP-RESET-INDICATION message. The retransmission is repeated a maximum
of Ns12 times.

NOTE: If no SGsAP-RESET-ACK is received after that a report is made to
the O&M system.

### 5.8.3 Procedures in the VLR

Upon receipt of an SGsAP-RESET-INDICATION message from the MME, the VLR
is informed that all the SGs associations with that MME for all the UEs
registered in the MME are no longer reliable because the MME has lost
information about the state of the UEs for that VLR and during the
failure the MME might have missed signalling messages. The VLR shall
either:

\- set the \"Confirmed by Radio Contact\" restoration indicator to
\"false\" in all the SGs associations containing the restarted MME and
set the state of all the SGs associations containing the restarted MME
to the SGs-NULL state; or

\- keep the \'Confirmed by Radio Contact\' restoration indication and
the state of all the SGs associations containing the restarted MME
unchanged.

NOTE: The option to not set the \'Confirmed by Radio Contact\'
restoration indicator to \'false\' in all the associations containing
the restarted MME reduces subsequent paging signalling the VLR can
initiate by avoiding a complete search of the UE on the entire VLR area.

The VLR shall then send an SGsAP-RESET-ACK message to the MME.

If the \"Confirmed by Radio Contact\" restoration indicator is \"false\"
the VLR may send paging messages on both the SGs and the A/Iu interface.

5.9 HSS failure
---------------

### 5.9.1 General description

This subclause describes the MME behaviour towards the VLR as a
consequence of an HSS reset.

In the case of an HSS failure, the HSS informs the associated MMEs about
the recovery from an internal failure that has affected the SGs
association with the MMEs according to the HSS reset procedure specified
in 3GPP TS **29.272** **\[17\]**.

This information is used in the MME to trigger the VLR to perform a
location update towards the HSS in order to restore the HSS subscriber
data.

### 5.9.2 Procedures in the MME

Upon receipt of a HSS reset indication from the HSS, the MME shall set
the NEAF for all registered UEs in the MME for which a valid SGs
association with a VLR exists.

Upon detection of any signalling activity from the UE, the MME shall
report to the VLR if the NEAF, as defined in subclause 5.3.3, is set for
this UE. If the MME detects signalling that leads to a procedure towards
the VLR, the MME shall follow this procedure and reset the NEAF. If the
MME detects activity that does not lead to any procedure towards the
VLR, the MME shall send an SGsAP-UE-ACTIVITY-INDICATION message towards
the VLR and reset the NEAF. The MME may delay sending the activity
indication for a maximum operator-configuration depending time period to
avoid high signalling load.

5.10 MM information procedure
-----------------------------

### 5.10.1 General description

The MM information procedure is performed between the VLR and the MME
via the SGs interface if the target UE for the MM information procedure
is IMSI attached to both EPS and non-EPS services (i.e. the state of the
SGs association is SGs-ASSOCIATED). The outcome of the MM Information
procedure does not change the state of the SGs association at the VLR or
MME.

### 5.10.2 Procedures in the VLR

If for the target UE for the MM information procedure the state of the
SGs association in the VLR is SGs-ASSOCIATED, the VLR may initiate the
MM information procedure by transferring an SGsAP-MM-INFORMATION-REQUEST
message to the MME.

### 5.10.3 Procedures in the MME

If an SGsAP-MM-INFORMATION-REQUEST message is received for a UE for
which there exists an SGs association at the MME, dependent on operator
preference the MME shall either:

1\) check and update the contents of the received MM information
information element. The MME then sends the resultant contents of the MM
information information element to the UE indicated in the
SGsAP-MM-INFORMATION-REQUEST message, using an EMM INFORMATION message
as defined in 3GPP TS 24.301 \[14\]; or

2\) discard the SGsAP-MM-INFORMATION-REQUEST message. In this case the
MME can send an EMM INFORMATION message as defined in
3GPP TS 24.301 \[14\] to the UE, with contents generated locally by the
MME.

The MME should avoid sending both EMM INFORMATION messages according to
option 1 and EMM INFORMATION messages according to option 2 to the same
UE.

NOTE 1: Sending messages according to option 1 and option 2 to the same
UE can result in short-time changes of the network name or the local
time displayed by the UE.

For option 1) the MME checks and updates the contents of the MM
information information element as follows:

a\) If LSA Identity has been included in the MM information, the MME
shall discard the LSA Identity;

b\) If the network spans more than one time zone, the MME shall handle
the time-related parameters as follows:

\- if Network Daylight Saving Time has been included in the MM
information, then the MME shall discard the Network Daylight Saving
Time;

\- if Local Time Zone has been included in the MM information, then the
MME shall replace the Local Time Zone with the Local Time Zone
applicable for this UE. In addition, if the local time zone in the MME
has been adjusted for daylight saving time, the MME shall indicate this
by including the value used for adjustment in Network Daylight Saving
Time IE in the MM information;

\- if Universal time and local time zone has been included in the MM
information, then the MME shall replace it with the Universal time and
local time zone applicable for this UE. In addition, if the local time
zone in the MME has been adjusted for daylight saving time, the MME
shall indicate this by including the value used for adjustment in
Network Daylight Saving Time IE in the MM information;

NOTE 2: For the determination of the number of time zones, both CS and
PS domain are taken into account.

c\) If the network name, i.e. Full name for network or Short name for
network or both, has been included by the VLR in the MM information
information element, then dependent on operator preference and other
information, e.g. the IMSI of the subscriber, the MME may

\- replace the network name received from the VLR with a different
network name;

\- remove the network name from the MM information information element;
or

\- keep the network name received from the VLR unchanged.

NOTE 3: The network name received from the VLR can be different from the
network name provided by the MME, e.g. if multiple PLMNs are available
for the CS domain.

5.11 Procedure for tunnelling of NAS messages
---------------------------------------------

### 5.11.1 General description

The tunnelling of NAS messages procedure is used to encapsulate the NAS
messages exchanged between the UE and the VLR. This procedure can be
used by either the VLR or the MME depending on the direction of the NAS
message. The two procedures are identified as uplink unitdata, in the
direction from the MME to the VLR, and downlink unitdata in the
direction from the VLR to the MME.

### 5.11.2 Uplink unitdata procedure

#### 5.11.2.1 Procedures in the MME

When the MME receives an Uplink NAS Transport message (see
3GPP TS 24.301 \[14\]) from a UE, the MME shall copy the value part of
the NAS message container information element to the value part of the
NAS message container information element of the SGsAP-UPLINK-UNITDATA
message and send the SGsAP-UPLINK-UNITDATA message to the VLR if the
\"VLR-Reliable\" MM context variable is not set to \"false\". If the
\"VLR-Reliable\" MM context variable is set to \"false\", the MME
requests the UE to re-attach for non-EPS services as specified in
3GPP TS 24.301 \[14\].

In order to permit the VLR to create an accurate charging record, the
MME shall add the IMEISV, the UE Time Zone, the Mobile Station Classmark
2, and the UE's current TAI and E-CGI to the SGsAP-UPLINK-UNITDATA
message.

#### 5.11.2.2 Procedures in the VLR

##### 5.11.2.2.1 General description

Upon reception of an SGsAP-UPLINK-UNITDATA, the VLR shall extract the
NAS message container information element and treat the value part of
this information element according to the procedures defined in
3GPP TS 24.011 \[10\].

Other parameters in the message may be used as specified in
3GPP TS 32.250 \[17B\] and 3GPP TS 23.078 \[5AA\].

##### 5.11.2.2.2 Abnormal cases

The following abnormal cases can be identified:

i\) subscriber data does not exist or is not confirmed by HLR

If the VLR receives an SGsAP-UPLINK-UNITDATA message from the MME for a
UE for which subscriber data does not exist or is not confirmed by HLR,
then the VLR shall ignore the received message, and return an
SGsAP-RELEASE-REQUEST message to the MME with an SGs cause information
element indicating \"IMSI unknown\".

ii\) subscriber data exists, but there is no SGs association for the UE
at the VLR

If the VLR receives an SGsAP-UPLINK-UNITDATA message from the MME for a
UE for which no SGs association exists, then the VLR shall ignore the
received message, and return an SGsAP-RELEASE-REQUEST message to the MME
with an SGs cause information element indicating \"IMSI detached for
non-EPS services\".

#### 5.11.2.3 Void

### 5.11.3 Downlink unitdata procedure

#### 5.11.3.1 Procedures in the VLR

When the VLR needs to send a NAS message to the UE, the VLR shall first
verify whether or not it has an SGs association for the UE. If the state
of the SGs association for the UE is SGs-ASSOCIATED and
LA-UPDATE-PRESENT, then the VLR continues with the procedure. The VLR
shall build and encapsulate the NAS message into the value part of the
NAS message container information element of an SGsAP-DOWNLINK-UNITDATA
message and send the SGsAP-DOWNLINK-UNITDATA message to the MME.

#### 5.11.3.2 Procedures in the MME

##### 5.11.3.2.1 General description

Upon reception of an SGsAP-DOWNLINK-UNITDATA message, the MME shall
proceed as follows:

\- If the UE was in EMM-CONNECTED mode, the MME shall copy the value
part of the NAS message container information element to the value part
of the NAS message container information element of a Downlink NAS
Transport message (see 3GPP TS 24.301 \[14\]) and shall send the
Downlink NAS Transport message to the UE; or

\- In Deployment Option 3 (see subclause 8.2.4a.1 of
3GPP TS 23.272 \[7\]), if the UE was in EMM-IDLE mode and temporarily
unreachable for paging due to using eDRX (as specified in
3GPP TS 24.301 \[14\]), the MME behaves as specified in
subclause 8.2.4a.3 of 3GPP TS 23.272 \[7\].

##### 5.11.3.2.2 Abnormal cases

The following abnormal cases can be identified:

i\) subscriber data does not exist or is not confirmed by HSS

If the MME receives an SGsAP-DOWNLINK-UNITDATA message from the VLR for
a UE for which subscriber data does not exist or is not confirmed by
HSS, then the MME shall ignore the received message.

ii\) subscriber data exists, but there is no SGs association for the UE
at the MME

If the MME receives an SGsAP-DOWNLINK-UNITDATA message from the VLR for
a UE for which there is no SGs association, then the MME shall ignore
the received message.

#### 5.11.3.3 Void

### 5.11.4 Release procedure

When the VLR determines that there are no more NAS messages to be
exchanged between the VLR and the UE, or when a further exchange of NAS
messages for the specified UE is not possible due to an error, the VLR
shall send the SGsAP-RELEASE-REQUEST message to the MME, including the
IMSI of the UE for which there are no more NAS messages to be tunnelled.

NOTE: For the SMS transport, the VLR can send the SGsAP-RELEASE-REQUEST
message when the SMS transaction is complete (reception of a CP-ACK
message for the MO case, sending of a CP-ACK message for the MT case),
upon reception of a CP-ERROR message, abort of SMS transaction by upper
layers, or upon some error cases such as TC1 expiry, no SGs association
for the UE or IMSI unknown.

Upon receipt of an SGsAP-RELEASE-REQUEST message with an SGs cause
information element indicating \"IMSI unknown\" or \"IMSI detached for
non-EPS services\", the MME shall set the \"VLR-Reliable\" MM context
variable to \"false\". In addition, the MME requests the UE to re-attach
for non-EPS services as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 \[14\].

5.12 Service request procedure
------------------------------

### 5.12.1 General description

After the reception of an SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message from the VLR, the
MME will use this procedure to indicate to the VLR that a NAS signalling
connection exists between the UE and the MME.

The procedure can be invoked, by the MME as follows:

\- Upon reception of a Service Request message or Extended Service
Request message from the UE;

\- Directly after receiving the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message from the
VLR, based on the UE's EMM mode; or

\- In Deployment Option 3 (see subclause 8.2.4a.1 of
3GPP TS 23.272 \[7\]), detecting the UE is temporarily unreachable for
paging due to using eDRX (as specified in 3GPP TS 24.301 \[14\]) and the
Service indicator information element in the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST
message indicates \"SMS indicator\".

### 5.12.2 Procedures in the MME

When receiving the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message, the MME shall first
take action as described in subclause 5.1.3 and check whether the UE,
for which the paging is sent, is in EMM-IDLE or EMM-CONNECTED mode.

If the MME accepts the paging request, the MME shall proceed as follows:

\- If the UE was in EMM-CONNECTED mode, the MME creates and sends an
SGsAP-SERVICE-REQUEST message to the VLR based on the conditions
specified in 3GPP TS 23.272 \[7\]. If the UE subsequently rejects the CS
fallback call, the MME shall send the SGsAP-PAGING-REJECT message to the
VLR with the SGs cause information element indicating \"Mobile
terminating CS fallback call rejected by the user\";

\- If the UE was in EMM-IDLE mode and the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message
was received with LAI, the MME shall send the SGsAP-SERVICE-REQUEST
message to the VLR when the UE enters EMM-CONNECTED mode;

\- If the UE was in EMM-IDLE mode and the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message
was received without LAI, the MME behaves as specified in
subclause 4.8.1 of 3GPP TS 23.272 \[7\]; or

\- In Deployment Option 3 (see subclause 8.2.4a.1 of
3GPP TS 23.272 \[7\]), if the UE was in EMM-IDLE mode and temporarily
unreachable for paging due to using eDRX (as specified in
3GPP TS 24.301 \[14\]), and the Service indicator information element in
the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message indicates \"SMS indicator\", the MME
behaves as specified in subclause 8.2.4a.3 of 3GPP TS 23.272 \[7\].

The MME shall set the service indicator in the SGsAP-SERVICE-REQUEST
message equal to what was received in the SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message.
Additionally, in order to permit the VLR to create an accurate charging
record, the MME shall add the IMEISV, the UE Time Zone, the Mobile
Station Classmark 2, and the UE\'s current TAI and E-CGI to the
SGsAP-SERVICE-REQUEST message.

### 5.12.3 Procedures in the VLR

Upon reception of the SGsAP-SERVICE-REQUEST message, the VLR shall stop
Timer Ts5 and consider the paging procedure as successful. If the paging
procedure is for SMS, the VLR shall then start the delivery of the SMS
message(s) according to the subclause 5.11.3.1. If the paging procedure
with the Service indicator information element indicating \"SMS
Indicator\" was triggered upon reception of a Provide Subscriber
Information Request message, the VLR can return an SGs
AP-RELEASE-REQUEST message to the MME as specified in subclause 7.2.3.5
of 3GPP TS 23.018 \[5\].

Other parameters in the message may be used as specified in
3GPP TS 32.250 \[17B\] and 3GPP TS 23.078 \[5AA\].

5.13 Service abort procedure
----------------------------

### 5.13.1 General description

This procedure can be invoked by the VLR to abort a mobile terminating
CS fallback call during call establishment. The procedure applies to UEs
that are simultaneously attached for EPS services and non-EPS services,
but not to UEs attached for EPS services and SMS only.

### 5.13.2 Procedures in the VLR

If the VLR decides to abort a mobile terminating CS fallback call for
which it has sent an SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message to the MME, and the
VLR has not received an SCCP connection establishment containing the
Initial L3 message from the UE via the A or Iu interface, the VLR shall
send the SGsAP-SERVICE-ABORT-REQUEST message to the MME. The state of
the SGs association is not changed.

### 5.13.3 Procedures in the MME

When the MME receives the SGsAP-SERVICE-ABORT-REQUEST message from the
VLR, the MME shall set the Call Cancelled Flag to \"true\".

If the MME receives an EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message from the UE with
Service type set to \"mobile terminating CS fallback or 1xCS fallback\"
and CSFB response set to \"CS fallback accepted by the UE\" and the Call
Cancelled Flag is set to \"true\", the MME shall set the Call Cancelled
Flag to \"false\" and will reject the CS fallback call as specified in
3GPP TS 24.301 \[14\].

If the Call Cancelled Flag is set to \"true\", the MME shall set the
Call Cancelled Flag to \"false\":

\- upon reception of the EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST message from the UE
with Service type set to a value other than \"mobile terminating CS
fallback or 1xCS fallback\" or CSFB response set to a value other than
\"CS fallback accepted by the UE\"; or

\- upon reception of a new SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST message from the VLR.

When the MME receives the SGsAP-SERVICE-ABORT-REQUEST message after the
UE has accepted the CS fallback call, the MME shall discard the
SGsAP-SERVICE-ABORT-REQUEST message. The state of the SGs association is
not changed.

5.14 Implicit IMSI detach from EPS services
-------------------------------------------

### 5.14.1 General description

This procedure is used by the MME to indicate when, based on the
criteria for implicit detach as specified in 3GPP TS 23.401 \[7B\], the
MME has decided to delete the EMM context of an UE or mark its EMM
context as detached. This procedure only applies to UEs for which there
is an SGs association at the MME and the network operating in NMO I and
supporting ISR.

The implicit IMSI detach from EPS services procedure aborts any other
ongoing procedure related to this UE on the SGs interface in the MME and
in the VLR.

In order to ensure that the VLR and the UE are synchronized as to which
paging channel to use for any of the subsequent paging events the MME
shall attempt to inform the VLR about the detach event by using a retry
scheme if the initial delivery of the SGsAP-EPS-DETACH-INDICATION
message fails.

### 5.14.2 Procedures in the MME

When the implicit IMSI detach from EPS services procedure is started for
a UE, the MME shall send an SGsAP-EPS-DETACH-INDICATION message to the
VLR indicating \"Network initiated IMSI detach from EPS services\".

After the sending of the SGsAP-EPS-DETACH-INDICATION message, the MME
shall move the state of the SGs association to SGs-NULL. The MME shall
start timer Ts13 upon transmission of the SGsAP-EPS-DETACH-INDICATION
message.

If the MME receives an SGsAP-EPS-DETACH-ACK message from the VLR, the
MME shall stop timer Ts13.

If no SGsAP-EPS-DETACH-ACK message is received by the MME to a previous
SGsAP-EPS-DETACH-INDICATION message before timer Ts13 expires, the MME
shall repeat the SGsAP-EPS-DETACH-INDICATION message a maximum of Ns10
times. The state of the SGs association during the acknowledgement
procedure remains SGs-NULL.

### 5.14.3 Procedures in the VLR

When a VLR receives an SGsAP-EPS-DETACH-INDICATION message, the VLR
shall perform the procedures described in subclause 5.4.3.

5.15 UE fallback supervision procedure
--------------------------------------

### 5.15.0 General description

This procedure is used by the VLR to monitor the status of the UE
fallback procedure, after the VLR has sent an SGsAP-PAGING-REQUEST
message to the MME.

### 5.15.1 Procedures in the VLR

Upon receipt of an SGsAP-SERVICE-REQUEST message from the MME, if the
Service indicator information element in the SGsAP-SERVICE-REQUEST
message indicates \"CS call indicator\", the VLR shall start timer Ts14
to supervise the success of UE fallback.

The VLR shall stop timer Ts14 in the following cases:

\- upon receipt of an SCCP connection establishment containing the
Initial L3 message from the UE via the A or Iu interface;

\- upon receipt of an SGsAP-PAGING-REJECT message; or

\- upon expiry of the CFNRy timer and if Call Forwarding on No Reply
(CFNRy) has been configured and activated for the terminating UE.

NOTE 1: Upon expiry of the CFNRy timer, the VLR triggers Call Forwarding
on No Reply (CFNRy) as specified in 3GPP TS 23.082 \[5B\] and
3GPP TS 29.011 \[15A\].

If Call Forwarding on No Reply (CFNRy) is not activated for the
terminating UE, upon expiry of timer Ts14, the VLR shall release the
call as specified in 3GPP TS 24.008\[8\].

NOTE 2: Before releasing the call, the VLR needs to consider whether
A/Iu paging is ongoing. In addition, if the VLR considers the paging
procedure completed, and no response has been received from the UE via
the A or Iu interface, and if CFNRc has been configured and activated
for the terminating UE, the VLR applies the equivalent handling as for
Call Forwarding on Not Reachable, as specified in 3GPP TS 23.082 \[5B\]
and 3GPP TS 29.011 \[15A\].

5.16 Procedure for MO CSFB indication
-------------------------------------

### 5.16.1 General description

If the network is configured to support the return to the last used
E-UTRAN PLMN after CS fallback as specified in 3GPP TS 23.272 \[7\],
this procedure is used to indicate to the VLR that the UE initiated a
service request for MO CS fallback.

### 5.16.2 Procedures in the MME

If the MME is configured to support the return to the last used E-UTRAN
PLMN after CS fallback, upon reception of an EXTENDED SERVICE REQUEST
message (see 3GPP TS 24.301 \[14\]) from the UE with Service type set to
\"mobile originating CS fallback or 1xCS fallback\" or \"mobile
originating CS fallback emergency call or 1xCS fallback emergency call\"
from the UE, the MME shall send the SGsAP-MO-CSFB-INDICATION message to
the VLR.

### 5.16.3 Procedures in the VLR

If the VLR is configured to support the return to the last used E-UTRAN
PLMN after CS fallback, upon reception of an SGsAP-MO-CSFB-INDICATION,
the VLR shall start timer Ts15 to supervise the success of the UE
fallback.

If an SCCP connection establishment containing the Initial L3 message is
received from the UE via the A or Iu interface, the VLR shall stop timer
Ts15 and apply specific handling related to the return to the last used
E-UTRAN PLMN after CS fallback.

Upon expiry of Ts15, the VLR considers the MO CSFB to have failed and
does not apply specific handling related to support of the return to the
last used E-UTRAN PLMN after CS fallback.

6 SGs transport
===============

6.1 General
-----------

This subclause specifies the standards for signalling transport to be
used across SGs interface. SGs interface is a logical interface between
the MME and the VLR. All the SGsAP messages described in the present
document require an SCTP association between the MME and the VLR.

6.2 IP layer
------------

The MME and the VLR shall support IPv6 (see IETF RFC 2460 \[22\]) and/or
IPv4 (see IETF RFC 791 \[20\]).

The IP layer of SGs only supports point-to-point transmission for
delivering SGsAP messages.

6.3 Transport layer
-------------------

SCTP (see IETF RFC 4960 \[23\]) shall be supported as the transport
layer of SGsAP messages.

Semi-permanent SCTP associations shall be established between the MME
and VLR, i.e. the SCTP associations shall remain up under normal
circumstances. The MME shall establish the SCTP association.

Transport network redundancy can be achieved by SCTP multi-homing
between two end-points, of which one or both is assigned with multiple
IP addresses. SCTP end-points shall support a multi-homed remote SCTP
end-point.

NOTE 1: If the association initialization to an IP destination address
of the VLR is unsuccessful and alternative destination IP address(es)
are known, the MME reattempts initialization to an alternative IP
address.

For SCTP endpoint redundancy, an SCTP endpoint (in the MME or VLR) may
send an INIT, at any time for an already established SCTP association,
which the other SCTP endpoint shall handle as defined in
IETF RFC 4960 \[23\].

MME and VLR shall support a configuration with a single SCTP association
per MME/VLR pair. Configurations with multiple SCTP endpoints per
MME/VLR pair may be supported.

NOTE 2: If multiple SCTP endpoints are configured and several SCTP
associations are established between the MME/VLR pair, whether the VLR
and the MME send and receive SGsAP messages via same or different SCTP
associations for a given UE is up to implementation.

Within the SCTP association established between one MME and one VLR,
both MME and VLR shall reserve several stream identifiers, based on the
INIT message exchange for the sole use of SGsAP procedures.

The registered port number for SGsAP is 29118.

The payload protocol identifier to be used for SGsAP is 0.

7 Error handling
================

7.1 General
-----------

This subclause specifies procedures for the handling of unknown,
unforeseen, and erroneous protocol data by the receiving entity (i.e.
the MME or the VLR). These procedures are called \"error handling
procedures\", but in addition to providing recovery mechanisms for error
situations, they define a compatibility mechanism for future extensions
of the protocol.

In this subclause, the following terminology is used:

\- an information element is defined to be syntactically incorrect in a
message if it contains at least one value defined as \"reserved\", or if
its value part violates coding rules. However, it is not a syntactical
error that an information element indicates in its Length Indicator a
greater length than defined in the relevant subclause; and

\- a message is defined to have semantically incorrect contents if it
contains information which, possibly dependant on the state of the
receiver, is in contradiction to the resources of the receiver and/or to
the procedural part of current specification.

When a receiving entity detects the need to send an SGsAP-STATUS message
(see errors detailed below), the entity shall copy the IMSI information
element value (if included) of the incorrect message to the IMSI
information element of the SGsAP-STATUS message. The message in error is
also included in the SGsAP-STATUS message. Both the receiving and the
sending entity shall abandon the procedure related to the incorrect
message and return to the state from where the procedure related to the
incorrect message was started.

An SGsAP-STATUS message shall not be sent in response to a received
SGsAP-STATUS message.

Both the receiving and the sending entity shall inform the O&M entity
upon sending or receiving an SGsAP-STATUS message.

The next subclauses shall be applied in order of precedence.

7.2 Message too short
---------------------

When the receiving entity receives a message that is too short to
contain a complete message type information element, the receiving
entity shall ignore that message.

7.3 Unknown or unforeseen message type
--------------------------------------

The entity receiving a message with a message type not defined or not
implemented shall ignore the message. The receiving entity shall return
an SGsAP-STATUS message with the SGs cause information element set to
\"message unknown\" and the Erroneous message information element
containing the received message.

The entity receiving a message that is not compatible with the protocol
state shall return an SGsAP-STATUS message with the SGs cause
information element set to \"message not compatible with the protocol
state\" and the erroneous message.

The entity receiving a message that is not defined to be received by
that entity (i.e. the message is sent in the wrong direction) shall
treat the message as unknown message and shall ignore the message. The
entity shall return an SGsAP-STATUS message with the SGs cause
information element set to \"message unknown\" and the Erroneous message
information element containing the received message.

7.4 Missing mandatory information element
-----------------------------------------

When the receiving entity diagnoses a \"missing mandatory information
element\" error, the receiving entity shall ignore the message and
return an SGsAP-STATUS message with the SGs cause information element
set to \"missing mandatory information element\" and shall return the
Erroneous message information element containing the received message.

7.5 Information elements unknown or unforeseen in the message
-------------------------------------------------------------

The receiving entity shall ignore all information elements unknown or
unforeseen in a message.

7.6 Out of sequence information elements
----------------------------------------

The receiving entity shall ignore all information elements that are out
of sequence.

7.7 Repeated information elements
---------------------------------

If an information element with format T, TV, or TLV is repeated in a
message in which repetition of the information element is not specified,
the receiving entity shall only handle the contents of the information
element appearing first and shall ignore all subsequent repetitions of
the information element. When repetition of information elements is
specified, the receiving entity shall only handle the contents of
specified repeated information elements. If the limit on repetition of
information elements is exceeded, the receiving entity shall handle the
contents of information elements appearing first up to the limit of
repetitions and shall ignore all subsequent repetitions of the
information element.

7.8 Syntactically incorrect mandatory information element.
----------------------------------------------------------

On receipt of a message which contains a syntactically incorrect
mandatory information element, the receiver shall ignore the message and
return an SGsAP-STATUS message with the SGs cause information element
set to \"invalid mandatory information\" and shall return the Erroneous
message information element containing the received message.

7.9 Syntactically incorrect optional information elements
---------------------------------------------------------

The receiving entity shall treat all optional information elements that
are syntactically incorrect in a message as not present in the message.

7.10 Conditional information element errors
-------------------------------------------

When the entity receiving a message diagnoses a \"missing conditional
information element\" error or an \"unexpected conditional information
element\" error or when it receives a message containing at least one
syntactically incorrect conditional information element which is
required to be present in the message, the receiving entity shall ignore
the message and return an SGsAP-STATUS message with the SGs cause
information element set to \"conditional information element error\" and
shall return the Erroneous message information element containing the
received message.

When the entity receives a message containing a syntactically incorrect
conditional information element which is not required to be present in
the message, nor required to be absent in the message, then the
receiving entity shall ignore that information element.

7.11 Information elements with semantically incorrect contents
--------------------------------------------------------------

When an information element with semantically incorrect contents is
received, the foreseen reactions of the procedural part of the present
specification are performed.

If however no such reactions are specified, the receiving entity shall
ignore that information element and treat the rest of the message. If,
because this information element was ignored, the rest of the message
can no longer be handled then the receiving entity shall return an
SGsAP-STATUS message with the SGs cause information element set to
\"semantically incorrect message\" and shall return the Erroneous
message information element containing the received message.

### 8.9.2 New TMSI, or IMSI

This information element represents the identity to be used for (and
then by) the UE.

If this information element is an IMSI, then the UE is not allocated any
TMSI (and deletes any TMSI accordingly). If this information element is
a TMSI, then the UE will use this TMSI as the new temporary identity
(the UE deletes its old TMSI if available, and stores the new TMSI). If
neither a TMSI nor an IMSI are included in this information element, the
old TMSI, if any available, will be kept.

9 Information element coding
============================

9.1 Overview
------------

This clause specifies the coding of the information elements used in by
the SGsAP protocol.

The spare bits in the coding of an information element shall be set to
zero by the sender and shall be ignored by the receiver.

All unassigned codes (whether omitted or explicitely *Unassigned* in the
text) shall be treated as unknown (see clause 7).

9.2 Message type
----------------

Message type uniquely identifies the message being sent. It is a single
octet information element, mandatory in all messages. Table 9.2.1
defines the value part of the Message type information element.

### 9.4.18 SGs cause

The purpose of the SGs cause information element is to indicate an error
to the receiving entity. This could be a protocol data error, to
indicate to the VLR the reason why a paging procedure could not be
performed or to indicate to the VLR that the mobile terminating CS
fallback call has been rejected by the user. The SGs cause information
element is coded as shown in figure 9.4.18.1 and table 9.4.18.1.
