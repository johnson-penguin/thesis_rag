 1 Scope
=======

The present document describes the applicability of NG Application
Protocol (NGAP) messages and procedures, defined in 3GPP TS 38.413
\[2\], to non-3GPP access. A general description for non-3GPP access can
be found in 3GPP TS 23.501 \[3\], 3GPP TS 23.502 \[4\], and 3GPP TS
23.316 \[6\].

3 Abbreviations
===============

For the purposes of the present document, the abbreviations given in
3GPP TR 21.905 \[1\] and the following apply. An abbreviation defined in
the present document takes precedence over the definition of the same
abbreviation, if any, in 3GPP TR 21.905 \[1\].

5G-RG 5G Residential Gateway

FN-RG Fixed Network Residential Gateway

N3IWF Non-3GPP InterWorking Function

TNAP Trusted Non-3GPP Access Point

TNGF Trusted Non-3GPP Gateway Function

TWIF Trusted WLAN Interworking Function

W-AGF Wireline Access Gateway Function

4 Principles for the use of NGAP for non-3GPP access
====================================================

4.1 General
-----------

TS 23.501 \[3\] specifies the NGAP used between the Non-3GPP access
network node and the AMF. The Non-3GPP access network node is either a
Non-3GPP InterWorking Function (N3IWF), or a Trusted Non-3GPP Gateway
Function (TNGF), or a Trusted WLAN Interworking Function (TWIF), or a
Wireline Access Gateway Function (W-AGF). NGAP is used as specified in
TS 38.413 \[2\] with clarifications or additions as specified in Clause
5.

5 Non-3GPP access
=================

5.1 Use of the NGAP for non-3GPP access
---------------------------------------

The following NGAP procedures are used between the Non-3GPP access
network node and the AMF:

\- PDU Session Management Procedures

\- PDU Session Resource Setup

\- PDU Session Resource Release

\- PDU Session Resource Modify

\- PDU Session Resource Notify

\- UE Context Management Procedures

\- Initial Context Setup

\- UE Context Release Request

\- UE Context Release

\- UE Context Modification

\- Transport of NAS Messages Procedures

\- Initial UE Message

\- Downlink NAS Transport

\- Uplink NAS Transport

\- NAS Non Delivery Indication

\- Reroute NAS Request

\- Interface Management Procedures

\- NG Setup

\- RAN Configuration Update

\- AMF Configuration Update

\- NG Reset

\- Error Indication

\- AMF Status Indication

\- Overload Start

\- Overload Stop

\- UE TNLA Binding Procedures

\- UE TNLA Binding Release

For the NGAP procedures used between the Non-3GPP access network node
and the AMF, the Non-3GPP access network node fulfils the behaviour of
the NG-RAN node as specified in clause 8 of TS 38.413 \[2\], with
clarifications as specified in Clause 5.3. The text in clause 8 of TS
38.413 \[2\] referring to Uu should be understood as referring to the Y2
reference point as specified in TS 23.501 \[3\].
