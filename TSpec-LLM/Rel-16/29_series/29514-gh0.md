4 Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization Service
===================================

4.1 Service Description
-----------------------

### 4.1.1 Overview

The Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization Service, as defined in
3GPP TS 23.502 \[3\] and in 3GPP TS 23.503 \[4\], is provided by the
Policy Control Function (PCF).

The Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization service authorises an AF request and
creates policies as requested by the authorised NF service consumer for
the PDU session to which the AF session is bound to. This service also
allows the NF service consumer to subscribe/unsubscribe to notifications
on events (e.g. access type change, PLMN change, usage report, access
network information report).

### 4.1.2 Service Architecture

The 5G System Architecture is defined in 3GPP TS 23.501 \[2\]. The
Policy and Charging control related 5G architecture is also described in
3GPP TS 23.503 \[4\] and 3GPP TS 29.513 \[7\].

The only known NF service consumers of the Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization
service are the Application Function (AF) and the Network Exposure
Function (NEF).

The Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization service is provided by the PCF and
consumed by the AF and the NEF, as shown in figure 4.1.2-1 for the SBI
representation model and in figure 4.1.2-2 for the reference point
representation model.

Figure 4.1.2-1: Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization service Architecture, SBI
representation

Figure 4.1.2-2: Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization service Architecture,
reference point representation

The NEF can act as an AF using N5 reference point.

### 4.1.3 Network Functions

#### 4.1.3.1 Policy Control Function (PCF)

The PCF (Policy Control Function) is a functional element that
encompasses:

\- policy control decision and flow based charging control
functionalities;

\- access and mobility policy decisions for the control of e.g. the UE
Service Area Restrictions and RAT/RFSP control; and

\- UE Policy for the Access network discovery and selection policy and
UE Route Selection Policy (URSP).

The policy control decision and flow based charging control
functionalities enable the PCF to provide network control regarding the
service data flow detection, gating, QoS and flow based charging (except
credit management) towards the SMF/UPF.

The PCF receives session and media related information from the
Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization service consumers and notifies them of
subscribed traffic plane events.

The PCF may receive from the NF service consumers the request to monitor
the requested service and media information and notifies them of the
UL/DL/round-trip delay of the requested flows.

The PCF may receive service routing requirements and the indication of
receiving notifications about user plane path changes from the
Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization service consumers.

The PCF may receive from the NF service consumers the specific required
QoS and a prioritized list of alternative QoS profiles and notifies them
about the QoS target the access network guarantees.

The PCF checks that the service information provided by the NF service
consumer is consistent with the operator defined policy rules before
storing the service information.

The PCF uses the received service information and the subscription
information when it applies as basis for the policy and charging control
decisions.

The PCF derives PCC rules and provisions them to the SMF via the
Npcf\_SMPolicyControl service and subscribes to traffic plane events via
policy control request triggers as described in 3GPP TS 29.512 \[8\].

In 5GS interworking with TSN networks, the PCF:

\- notifies the TSN AF service consumer about the TSN bridge and DS-TT
port information corresponding to a PDU session;

\- enables the TSN AF configures the TSN bridge and TSN ports by
forwarding TSN bridge management containers and TSN port management
containers to the SMF as described in 3GPP TS 29.512 \[8\];

\- notifies the TSN AF about updated TSN bridge configuration and TSN
port configuration by forwarding TSN bridge management containers and
TSN port management containers received from the SMF; and

\- uses the received QoS and TSC assistance information to derive the
policy information delivered in the PCC rule to the SMF as described in
3GPP TS 29.512 \[8\].

#### 4.1.3.2 NF Service Consumers

The known NF service consumers are the AF and the NEF, as defined in
3GPP TS 23.502 \[3\].

The AF is an element offering control to applications that require the
policy and charging control of traffic plane resources; specific user
plane paths for the requested traffic, the monitoring of the required
service QoS, and/or specific QoS and alternative QoS profiles. The AF
uses the Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization service to provide service
information to the PCF.

In 5GS interworking with TSN networks, the TSN AF is an element offering
to TSN control functions an interface to 5GS to forward TSN bridge and
TSN port management configuration, and to set the QoS policy required to
forward the TSN traffic making use of the 5GS traffic plane resources.

The AFs can be deployed by the same operator offering the access
services or can be provided by external third-party service provider. If
the AF is not allowed by the operator to access directly the PCF, the AF
uses the external exposure framework via NEF to interact with the PCF,
as described in subclause 5.20 of 3GPP TS 23.501 \[2\].

The Network Exposure Function (NEF) supports external exposure of
capabilities of network functions.

4.2 Service Operations

3GPP TS 23.503 \[4\].

Figure 4.2.2.2-1 illustrates the initial provisioning of service
information.

Figure 4.2.2.2-1: Initial provisioning of service information

When a new AF application session context is being established and media
information for this application session context is available at the AF
and the related media requires PCC control, the AF shall invoke the
Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization\_Create service operation by sending the HTTP
POST request to the resource URI representing the \"Application
Sessions\" collection resource of the PCF, as shown in figure 4.2.2.2-1,
step 1.

The AF shall include in the \"AppSessionContext\" data type in the
payload body of the HTTP POST request a partial representation of the
\"Individual Application Session Context\" resource by providing the
\"AppSessionContextReqData\" data type. The \"Individual Application
Session Context\" resource and the \"Events Subscription\" sub-resource
are created as described below.

The AF shall provide in the body of the HTTP POST request:

\- for IP type PDU sessions, the IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) of the UE in
the \"ueIpv4\" or \"ueIpv6\" attribute; and

\- for Ethernet type PDU sessions, the MAC address of the UE in the
\"ueMac\" attribute.

\- if the \"TimeSensitiveNetworking\" feature is supported, the
\"ueMac\" attribute containing the MAC address of the DS-TT port as
received from the PCF during the reporting of bridge information as
defined in subclause 4.2.5.16.

NOTE: The determination of the DS-TT MAC address is specified in
subclause 5.28.2 of 3GPP TS 23.501 \[2\].

The AF shall provide the corresponding service information in the
\"medComponents\" attribute if available. The AF shall indicate to the
PCF as part of the \"medComponents\" attribute whether the service data
flow(s) (IP or Ethernet) should be enabled or disabled with the
\"fStatus\" attribute.

If the \"AuthorizationWithRequiredQoS\" feature as defined in
subclause 5.8 is supported, the AF may provide within the MediaComponent
data structure required QoS information as specified in
subclause 4.2.2.32.

The AF may include the AF application identifier in the \"afAppId\"
attribute into the body of the HTTP POST request in order to indicate
the particular service that the AF session belongs to.

The AF application identifier may be provided at both
\"AppSessionContextReqData\" data type level, and \"MediaComponent\"
data type level. When provided at both levels, the AF application
identifier provided at \"MediaComponent\" data type level shall have
precedence.

The AF application identifier at the \"AppSessionContextReqData\" data
type level may be used to trigger the PCF to indicate to the SMF/UPF to
perform the application detection based on the operator\'s policy as
defined in 3GPP TS 29.512 \[8\].

If the \"IMS\_SBI\" feature is supported, the AF may include the AF
charging identifier in the \"afChargId\" attribute for charging
correlation purposes.

If the \"TimeSensitiveNetworking\" feature is supported the AF may
provide TSN information as specified in subclauses 4.2.2.24 and
4.2.2.25.

The AF may also include the \"evSubsc\" attribute of
\"EventsSubscReqData\" data type to request the notification of certain
user plane events. The AF shall include the events to subscribe to in
the \"events\" attribute, and the notification URI where to address the
Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization\_Notify service operation in the \"notifUri\"
attribute. The events subscription is provisioned in the \"Events
Subscription\" sub-resource.

The AF shall also include the \"notifUri\" attribute in the
\"AppSessionContextReqData\" data type to indicate the URI where the PCF
can request to the AF the deletion of the \"Individual Application
Session Context\" resource.

If the PCF cannot successfully fulfil the received HTTP POST request due
to the internal PCF error or due to the error in the HTTP POST request,
the PCF shall send the HTTP error response as specified in
subclause 5.7.

Otherwise, when the PCF receives the HTTP POST request from the AF, the
PCF shall apply session binding as described in 3GPP TS 29.513 \[7\]. To
allow the PCF to identify the PDU session for which the HTTP POST
request applies, the AF shall provide in the body of the HTTP POST
request:

\- for IP type PDU session, either the \"ueIpv4\" attribute or
\"ueIpv6\" attribute containing the IPv4 or the IPv6 address applicable
to an IP flow or IP flows towards the UE; and

\- for Ethernet type PDU session, the \"ueMac\" attribute containing the
UE MAC address applicable to an Ethernet flow or Ethernet flows towards
the UE.

The AF may provide DNN in the \"dnn\" attribute, SUPI in the \"supi\"
attribute, GPSI in the \"gpsi\" attribute, the S-NSSAI in the
\"sliceInfo\" attribute if available for session binding. The AF may
also provide the domain identity in the \"ipDomain\" attribute.

NOTE 1: The \"ipDomain\" attribute is helpful in the following scenario:
Within a network slice instance, there are several separate IP address
domains, with SMF/UPF(s) that allocate Ipv4 IP addresses out of the same
private address range to UE PDU Sessions. The same IP address can thus
be allocated to UE PDU sessions served by SMF/UPF(s) in different
address domains. If one PCF controls several SMF/UPF(s) in different IP
address domains, the UE IP address is thus not sufficient for the
session binding. An AF can serve UEs in different IP address domains,
either by having direct IP interfaces to those domains, or by having
interconnections via NATs in the user plane between the UPF and the AF.
If a NAT is used, the AF obtains the IP address allocated to the UE PDU
session via application level signalling and supplies it for the session
binding to the PCF in the \"ueIpv4\" attribute. The AF supplies an
\"ipDomain\" attribute denoting the IP address domain behind the NAT in
addition. The AF can derive the appropriate value from the source
address (allocated by the NAT) of incoming user plane packets. The value
provided in the \"ipDomain\" attribute is operator configurable.

NOTE 2: The \"sliceInfo\" attribute is helpful in the scenario where
multiple network slice instances are deployed in the same DNN, and the
same IPv4 address may be allocated to UE PDU sessions in different
network slice instances. If one PCF controls several network slices, the
UE IP address is not sufficient for the session binding. The AF supplies
\"sliceInfo\" attribute denoting the network slice instance that
allocated the IPv4 address of the UE PDU session. How the AF derives
S-NSSAI is out of the scope of this specification.

NOTE 3: When the scenario described in NOTE 1 applies and the AF is a
P-CSCF it is assumed that the P-CSCF has direct IP interfaces to the
different IP address domains and that no NAT is located between the UPF
and P-CSCF. How a non-IMS AF obtains the UE private IP address to be
provided to the PCF is out of scope of the present release; it is
unspecified how to support applications that use a protocol that does
not retain the original UE's private IP address.

If the PCF fails in executing session binding, the PCF shall reject the
Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization\_Create service operation with an HTTP \"500
Internal Server Error\" response including the \"cause\" attribute set
to \"PDU\_SESSION\_NOT\_AVAILABLE\".

If the request contains the \"medComponents\" attribute the PCF shall
store the received service information. The PCF shall process the
received service information according to the operator policy and may
decide whether the request is accepted or not. The PCF may take the
priority information within the \"resPrio\" attribute into account when
making this decision.

If the service information provided in the body of the HTTP POST request
is rejected (e.g. the subscribed guaranteed bandwidth for a particular
user is exceeded), the PCF shall indicate in an HTTP \"403 Forbidden\"
response message the cause for the rejection including the \"cause\"
attribute set to \"REQUESTED\_SERVICE\_NOT\_AUTHORIZED\".

If the service information provided in the HTTP POST request is rejected
due to a temporary condition in the network (e.g. the NWDAF reported the
network slice selected for the PDU session is congested), the PCF may
include in the \"403 Forbidden\" response the \"cause\" attribute set to
\"REQUESTED\_SERVICE\_TEMPORARILY\_NOT\_AUTHORIZED\". The PCF may also
provide a retry interval within the \"Retry-After\" HTTP header field.
When the AF receives the retry interval within the \"Retry-After\" HTTP
header field, the AF shall not send the same service information to the
PCF again (for the same application session context) until the retry
interval has elapsed. The \"Retry-After\" HTTP header is described in
3GPP TS 29.500 \[5\] subclause 5.2.2.2.

The PCF may additionally provide the acceptable bandwidth within the
attribute \"acceptableServInfo\" included in the
\"ExtendedProblemDetails\" data structure returned in the rejection
response message.

To allow the PCF and SMF/UPF to perform PCC rule authorization and QoS
flow binding for the described service data flows, the AF shall supply:

\- for IP type PDU session, both source and destination IP addresses and
port numbers in the \"fDescs\" attribute within the \"medSubComps\"
attribute, if such information is available; and

\- for Ethernet type PDU session, the Ethernet Packet filters in the
\"ethfDescs\" attribute within the \"medSubComps\" attribute, if such
information is available.

The AF may specify the ToS traffic class within the \"tosTrCl\"
attribute for the described service data flows together with the
\"fDescs\" attribute.

The AF may include the \"resPrio\" attribute at the
\"AppSessionContextReqData\" data type level to assign a priority to the
AF Session as well as include the \"resPrio\" attribute at the
\"MediaComponent\" data type level to assign a priority to the service
data flow. The presence of the \"resPrio\" attribute in both levels does
not constitute a conflict as they each represent different types of
priority. The reservation priority at the \"AppSessionContextReqData\"
data type level provides the relative priority for an AF session while
the reservation priority at the \"MediaComponent\" data type level
provides the relative priority for a service data flow within a session.
If the \"resPrio\" attribute is not specified, the requested priority is
PRIO\_1.

The PCF shall check whether the received service information requires
PCC rules to be created and provisioned as specified in
3GPP TS 29.513 \[7\]. Provisioning of PCC rules to the SMF shall be
carried out as specified at 3GPP TS 29.512 \[8\].

Based on the received subscription information from the AF, the PCF may
create a subscription to event notifications for a related PDU session
from the SMF, as described in 3GPP TS 29.512 \[8\].

If the PCF created an \"Individual Application Session Context\"
resource, the PCF shall send to the AF a \"201 Created\" response to the
HTTP POST request, as shown in figure 4.2.2.2-1, step 2. The PCF shall
include in the \"201 Created\" response:

\- a Location header field; and

\- an \"AppSessionContext\" data type in the payload body.

The Location header field shall contain the URI of the created
individual application session context resource i.e.
\"{apiRoot}/npcf-policyauthorization/v1/app-sessions/{appSessionId}\".

When \"Events Subscription\" sub-resource is created in this procedure,
the AF shall build the sub-resource URI by adding the path segment
\"/events-subscription\" at the end of the URI path received in the
Location header field.

The \"AppSessionContext\" data type payload body shall contain the
representation of the created \"Individual Application Session Context\"
resource and may include the \"Events Subscription\" sub-resource.

The PCF shall include in the \"evsNotif\" attribute:

\- if the AF subscribed to the event \"PLMN\_CHG\" in the HTTP POST
request, the \"event\" attribute set to \"PLMN\_CHG\" and the \"plmnId\"
attribute including the PLMN identifier and, if available, the NID if
the PCF has previously requested to be updated with this information in
the SMF;

\- if the AF subscribed to the event \"ACCESS\_TYPE\_CHANGE\" in the
HTTP POST request, the \"event\" attribute set to
\"ACCESS\_TYPE\_CHANGE\" and:

> i\. the \"accessType\" attribute including the access type, and the
> \"ratType\" attribute including the RAT type when applicable for the
> notified access type; and
>
> ii\. if the \"ATSSS\" feature is supported, the \"addAccessInfo\"
> attribute with the additional access type information if available,
> where the access type is encoded in the \"accessType\" attribute, and
> the RAT type is encoded in the \"ratType\" attribute when applicable
> for the notified access type; and

NOTE 4: For a MA PDU session, if the \"ATSSS\" feature is not supported
by the AF the PCF includes the \"accessType\" attribute and the
\"ratType\" attribute with a currently active combination of access type
and RAT type (if applicable for the notifed access type). When both 3GPP
and non-3GPP accesses are available, the PCF includes the information
corresponding to the 3GPP access.

> iii\. the \"anGwAddr\" attribute including access network gateway
> address when available,

if the PCF has previously requested to be updated with this information
in the SMF; and

\- if the \"IMS\_SBI\" feature is supported and if the AF subscribed to
the \"CHARGING\_CORRELATION\" event in the HTTP POST request, the
\"event\" attribute set to \"CHARGING\_CORRELATION\" and may include the
\"anChargIds\" attribute containing the access network charging
identifier(s) and the \"anChargAddr\" attribute containing the access
network charging address.

The AF subscription to other specific events using the
Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization\_Create request is described in the related
subclauses. Notification of events when the applicable information is
not available in the PCF when receiving the
Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization\_Create request is described in
subclause 4.2.5.

The acknowledgement towards the AF should take place before or in
parallel with any required PCC rule provisioning towards the SMF.

NOTE 5: The behaviour when the AF does not receive the HTTP response
message, or when it arrives after the internal timer waiting for it has
expired, or when it arrives with an indication different than a success
indication, are outside the scope of this specification and based on
operator policy.

#### 4.2.2.3 Gate control

This procedure is used by an AF to instruct the PCF about when the
service data flow(s) are to be enabled or disabled for a PDU session.

The AF shall include in the HTTP POST request message described in
subclause 4.2.2.2 the \"fStatus\" attribute for the flows to be enabled
or disabled within the \"medComponents\" or \"medSubComps\" attributes.

If a \"medSubComps\" attribute contains a \"flowUsage\" attribute with
the value \"RTCP\", then the IP Flows described by that media
subcomponent shall be enabled in both directions irrespective of the
value of the \"fStatus\" attribute of the corresponding media component.

As result of this action, the PCF shall set the appropriate gate status
for the corresponding active PCC rule(s).

The PCF shall reply to the AF as described in subclause 4.2.2.2.

#### 4.2.2.4 Initial Background Data Transfer policy indication

This procedure is used by an AF to indicate a transfer policy negotiated
for background data transfer using the Npcf\_BDTPolicyControl service as
described in 3GPP TS 29.554 \[14\].

The AF may include in the HTTP POST request message described in
subclause 4.2.2.2 a reference identifier related to a transfer policy
negotiated for background data transfer in the \"bdtRefId\" attribute.

NOTE 1: The PCF will retrieve the corresponding transfer policy from the
UDR based on the reference identifier within the \"bdtRefId\" attribute.
In case only one PCF is deployed in the network, transfer policies can
be locally stored in the PCF and the interaction with the UDR is not
required.

If the PCF cannot retrieve the transfer policy, the PCF shall set to
TP\_NOT\_KNOWN the \"servAuthInfo\" attribute in the HTTP response
message to the AF to indicate that the transfer policy is unknown.

If the time window of the received transfer policy has expired, the PCF
shall set to TP\_EXPIRED the \"servAuthInfo\" attribute in the HTTP
response message to indicate to the AF that the transfer policy has
expired. Otherwise, if the time window of the received transfer policy
has not yet occurred, the PCF shall set to TP\_NOT\_YET\_OCCURRED the
\"servAuthInfo\" attribute in the HTTP response message to the AF to
indicate that the time window of the transfer policy has not yet
occurred.

NOTE 2: In the case that the PCF cannot retrieve the transfer policy,
the transfer policy time window has not yet occurred or the transfer
policy expired, the PCF makes the decision without considering the
transfer policy.

The PCF shall reply to the AF as described in subclause 4.2.2.2.

#### 4.2.2.5 Initial provisioning of sponsored connectivity information

This procedure is used by an AF to indicate sponsored data connectivity
when \"SponsoredConnectivity\" feature is supported.

The AF shall provide in the \"AppSessionContext\" data type of the HTTP
POST request message described in subclause 4.2.2.2 an application
service provider identity and a sponsor identity within the \"aspId\"
attribute and \"sponId\" attribute within the \"ascReqData\" attribute.
Additionally, the AF may provide an indication to the PCF of sponsored
data connectivity not enabled by including the \"sponStatus\" attribute
set to \"SPONSOR\_DISABLED\".

To support the usage monitoring of sponsored data connectivity, the AF
may subscribe with the PCF to the notification of usage threshold
reached. The AF shall include:

\- an entry of the \"AfEventSubscription\" data type in the \"events\"
attribute with the \"event\" attribute set to \"USAGE\_REPORT\"; and

\- the \"usgThres\" attribute of \"UsageThreshold\" data type in the
\"EventsSubscReqData\" data type with:

a\) the total volume in the \"totalVolume\" attribute; or

b\) the uplink volume only in the \"uplinkVolume\" attribute; or

c\) the downlink volume only in the \"downlinkVolume\"; and/or

d\) the time in the \"duration\" attribute.

NOTE 1: If the AF is in the user plane, the AF can handle the usage
monitoring and therefore it is not required to provide a usage threshold
to the PCF as part of the sponsored connectivity functionality.

When the AF indicated to enable sponsored data connectivity, and the UE
is roaming in a VPLMN, the following procedures apply:

\- If the AF is located in the HPLMN, for home routed roaming case and
when the operator policies do not allow accessing the sponsored data
connectivity with this roaming case, the H-PCF shall reject the service
request and shall include in the HTTP \"403 Forbidden\" response message
the \"cause\" attribute set to
\"UNAUTHORIZED\_SPONSORED\_DATA\_CONNECTIVITY\".

\- If the AF is located in the VPLMN, the V-PCF shall reject the service
request and shall include in the HTTP \"403 Forbidden\" response message
the \"cause\" attribute set to
\"UNAUTHORIZED\_SPONSORED\_DATA\_CONNECTIVITY\".

When the AF indicated to enable sponsored data connectivity, and the UE
is non-roaming or roaming with the home routed case and the operator
policies allow accessing the sponsored data connectivity with this
roaming case, the following procedures apply:

\- If the SMF does not support sponsored connectivity and the required
reporting level for that service indicates a sponsored connectivity
level according to 3GPP TS 29.512 \[8\], then the PCF shall reject the
request and shall include in the HTTP \"403 Forbidden\" response message
the \"cause\" attribute set to \"REQUESTED\_SERVICE\_NOT\_AUTHORIZED\".

\- If the SMF supports sponsored data connectivity feature or the
required reporting level is different from sponsored connectivity level
as described in 3GPP TS 29.512 \[8\], then the PCF, based on operator
policies, shall check whether it is required to validate the sponsored
connectivity data. If it is required, it shall perform the
authorizations based on sponsored data connectivity profiles. If the
authorization fails, the PCF shall include in the HTTP \"403 Forbidden\"
response message the \"cause\" attribute set to
\"UNAUTHORIZED\_SPONSORED\_DATA\_CONNECTIVITY\".

NOTE 2: The PCF is not required to verify that a trust relationship
exists between the operator and the sponsors.

The PCF shall reply to the AF as described in subclause 4.2.2.2.

#### 4.2.2.6 Subscriptions to Service Data Flow QoS notification control

The subscription to Service Data Flow QoS notification control is used
by an AF to subscribe to receive a notification when the GBR QoS targets
for one or more service data flows can no longer (or can again) be
guaranteed.

NOTE: It may happen that the GBR QoS targets for one or more PCC rules
(i.e. Service Data Flows) cannot be guaranteed, either permanently or
temporarily in the radio access network.

The AF shall use the \"EventsSubscReqData\" data type as described in
subclause 4.2.2.2 and shall include in the HTTP POST request message an
event within the \"events\" attribute with the \"event\" attribute set
to \"QOS\_NOTIF\".

The PCF shall reply to the AF as described in subclause 4.2.2.2.

As result of this action, the PCF shall set the appropriate subscription
to QoS notification control for the corresponding PCC rule(s) as
described in in 3GPP TS 29.512 \[8\].

#### 4.2.2.7 Subscription to Service Data Flow Deactivation

This procedure is used by an AF to subscribe to the notification of
deactivation of one or more Service Data Flows within the AF application
session context.

NOTE: It may happen that one or more PCC rules (i.e. Service Data Flows)
are deactivated at the SMF at certain time, either permanently or
temporarily, due to e.g. release of resources or out of credit
condition.

The AF shall use the \"EventsSubscReqData\" data type as described in
subclause 4.2.2.2 and shall include in the HTTP POST request message an
event within the \"events\" attribute with the \"event\" attribute set
to \"FAILED\_RESOURCES\_ALLOCATION\".

The PCF shall reply to the AF as described in subclause 4.2.2.2.

As result of this action, the PCF shall set the appropriate subscription
to service data flow deactivation for the corresponding PCC rule(s) as
described in in 3GPP TS 29.512 \[8\].

#### 4.2.2.8 Initial provisioning of traffic routing information

This procedure is used by an AF to:

\- influence SMF traffic routing decisions to a local access to a Data
Network identified by a DNAI; and/or

\- request subscriptions to notifications about UP path management
events related to the PDU session,

when \"InfluenceOnTrafficRouting\" feature is supported.

NOTE 1: The AF uses the Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization service for requests
targeting specific on-going PDU sessions of individual UE(s). The AF
requests that target existing or future PDU Sessions of multiple UE(s)
or any UE are sent via the NEF and may target multiple PCF(s), as
described in 3GPP TS 29.513 \[7\].

The AF shall include in the HTTP POST request message described in
subclause 4.2.2.2 the \"afRoutReq\" attribute of
\"AfRoutingRequirement\" data type with specific routing requirements
for the application traffic flows either within
\"AppSessionContextReqData\" data type for the service indicated in the
\"afAppId\" attribute, or within the \"medComponents\" attribute. When
provided at both levels, the \"afRoutReq\" attribute value in the
\"medComponents\" attribute shall have precedence over the \"afRoutReq\"
attribute included in the \"AppSessionContextReqData\" data type.

The AF may include traffic routing requirements together with service
information.

The AF may request to influence SMF traffic routing decisions to a DNAI.
The AF shall include in the \"afRoutReq\" attribute:

a\) A list of routes to locations of applications in the \"routeToLocs\"
attribute. Each element of the list shall contain:

\- a DNAI in the \"dnai\" attribute to indicate the location of the
application towards which the traffic routing is applied; and

\- either a routing profile identifier in the \"routeProfId\" attribute,
or the explicit routing information in the \"routeInfo\" attribute.

The AF may include in the \"afRoutReq\" attribute:

a\) Indication of application relocation possibility in the \"appReloc\"
attribute.

b\) Temporal validity during which the AF request is valid shall be
indicated with the \"startTime\" and \"stopTime\" attributes.

c\) Spatial validity during which the AF request is valid shall be
indicated in terms of validity areas encoded in the \"spVal\" attribute
of \"SpatialValidity\" data type. The \"SpatialValidity\" data type
consists of a list of presence areas included in the
\"presenceInfoList\" attribute, where each element shall include the
presence reporting area identifier in the \"praId\" attribute and may
include the elements composing a presence area encoded in the
attributes: \"trackingAreaList\", \"ecgList\", \"ncgList\",
\"globalRanNodeIdList\".

d\) Indication of UE IP address preservation in the \"addrPreserInd\"
attribute if the URLLC feature is supported.

The AF may also subscribe to notifications about UP path management
events. The AF shall include in the \"upPathChgSub\" attribute:

\- notifications of early and/or late DNAI change, using the attribute
\"dnaiChgType\" indicating whether the subscription is for \"EARLY\",
\"LATE\" or \"EARLY\_LATE\";

\- the notification URI where the AF is receiving the
Nsmf\_EventExposure\_Notify service operation in the \"notificationUri\"
attribute; and

\- the notification correlation identifier assigned by the AF in the
\"notifCorreId\" attribute.

If the URLLC feature is supported, the AF may include an indication of
AF acknowledgement to be expected as an \"afAckInd\" attribute within
the \"upPathChgSub\" attribute.

The PCF shall reply to the AF as described in subclause 4.2.2.2.

The PCF shall store the routing requirements included in the
\"afRoutReq\" attribute.

The PCF shall check whether the received routing requirements requires
PCC rules to be created or provisioned to include or modify traffic
steering policies, the AF transaction identifier and the application
relocation possibility as specified in 3GPP TS 29.513 \[7\].
Provisioning of PCC rules to the SMF shall be carried out as specified
in 3GPP TS 29.512 \[8\].

NOTE 2: The AF receives the notification about UP path management events
by the Nsmf\_EventExposure\_Notify service operation as defined in
subclause 4.2.2.2 of 3GPP TS 29.508 \[13\].

#### 4.2.2.9 Void

#### 4.2.2.10 Subscription to resources allocation outcome 

This procedure is used by an AF to subscribe to notifications when the
resources associated to the corresponding service information have been
allocated and/or cannot be allocated.

The AF shall use the \"EventsSubscReqData\" data type as described in
subclause 4.2.2.2 and shall include in the HTTP POST request message:

\- if the AF requests the PCF to provide a notification when the
resources associated to the service information have been allocated, an
event entry within the \"events\" attribute with the \"event\" attribute
set to \"SUCCESSFUL\_RESOURCES\_ALLOCATION\"; and/or

\- if the AF requests the PCF to provide a notification when the
resources associated to the service information cannot be allocated, an
event entry within the \"events\" attribute with the \"event\" attribute
set to \"FAILED\_RESOURCES\_ALLOCATION\".

The PCF shall reply to the AF as described in subclause 4.2.2.2.

As a result of this action, the PCF shall set the appropriate
subscription to notification of resources allocation outcome for the
corresponding PCC Rule(s) as described in 3GPP TS 29.512 \[8\].

#### 4.2.2.11 Void

#### 4.2.2.12 Invocation of Multimedia Priority Services

This procedure allows an AF, as per 3GPP TS 22.153 \[23\], to request
prioritized access to system resources in situations such as during
congestion.

The AF may include the \"mpsId\" attribute to indicate that the new AF
session relates to an MPS session.

The \"mpsId\" attribute shall contain the national variant for the MPS
service name indicating an MPS session. The \"resPrio\" attribute shall
include the priority value of the related priority service.

If the AF supports the SBI Message Priority mechanism for an MPS
session, it shall include the \"3gpp-Sbi-Message-Priority\" custom HTTP
header towards the PCF as described in subclause 6.8.2 of
3GPP TS 29.500 \[5\].

NOTE: If the AF supports the SBI Message Priority mechanism for an MPS
session, the AF will include the \"3gpp-Sbi-Message-Priority\" custom
HTTP header with a priority value equivalent to the value of the
\"resPrio\" attribute. Highest user priority value is mapped in the
corresponding lowest value of the \"3gpp-Sbi-Message-Priority\" custom
HTTP header.

When the PCF receives the \"mpsId\" attribute indicating an MPS session,
the PCF shall take specific actions on the corresponding PDU session to
ensure that the MPS session is prioritized as specified in
3GPP TS 29.512 \[8\].

#### 4.2.2.13 Support of content versioning

The support of the media component versioning is optional. When the
\"MediaComponentVersioning\" feature is supported, the AF and the PCF
shall comply with the procedures specified in this subclause.

If required by operator policies, the AF shall assign a content version
to the media component related to certain service and shall provide
assigned content version to the PCF in the \"contVer\" attribute
included in the corresponding media component entry of the
\"medComponents\" attribute.

If the PCF receives the \"contVer\" attribute for a certain media
component, the PCF shall follow the procedures described in
3GPP TS 29.512 \[8\], subclause 4.2.6.2.14.

#### 4.2.2.14 Request of access network information

This procedure is used by an AF to request the PCF to report the access
network information (i.e. user location and/or user timezone
information) at the creation of the \"Individual Application Session
Context\" resource, when the \"NetLoc\" feature is supported.

The AF shall include in the HTTP POST request message described in
subclause 4.2.2.2:

\- an entry of the \"AfEventSubscription\" data type in the \"events\"
attribute with:

a\) the \"event\" attribute set to the value \"ANI\_REPORT\"; and

b\) the \"notifMethod\" attribute set to the value \"ONE\_TIME\"; and

\- the \"reqAnis\" attribute, with the required access network
information, i.e. user location and/or user time zone information).

When the PCF determines that the access network does not support the
access network information reporting because the SMF does not support
the NetLoc feature, the PCF shall respond to the AF including in the
\"EventsNotification\" data type the \"noNetLocSupp\" attribute set to
\"ANR\_NOT\_SUPPORTED\" value. Otherwise, the PCF shall immediately
configure the SMF to provide such access information, as specified in
3GPP TS 29.512 \[8\].

The PCF shall reply to the AF with an HTTP response message as described
in subclause 4.2.2.2.

#### 4.2.2.15 Initial provisioning of service information status

When the \"IMS\_SBI\" feature is supported, the AF may provide the
status of the service information.

If the AF provides service information that has been fully negotiated
(e.g. based on the SDP answer), the AF may include the \"servInfStatus\"
attribute set to \"FINAL\". In this case the PCF shall authorize the
session and provision the corresponding PCC rules to the SMF.

The AF may additionally provide preliminary service information not
fully negotiated yet (e.g. based on the SDP offer) at an earlier stage.
To do so, the AF shall include the \"servInfStatus\" attribute set to
\"PRELIMINARY\". Upon receipt of such preliminary service information,
the PCF shall perform an early authorization check of the service
information. If the AF requests the PCF to report the access network
information together with preliminary service information, the PCF shall
immediately configure the SMF to provide the access network information.

#### 4.2.2.16 Provisioning of signalling flow information

This subclause is applicable when IMS restoration is supported according
to the supported feature \"ProvAFsignalFlow\" as described in
subclause 5.8.

This procedure allows an AF to provision information about the AF
signalling IP flows between the UE and the AF.

The AF shall provide:

\- the IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) of the UE in the \"ueIPv4\" or
\"ueIPv6\" attribute; and

\- a media component within the \"medComponents\" attribute including:

\- the \"medCompN\" attribute set to \"0\"; and

\- one or more media subcomponents within the \"medSubComps\" attribute
representing the AF signalling IP flows, where each media subcomponent
shall contain:

\- the \"flowUsage\" attribute set to the value \"AF\_SIGNALLING\";

\- the \"fNum\" attribute set according to the rules described in Annex
C;

\- the \"fDesc\" attribute containing the IP flows of the AF signalling
flow;

\- the \"fStatus\" set to the value \"ENABLED\"; and

\- the \"afSigProtocol\" set to the value corresponding to the
signalling protocol used between the UE and the AF.

The PCF shall perform session binding and shall reply to the AF as
described in subclause 4.2.2.2.

PCC rules related to the AF signalling IP flows could have been
provisioned to SMF using the corresponding procedures specified in
3GPP TS 29.512 \[8\] at an earlier stage (e.g. typically at the
establishment of the QoS flow for AF Signalling IP Flows). The PCF shall
install the corresponding dynamic PCC rule for the AF signalling IP
flows.

The AF may de-provision the information about the AF signalling IP flows
at any time. To do that, if the \"Individual Application Session
Context\" resource is only used to provide information about the AF
Signalling IP flows, the AF shall remove the resource by sending an
Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization\_Delete service operation as service operation
towards the PCF as defined in subclause 4.2.4.2. Otherwise, the AF shall
remove the IP flows within the media component invoking the
Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization\_Update service operation as defined in
subclause 4.2.3.17.

#### 4.2.2.17 Support of resource sharing

This procedure is used by an AF to indicate that a media component of an
Individual Application Session Context resource may share resources with
other media components in the related direction in other Individual
Application Session Context resources when the \"ResourceSharing\"
feature is supported.

The AF may include the \"sharingKeyUl\" attribute and/or
\"sharingKeyDl\" attribute within a media component of the
\"medComponents\" attribute to indicate that the related media of the
created new Individual Application Session Context resource may share
resources with other media components in the related direction that
include the same value for the \"sharingKeyUl\" attribute and/or
\"sharingKeyDl\" attribute.

The PCF shall reply to the AF with an HTTP response message as described
in subclause 4.2.2.2.

If the \"sharingKeyUl\" attribute and/or \"sharingKeyDl\" attribute are
provided within a media component of the \"medComponents\" attribute,
the PCF may apply the mechanisms for resource sharing as described in
3GPP TS 29.512 \[8\], subclause 4.2.6.2.8.

#### 4.2.2.18 Indication of Emergency traffic

When the \"IMS\_SBI\" feature is supported, this procedure allows an AF
to indicate that the new AF session context relates to emergency
traffic.

The AF may include the \"servUrn\" attribute to indicate that the new AF
session context relates to emergency traffic. Additionally, the AF may
include the \"afReqData\" attribute to indicate the additional
information requested for the AF session context.

When the PCF receives the \"servUrn\" attribute indicating an emergency
session, the PCF may apply special policies, for instance prioritising
service flows relating to the new AF session context or allowing these
service flows free of charge.

If the \"servUrn\" attribute indicates that the new AF session context
relates to emergency traffic and the \"afReqData\" attribute is
received, the PCF shall reply to the AF as described in
subclause 4.2.2.2 and shall provide the requested available user
information in the \"ueIds\" attribute included within the
\"ascRespData\" attribute in the HTTP \"201 Created\" response.

If the AF supports the SBI Message Priority mechanism for an emergency
session, it shall include the \"3gpp‑Sbi‑Message‑Priority\" custom HTTP
header towards the PCF as described in subclause 6.8.2 of
3GPP TS 29.500 \[5\].

NOTE: If the AF supports the SBI Message Priority mechanism for an
emergency session, the AF includes the \"3gpp-Sbi-Message-Priority\"
custom HTTP header based on AF policies in relation to valid values of
the \"servUrn\" attribute. The highest user priority value is mapped to
the corresponding lowest value of the \"3gpp-Sbi-Message-Priority\"
custom HTTP header.

When the new AF session context does not indicate emergency traffic and
the session binding function detects that the binding is to a PDU
session established to the Emergency DNN, the PCF shall reject the HTTP
POST request and shall indicate in an HTTP \"403 Forbidden\" response
message the cause for the rejection including the \"cause\" attribute
set to \"UNAUTHORIZED\_NON\_EMERGENCY\_SESSION\".

#### 4.2.2.19 Invocation of MCPTT

When the feature \"MCPTT\" is supported by the AF and the PCF, this
procedure allows an AF to request prioritized access to system resources
in situations such as an MCPTT session with priority call.

The AF may include the \"mcpttId\" attribute to indicate that the new
\"Individual Application Session Context\" resource relates to an MCPTT
session with priority call.

When the PCF receives the \"mcpttId\" attribute indicating an MCPTT
session and the \"resPrio\" attribute, the PCF shall take specific
actions on the corresponding PDU session to ensure that the MCPTT
session is prioritized as specified in 3GPP TS 29.512 \[8\].

Additionally, when the \"PrioritySharing\" feature is supported, the PCF
may receive the \"prioSharingInd\" attribute within the media component
received in the \"medComponents\" attribute as described in
subclause 4.2.2.21. In this case, and if \"MCPTT-Preemption\" feature is
supported, the PCF may receive pre-emption information as also described
in subclause 4.2.2.21.

For the handling of MCPTT session with priority call, see Annex B.13

#### 4.2.2.20 Invocation of MCVideo

When the feature \"MCVideo\" is supported by the AF and the PCF, this
procedure allows an AF to request prioritized access to system resources
in situations such as an MCVideo session with priority call.

The AF may include the \"mcVideoId\" attribute to indicate that the new
\"Individual Application Session Context\" resource relates to an
MCVideo session with priority call.

When the PCF receives the \"mcVideoId\" attribute indicating an MCVideo
session and the \"resPrio\" attribute, the PCF shall take specific
actions on the corresponding PDU session to ensure that the MCVideo
session is prioritized as specified in 3GPP TS 29.512 \[8\].

For the handling of MCVideo session with priority call, see Annex B.15

#### 4.2.2.21 Priority sharing indication

When the \"PrioritySharing\" feature is supported, the AF may indicate
to the PCF that the related media flow is allowed to use the same
Allocation and Retention Priority (ARP) as media flows belonging to
other \"Individual Application Session Context\" resources.

The AF may include the \"prioSharingInd\" attribute set to \"ENABLED\"
within a media component of the \"medComponents\" attribute to indicate
to the PCF that the related media flow is allowed to use the same
Allocation and Retention Priority as media flows which:

\- are assigned the same 5QI in the PCF; and

\- belong to other \"Individual Application Session Context\" resources
bound to the same PDU session that also contain the \"prioSharingInd\"
attribute set to \"ENABLED\".

If the \"MCPTT-Preemption\" feature is supported, the AF may also
include:

\- within a media component of the \"medComponents\" attribute, the
\"preemptCap\" attribute containing the suggested pre-emption capability
value and the \"preemptVuln\" attribute containing the suggested
pre-emption vulnerability value, for the PCF to determine ARP values;

\- within the \"ascReqData\" attribute in the request body, the
\"preemptControlInfo\" attribute containing the pre-emption control
information for the PCF to perform pre-emption control as described in
3GPP TS 29.512 \[8\], subclause 4.2.6.2.9; and

\- within the \"evSubsc\" attribute, the \"event\" attribute set to
\"FAILED\_RESOURCES\_ALLOCATION\" to request the notification for
resource allocation failure.

Upon reception of this information, the PCF shall behave as described in
3GPP TS 29.512 \[8\], subclause 4.2.6.2.9. For the handling of MCPTT
sessions, see Annex B.10.

NOTE 1: Service data flow deactivation procedures will apply according
to subclauses 4.2.2.7, 4.2.3.7, 4.2.5.5.

NOTE 2: This enhancement avoids the risk that a QoS flow establishment
request is rejected if the maximum number of active QoS flows is
exceeded.

The PCF shall reply to the AF with an HTTP response message as described
in subclause 4.2.2.2.

#### 4.2.2.22 Subscription to Out of Credit notification

This procedure is used by the AF if the \"IMS\_SBI\" feature is
supported to subscribe to notifications of credit not available for the
Service Data Flows within the AF application session context.

NOTE: It can happen that there are one or more PCC rules (i.e. Service
Data Flows) with credit not available, each one with their corresponding
termination action (terminate, redirect, access restricted).

The AF shall use the \"EventsSubscReqData\" data type as described in
subclause 4.2.2.2 and shall include in the HTTP POST request message an
event within the \"evSubsc\" attribute with the \"event\" attribute set
to the value \"OUT\_OF\_CREDIT\".

As result of this action, the PCF shall set the appropriate subscription
to out of credit notification for the corresponding PCC rule(s) as
described in 3GPP TS 29.512 \[8\].

The PCF shall reply to the AF with an HTTP response message as described
in subclause 4.2.2.2.

#### 4.2.2.23 Subscriptions to Service Data Flow QoS Monitoring Information

The subscription to Service Data Flow QoS monitoring information is used
by an AF to receive a notification about the packet delay between UPF
and UE, when the \"QoSMonitoring\" feature is supported.

The AF shall use the \"EventsSubscReqData\" data type as described in
subclause 4.2.2.2 and shall include:

\- the requested QoS monitoring parameter(s) to be measured (i.e. DL, UL
and/or round trip packet delay) within the \"reqQosMonParams\"
attribute;

\- an entry of the \"AfEventSubscription\" data type in the \"events\"
attribute with:

a\) the \"event\" attribute set to the value \"QOS\_MONITORING\"; and

b\) the \"notifMethod\" attribute set to the value \"EVENT\_DETECTION\"
or \"PERIODIC\"; and

c\) when the \"notifMethod\" attribute is set to the value \"PERIODIC\",
the reporting period within the \"repPeriod\" attribute; and

d\) when the \"notifMethod\" attribute set to the value
\"EVENT\_DETECTION\", the minimum waiting time between subsequent
reports within the \"waitTime\" attribute.

\- when the \"notifMethod\" attribute set to the value
\"EVENT\_DETECTION\", the \"qosMon\" attribute, with the required Qos
Monitoring information, i.e.:

\- the delay threshold for downlink with the \"repThreshDl\" attribute;

\- the delay threshold for uplink with the \"repThreshUl\" attribute;
and/or

\- the delay threshold for round trip with the \"repThreshRp\"
attribute.

The AF may include in \"EventsSubscReqData\" data type the notification
correlation identifier assigned by the AF within the \"notifCorreId\"
attribute.

The AF shall include more than one \"AfEventSubscription\" data type
within the \"EventsSubscReqData\" data type if more than one notify
method is required.

The PCF shall reply to the AF as described in subclause 4.2.2.2.

As result of this action, the PCF shall set the appropriate subscription
to QoS Monitoring information for the corresponding PCC rule(s) as
described in 3GPP TS 29.512 \[8\].

#### 4.2.2.24 Provisioning of TSCAI input Information and QoS related data

If the \"TimeSensitiveNetworking\" feature is supported the TSN AF may
provide TSCAI input information and QoS related data to the PCF by the
Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization\_Create service operation to describe the TSC
traffic pattern and QoS characteristics for use in the 5G System.

The TSN AF shall derive the TSCAI input information and the QoS related
data for a given TSN stream or flow of aggregated TSN streams as defined
in subclauses 5.27.2 and 5.28.4 of 3GPP TS 23.501 \[2\] respectively.

To indicate the TSCAI input information of a TSN stream or aggregated

The PCF shall reply to the TSN AF as described in subclause 4.2.2.2.

The PCF shall check whether the received TSCAI input container and TSC
QoS related data require to create PCC rules to provide the SMF with
derived QoS characteristics and the received TSCAI input container.
Provisioning of PCC rule(s) to the SMF shall be carried out as specified
in 3GPP TS 29.512 \[8\].

#### 4.2.2.25 Provisioning of bridge management information and port management information

If the \"TimeSensitiveNetworking\" feature is supported the AF may
provide a BMIC for the Bridge functionality of UPF/NW-TT and PMIC(s) for
the DS-TT port and/or the NW-TT ports to configure the 5G system as a
TSN bridge by invoking the Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization\_Create service
operation to the PCF.

The AF may include in the \"AppSessionContextReqData\" data type:

\- the DS-TT PMIC encoded in the attribute \"tsnPortManContDstt\" and/or
the one or more NW-TT PMIC(s) encoded in the \"tsnPortManContNwtts\"
attribute, if available, for the DS-TT port and NW-TT ports allocated
for a PDU session. The PMIC(s) are encoded in the
\"PortManagementContainer\" data type, which includes the port
management information in the \"portManCont\" attribute and the related
TSN port number in the \"portNum\" attribute; and/or

\- the BMIC encoded in the \"tsnBridgeManCont\", if available, for the

BMIC is encoded in the \"BridgeManagementContainer\" data type.

#### 4.2.2.26 Invocation of Mission Critical Services

This procedure allows an AF, as per 3GPP TS 22.179 \[45\], to request
prioritized access to system resources in situations such as during
congestion.

The AF may include the \"mcsId\" attribute to indicate that the new AF
session relates to an MCS session.

The \"mcsId\" attribute shall contain the national variant for the MCS
service name indicating an MCS session. The \"resPrio\" attribute shall
include the priority value of the related priority service.

If the AF supports the SBI Message Priority mechanism for an MCS
session, it shall include the \"3gpp-Sbi-Message-Priority\" custom HTTP
header towards the PCF as described in subclause 6.8.2 of
3GPP TS 29.500 \[5\].

NOTE: If the AF supports the SBI Message Priority mechanism for an MCS
session, the AF will include the \"3gpp-Sbi-Message-Priority\" custom
HTTP header with a priority value equivalent to the value of the
\"resPrio\" attribute. Highest user priority value is mapped in the
corresponding lowest value of the \"3gpp-Sbi-Message-Priority\" custom
HTTP header.

When the PCF receives the \"mcsId\" attribute indicating an MCS session,
the PCF shall take specific actions on the corresponding PDU session to
ensure that the MCS session is prioritised as specified in
3GPP TS 29.512 \[8\].

#### 4.2.2.27 P-CSCF restoration enhancements

The P-CSCF restoration custom operation is applicable when the PCF based
Restoration Enhancement, as defined in 3GPP TS 23.380 \[39\],
represented by the supported feature \"PCSCF-Restoration-Enhancement\"
is supported by both P-CSCF and PCF.

Figure 4.2.2.27-1 illustrates the P-CSCF restoration enhancements.

Figure 4.2.2.27-1: P-CSCF restoration enhancements

The P-CSCF acting as an AF shall invoke the \"P-CSCF restoration\"
custom operation sending an HTTP POST request to the resource URI
representing the custom operation (POST .../pcscf-restoration) as shown
in figure 4.2.2.27-1, step 1, in case P-CSCF restoration needs to be
performed.

The P-CSCF shall include in the \"PcscfRestorationRequestData\" data
type in the payload body of the HTTP POST request:

\- the IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) of the UE in the \"ueIpv4\" or
\"ueIpv6\" attribute, and if the IP address is not unique (e.g. private
IPv4 case), the \"ipDomain\" attribute or the \"sliceInfo\" attribute if
available; or

\- if the IP address is not available or if the IP address is not unique
and the \"ipDomain\" attribute and the \"sliceInfo\" attribute are not
available, the SUPI in the \"supi\" attribute and the DNN in the \"dnn\"
attribute.

The PCF shall identify the PDU session for which the HTTP POST request
applies. If the PCF fails in identifying the PDU session, the PCF shall
reject the \"P-CSCF restoration\" custom operation with an HTTP \"500
Internal Server Error\" response including the \"cause\" attribute set
to \"PDU\_SESSION\_NOT\_AVAILABLE\".

Otherwise, the PCF shall acknowledge the request and shall send to the
AF a \"204 No content\" response to the HTTP POST request, as shown in
figure 4.2.2.27-1, step 2.

The PCF shall send a request for P-CSCF restoration to the SMF for the
corresponding PDU session as described in 3GPP TS 29.512 \[8\],
subclause 4.2.3.18.

4.2.2.28 Support of CHEM feature

When CHEM feature is supported, the AF may include the value of Maximum
Packet Loss Rate for UL within the \"maxPacketLossRateUl\" attribute
and/or the value of Maximum Packet Loss Rate for DL within the
\"maxPacketLossRateDl\" attribute in \"medComponents\" attribute. For
CHEM feature, see Annex B.14.

#### 4.2.2.29 Support of FLUS feature

When \"FLUS\" feature is supported by the AF, the AF may include the
\"flusId\" attribute within a media component of the \"medComponents\"
attribute to indicate that the related media of the created new
Individual Application Session Context resource corresponds to a FLUS
media stream. Additional QoS information for the treatment of FLUS media
may be provided within \"desMaxLatency\" attribute and/or \"desMaxLoss\"
attribute.

#### 4.2.2.30 Subscription to EPS Fallback report

When the \"EPSFallbackReport\" feature is supported, the AF subscribes
to EPS Fallback report to be notified of the rejection in 5GS of the
requested resources associated to service information for voice media
type and the subsequent fallback to EPS of the resources associated to
the voice media and other medias requested by this AF.

The AF shall use the \"EventsSubscReqData\" data type as described in
subclause 4.2.2.2 and shall include in the HTTP POST request message an
event within the \"events\" attribute with the \"event\" attribute set
to \"EPS\_FALLBACK\". The AF shall request to the PCF to report EPS
Fallback in conjuction with providing the PCF with AF service
information for voice media type as described in subclause 4.2.2.2.

The PCF shall reply to the AF as described in subclause 4.2.2.2.

As result of this action, the PCF shall set the appropriate subscription
to EPS Fallback report for the corresponding PCC rule(s) as described in
in 3GPP TS 29.512 \[8\].

#### 4.2.2.31 Subscription to TSN related events

feature is supported to subscribe to notifications of updated 5GS Bridge
information, e.g., DS-TT PMIC and/or NW-TT PMIC(s) and/or BMIC
availability within the Individual Application Session Context resource
created to handle the TSN Bridge in the context of a PDU session.

The AF shall use the \"EventsSubscReqData\" data type as described in
subclause 4.2.2.2 and shall include in the HTTP POST request message
within the \"evSubsc\" attribute an event within \"events\" attribute
with the \"event\" attribute set to the value \"TSN\_BRIDGE\_INFO\" to
subscribe to the reception of 5GS Bridge information

The PCF shall reply to the AF with an HTTP response message as described
in subclause 4.2.2.2.

#### 4.2.2.32 Initial provisioning of required QoS information

This procedure is used by an AF to request that a data session to a UE
is set up with a specific QoS (e.g. low latency or jitter) and priority
handling when the \"AuthorizationWithRequiredQoS\" feature is supported.

The AF may provide within one or more entries of the \"medComponents\"
attribute included in the \"ascReqData\" attribute of the HTTP POST
request message described in subclause 4.2.2.2 a reference to
pre-defined QoS information within the \"qosReference\" attribute.

Additionally, if the AF supports adjustment to different QoS parameter
combinations, the AF may provide a prioritized list of one or more QoS
references within the \"altSerReqs\" attribute, where the lower the
index of the array for a given entry, the higher the priority. If the
\"DisableUENotification\" feature is supported, the AF may also indicate
to the PCF that the UE does not need to be informed about changes
related to Alternative QoS Profiles by including the \"disUeNotif\"
attribute set to true.

When the AF provides the \"altSerReqs\" attribute, the AF shall also
subscribe to receive notifications from the PCF when the resources
associated to the corresponding service information have been allocated
as described in subclause 4.2.2.10 and when the GBR QoS targets for one
or more service data flows can no longer (or can again) be guaranteed,
as described in subclause 4.2.2.6.

Due to the received QoS information, the PCF may need to provision or
modify the related PCC rules as specified in 3GPP TS 29.513 \[7\] and
provide the related information towards the SMF following the
corresponding procedures specified in 3GPP TS 29.512 \[8\].

The PCF shall reply to the AF as described in subclause 4.2.2.2.

#### 4.2.2.33 Support of QoSHint feature

If the QoSHint feature is supported by the AF, the AF may include the
\"desMaxLatency\" attribute and/or \"desMaxLoss\" attribute within a
media component of the \"medComponents\" attribute to indicate that the
related media of the created Individual Application Session Context
resource has specific latency and/or loss demands.

#### 4.2.2.34 Subscription to Reallocation of Credit notification

This procedure is used by the AF if the \"IMS\_SBI\" and the
\"ReallocationOfCredit\" features are supported to subscribe to
notifications of reallocation of credit for the Service Data Flows
within the AF application session context.

The AF shall use the \"EventsSubscReqData\" data type as described in

#### 4.2.3.2 Modification of service information

This procedure is used to modify an existing application session context
as defined in 3GPP TS 23.501 \[2\], 3GPP TS 23.502 \[3\] and
3GPP TS 23.503 \[4\] when the feature \"PatchCorrection\" is supported.

Figure 4.2.3.2-1 illustrates the modification of service information
using HTTP PATCH method.

Figure 4.2.3.2-1: Modification of service information using HTTP PATCH

The AF may modify the application session context information at any
time (e.g. due to an AF session modification or internal AF trigger) and
invoke the Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization\_Update service operation by
sending the HTTP PATCH request message to the resource URI representing
the \"Individual Application Session Context\" resource, as shown in
figure 4.2.3.2-1, step 1, with the modifications to apply.

The JSON body within the PATCH request shall include the
\"AppSessionContextUpdateDataPatch\" data type and shall be encoded
according to \"JSON Merge Patch\", as defined in IETF RFC 7396 \[21\].
The modifications to apply are encoded within the attributes of the
\"ascReqData\" attribute, as described below and in subsequent
subclauses.

The AF may include the updated service information in the
\"medComponents\" attribute of the \"ascReqData\" attribute.

If the \"AuthorizationWithRequiredQoS\" feature as defined in
subclause 5.8 is supported, the AF may provide within the
MediaComponentRm data structure an update of the required QoS
information as specified in subclause 4.2.3.30.

The AF may include in the \"ascReqData\" attribute an AF application
identifier in the \"afAppId\" attribute to trigger the PCF to indicate
to the SMF/UPF to perform the application detection based on the
operator\'s policy as defined in 3GPP TS 29.512 \[8\].

If the \"TimeSensitiveNetworking\" feature is supported, the AF may
provide TSN information as specified in subclauses 4.2.3.24 and
4.2.3.25.

The AF may also create, modify or remove events subscription information
by sending the HTTP PATCH request message to the resource URI
representing the \"Individual Application Session Context\" resource.

The AF shall create event subscription information by including in the
\"ascReqData\" attribute the \"evSubsc\" attribute of
\"EventsSubscReqDataRm\" data type with the corresponding list of events
to subscribe to; and the \"notifUri\" attribute with the notification
URI where the PCF shall send the notifications.

The AF shall update existing event subscription information by including
in the \"ascReqData\" attribute an updated value of the \"evSubsc\"
attribute of the \"EventsSubscReqDataRm\" data type as follows:

\- The \"events\" attribute shall include the new complete list of
subscribed events.

\- When the AF requests to update the additional information related to
an event (e.g. the AF needs to provide new thresholds to the PCF in the
\"usgThres\" attribute related to the \"USAGE\_REPORT\" event) the AF
shall include the additional information, which shall completely replace
the previously provided one.

NOTE 1: Note that when the AF requests to remove an event, this event is
not included in the \"events\" attribute.

NOTE 2: When an event is included in the \"events\" attribute and its
related additional information is set to null, the PCF considers the
subscription to this event is active, but the related procedures stop
applying.

NOTE 3: When an event is removed from the \"events\" attribute but its
related information is not set to null, the PCF considers the
subscription to this event is terminated, the related additional
information is removed, and the related procedures stop applying.

The AF shall remove existing event subscription information by setting
to null the \"evSubsc\" attribute included in the \"ascReqData\"
attribute.

Events with \"notifMethod\" set to \"ONE\_TIME\" shall only apply at the
time the AF requests their subscription. Once the event report is
performed, the subscription to this event is automatically terminated in
the PCF and the related information is removed. The presence of a
one-time event, together with its related additional information when
applicable, during an update procedure shall represent the recreation of
the subscription to this event in the PCF.

NOTE 4: The \"notifUri\" attribute within the EventsSubscReqData data
structure can be modified to request that subsequent notifications are
sent to a new NF service consumer.

If the PCF cannot successfully fulfil the received HTTP PATCH request
due to the internal PCF error or due to the error in the HTTP PATCH
request, the PCF shall send the HTTP error.

If the feature \"ES3XX\" is supported, and the PCF determines the
received HTTP PATCH request needs to be redirected, the PCF shall send
an HTTP redirect response as specified in subclause 6.10.9 of
3GPP TS 29.500 \[5\].

Otherwise, the PCF shall process the received service information
according the operator policy and may decide whether the HTTP request
message is accepted or not.

If the updated service information is not acceptable (e.g. the
subscribed guaranteed bandwidth for a particular user is exceeded), the
PCF shall include in an HTTP \"403 Forbidden\" response message the
\"cause\" attribute set to \"REQUESTED\_SERVICE\_NOT\_AUTHORIZED\".

If the service information provided in the HTTP PATCH request is
rejected due to a temporary condition in the network (e.g. the NWDAF
reported the network slice selected for the PDU session is congested),
the PCF may include in the \"403 Forbidden\" response the \"cause\"
attribute set to \"REQUESTED\_SERVICE\_TEMPORARILY\_NOT\_AUTHORIZED\".
The PCF may also provide a retry interval within the \"Retry-After\"
HTTP header field. When the AF receives the retry interval within the
\"Retry-After\" HTTP header field, the AF shall not send the same
service information to the PCF again (for the same application session
context) until the retry interval has elapsed. The \"Retry-After\" HTTP
header is described in 3GPP TS 29.500 \[5\] subclause 5.2.2.2.

The PCF may additionally provide the acceptable bandwidth within the
attribute \"acceptableServInfo\" included in the
\"ExtendedProblemDetails\" data structure returned in the rejection
response message.

If the request is accepted, the PCF shall update the service information
with the new information received. Due to the updated service
information, the PCF may need to create, modify or delete the related
PCC rules as specified in 3GPP TS 29.513 \[7\] and provide the updated
information towards the SMF following the corresponding procedures
specified in 3GPP TS 29.512 \[8\].

Based on the received subscription information from the AF, the PCF may
create a subscription to event notifications or may modify the existing
subscription to event notifications, for a related PDU session from the
SMF, as described in 3GPP TS 29.512 \[8\].

The PCF shall reply with the HTTP response message to the AF and may
include the \"AppSessionContext\" data type payload body with the
representation of the modified \"Individual Application Session
Context\" resource and may include the \"Events Subscription\"
sub-resource.

The PCF shall include in the \"evsNotif\" attribute:

\- if the AF subscribed to the \"PLMN\_CHG\" event in the HTTP PATCH
request, the \"event\" attribute set to \"PLMN\_CHG\" and the \"plmnId\"
attribute including the PLMN identifier and, if available, the NID if
the PCF has previously requested to be updated with this information in
the SMF;

\- if the AF subscribed to the event \"ACCESS\_TYPE\_CHANGE\" event in
the HTTP PATCH request, the \"event\" attribute set to
\"ACCESS\_TYPE\_CHANGE\" and: the attributes

> i\. the \"accessType\" attribute including the access type, and the
> \"ratType\" attribute including the RAT type when applicable for the
> notified access type; and
>
> ii\. if the \"ATSSS\" feature is supported, the \"addAccessInfo\"
> attribute with the additional access type information if available,
> where the access type is encoded in the \"accessType\" attribute, and
> the RAT type is encoded in the \"ratType\" attribute when applicable
> for the notified access type; and

NOTE 5: For a MA PDU session, if the \"ATSSS\" feature is not supported
by the AF the PCF includes the \"accessType\" attribute and the
\"ratType\" attribute with a currently active combination of access type
and RAT type (if applicable for the notifed access type). When both 3GPP
and non-3GPP accesses are available, the PCF includes the information
corresponding to the 3GPP access.

> iii\. the \"anGwAddr\" attribute including access network gateway
> address when available,

if the PCF has previously requested to be updated with this information
in the SMF; and

\- if the \"IMS\_SBI\" feature is supported and if the AF subscribed to
the \"CHARGING\_CORRELATION\" event in the HTTP PATCH request, the
\"event\" attribute set to \"CHARGING\_CORRELATION\" and may include the
\"anChargIds\" attribute containing the access network charging
identifier(s) and the \"anChargAddr\" attribute containing the access
network charging address.

The AF subscription to other specific events using the
Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization\_Update request is described in the related
subclauses. Notification of events when the applicable information is
not available in the PCF when receiving the
Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization\_Update request is described in
subclause 4.2.5.

The HTTP response message towards the AF should take place before or in
parallel with any required PCC rule provisioning towards the SMF.

If the PCF does not have an existing application session context for the
application session context being modified (such as after a PCF
failure), the PCF shall reject the HTTP request message with the HTTP
response message with the applicable rejection cause.

#### 4.2.3.3 Gate control

This procedure is used by an AF to modify in the PCF the service data
flow(s) that are to be enabled or disabled to pass through the PDU
session.

The AF shall use the HTTP PATCH method to modify the gate control
information.

The AF shall include in the HTTP PATCH request message described in
subclause 4.2.3.2, in the \"ascReqData\" attribute, in the media
component(s) included in the \"medComponents\" attribute at media and/or
media subcomponent level, the \"fStatus\" attribute for the flows to be
enabled or disabled with the appropriate value.

If a \"medSubComps\" attribute contains a \"flowUsage\" attribute with
the value \"RTCP\", then the IP Flows described by that media
subcomponent shall be enabled in both directions irrespective of the
value of the \"fStatus\" attribute of the corresponding media component.

As result of this action, the PCF shall set the appropriate gate status
for the corresponding active PCC rule(s).

The PCF shall reply to the AF as described in subclause 4.2.3.2.

#### 4.2.3.4 Background Data Transfer policy indication at policy authorization update

This procedure is used by an AF to indicate at policy authorization
update a transfer policy negotiated for background data transfer using
the Npcf\_BDTPolicyControl service as described in
3GPP TS 29.554 \[14\].

The AF may include in the HTTP PATCH request message described in
subclause 4.2.3.2, in the \"ascReqData\" attribute, a new reference id
in the \"bdtRefId\" attribute.

NOTE 1: The PCF will retrieve the corresponding transfer policy from the
UDR based on the reference identifier within the \"bdtRefId\" attribute.
In case only one PCF is deployed in the network, transfer policies can
be locally stored in the PCF and the interaction with the UDR is not
required.

If the PCF cannot retrieve the transfer policy, the PCF shall set to
TP\_NOT\_KNOWN the \"servAuthInfo\" attribute in the HTTP response
message to the AF to indicate that the transfer policy is unknown.

If the time window of the received transfer policy has expired, the PCF
shall set to TP\_EXPIRED the \"servAuthInfo\" attribute in the HTTP
response message to indicate to the AF that the transfer policy has
expired. Otherwise, if the time window of the received transfer policy
has not yet occurred, the PCF shall set to TP\_NOT\_YET\_OCCURRED the
\"servAuthInfo\" attribute in the HTTP response message to the AF to
indicate that the time window of the transfer policy has not yet
occurred.

NOTE 2: In the case that the PCF cannot retrieve the transfer policy,
the transfer policy time window has not yet occurred or the transfer
policy expired, the PCF makes the decision without considering the
transfer policy.

The PCF shall reply to the AF as described in subclause 4.2.3.2.

#### 4.2.3.5 Modification of sponsored connectivity information

This procedure is used by an AF to modify sponsored data connectivity
when \"SponsoredConnectivity\" feature is supported.

The AF shall use the HTTP PATCH method to modify the sponsored
connectivity information.

The AF shall include in the HTTP PATCH request message described in
subclause 4.2.3.2, in the \"ascReqData\" attribute, an application
service provider identity and a sponsor identity within the \"aspId\"
attribute and \"sponId\" attribute, and optionally an indication of
whether to enable or disable sponsored data connectivity within the
\"sponStatus\" attribute set to the applicable value to provide
sponsored connectivity information or to update existing sponsored
connectivity information.

If the AF requests to enable sponsored data connectivity the AF shall
change the \"sponStatus\" attribute value to \"SPONSOR\_ENABLED\".

If the AF requests to disable sponsored data connectivity the AF shall
provide an indication to disable sponsored data connectivity to the PCF
by setting the \"sponStatus\" attribute to \"SPONSOR\_DISABLED\".

To support the usage monitoring of sponsored data connectivity, the AF
may also include in the HTTP PATCH a new or modified \"evSubsc\"
attribute of \"EventsSubscReqDataRm\" data type with:

\- the usage thresholds to apply in the \"usgThres\" attribute; and

\- the subscription to usage monitoring for sponsored data connectivity
in an entry of the \"events\" attribute of the \"AfEventSubscription\"
data type with the \"event\" attribute set to \"USAGE\_REPORT\".

NOTE 1: If the AF is in the user plane, the AF can handle the usage
monitoring and therefore it is not required to provide a usage threshold
to the PCF as part of the sponsored data connectivity information.

When the AF indicated to enable sponsored data connectivity, and the UE
is roaming with the visited access case, the following procedures apply:

\- If the AF is located in the HPLMN, for home routed roaming case and
when operator policies do not allow accessing the sponsored data
connectivity with this roaming case, the H-PCF shall reject the service
request and shall include in the HTTP \"403 Forbidden\" response message
the \"cause\" attribute set to
\"UNAUTHORIZED\_SPONSORED\_DATA\_CONNECTIVITY\".

\- If the AF is located in the VPLMN, the V-PCF shall reject the service
request and shall include in the HTTP \"403 Forbidden\" response message
the \"cause\" attribute set to
\"UNAUTHORIZED\_SPONSORED\_DATA\_CONNECTIVITY\".

When the AF indicated to enable sponsored data connectivity, and the UE
is in the non-roaming case or roaming with the home routed case and the
operator policies allow accessing the sponsored data connectivity with
this roaming case, the following procedures apply:

\- If the SMF does not support sponsored connectivity and the required
reporting level for that service indicates a sponsored connectivity
level according to 3GPP TS 29.512 \[8\], then the PCF shall reject the
request and shall include in the HTTP \"403 Forbidden\" response message
the \"cause\" attribute set to \"REQUESTED\_SERVICE\_NOT\_AUTHORIZED\".

\- If the SMF supports sponsored data connectivity feature or the
required reporting level is different from sponsored connectivity level
as described in 3GPP TS 29.512 \[8\], then the PCF, based on operator
policies, shall check whether it is required to validate the sponsored
connectivity data. If it is required, it shall perform the
authorizations based on sponsored data connectivity profiles. If the
authorization fails, the PCF shall include in the HTTP \"403 Forbidden\"
response message the \"cause\" attribute set to
\"UNAUTHORIZED\_SPONSORED\_DATA\_CONNECTIVITY\".

NOTE 2: The PCF is not required to verify that a trust relationship
exists between the operator and the sponsors.

The PCF shall reply to the AF as described in subclause 4.2.3.2.

#### 4.2.3.6 Modification of Subscription to Service Data Flow QoS notification control

This procedure is used in the AF to modify in the PCF the subscription
to notification about whether the GBR QoS targets can no longer (or can
again) be guaranteed.

The AF shall use the HTTP PATCH method to update the \"Events
Subscription\" sub-resource together with the modifications to the
\"Individual Application Session Context\" resource.

The AF shall include in the HTTP PATCH request message described in
subclause 4.2.3.2, in the \"ascReqData\" attribute, the updated values
of the \"EventsSubscReqDataRm\" data type, which either shall include in
the \"events\" attribute a new element with the \"event\" attribute set
to \"QOS\_NOTIF\" to indicate the subscription to QoS notification
control, or shall not include in the \"events\" attribute an existing
element with the \"event\" attribute set to \"QOS\_NOTIF\" to indicate
the termination of the subscription to QoS notification control.

As result of this action, the PCF shall set the appropriate subscription
to QoS notification control for the corresponding active PCC rule(s) as
described in 3GPP TS 29.512 \[8\].

The PCF shall reply to the AF as described in subclause 4.2.3.2.

#### 4.2.3.7 Modification of Subscription to Service Data Flow Deactivation

This procedure is used by an AF to modify in the PCF the subscription to
the notification of deactivation of one or more Service Data Flows
within the AF application session context.

The AF shall use the HTTP PATCH method to update the \"Events
Subscription\" sub-resource together with the modifications to the
\"Individual Application Session Context\" resource.

The AF shall include in the HTTP PATCH request message described in
subclause 4.2.3.2, in the \"ascReqData\" attribute, the updated values
of the \"EventsSubscReqDataRm\" data type, which either shall include in
the \"events\" attribute a new element with the \"event\" attribute set
to \"FAILED\_RESOURCES\_ALLOCATION\" to indicate the subscription to
service data flow deactivation, or shall not include in the \"events\"
attribute an existing element with the \"event\" attribute set to
\"FAILED\_RESOURCES\_ALLOCATION\".

The PCF shall reply to the AF as described in subclause 4.2.3.2.

As result of this action, the PCF shall set the appropriate subscription
to service data flow deactivation for the corresponding PCC rule(s) as
described in in 3GPP TS 29.512 \[8\].

#### 4.2.3.8 Update of traffic routing information

This procedure is used by an AF to modify in the PCF the traffic routing
information to a local access to a DNN, and/or to modify the
subscription to notifications about UP path management when
\"InfluenceOnTrafficRouting\" feature is supported.

The AF shall use the HTTP PATCH method.

To modify traffic routing information, the AF shall include in the HTTP
PATCH request message described in subclause 4.2.3.2, in the
\"ascReqData\" attribute, an updated \"afRoutReq\" attribute(s) with the
modified traffic routing information.

To modify the subscription to notifications about UP path management
events (create, delete or modify), the AF shall include in the HTTP
PATCH request message described in subclause 4.2.3.2, in the
\"ascReqData\" attribute, the updated values of the \"upPathChgSub\"
attribute with the modified subscription to UP path management events.

The PCF shall reply to the AF as described in subclause 4.2.3.2.

The PCF shall store the application routing requirements included in the
\"afRoutReq\" attribute.

The PCF shall check whether the updated application routing requirements
require PCC rules to be created or modified to include updated traffic
steering policies, or the AF transaction identifier, or to update the
application relocation possibility as specified in 3GPP TS 29.513 \[7\].
Provisioning of PCC rules to the SMF shall be carried out as specified
at 3GPP TS 29.512 \[8\].

#### 4.2.3.9 Void

#### 4.2.3.10 Modification of subscription to resources allocation outcome

This procedure is used in the AF to modify in the PCF the subscription
to notification about resources allocation outcome.

The AF shall use the HTTP PATCH method to update the \"Events
Subscription\" sub-resource together with the modifications to the
\"Individual Application Session Context\" resource.

The AF shall include in the HTTP PATCH request message described in
subclause 4.2.3.2, in the \"ascReqData\" attribute, the updated values
of the \"EventsSubscReqDataRm\" data type, which either include in the
\"events\" attribute a new element with the \"event\" attribute set to
\"SUCCESSFUL\_RESOURCES\_ALLOCATION\" and/or
\"FAILED\_RESOURCES\_ALLOCATION\" or remove in the \"events\" attribute
an existing element with the \"event\" attribute set to
\"SUCCESSFUL\_RESOURCES\_ALLOCATION\" and/or
\"FAILED\_RESOURCES\_ALLOCATION\".

As a result of this action, the PCF shall set the appropriate
subscription to notification of resources allocation outcome in the
corresponding PCC Rule(s) as described in 3GPP TS 29.512 \[8\].

#### 4.2.3.11 Void

#### 4.2.3.12 Modification of Multimedia Priority Services

The AF may include, in the \"ascReqData\" attribute, the \"mpsId\"
attribute if it was not previously provided in order to indicate that
the modified AF session relates to an MPS session.

If the AF supports the SBI message priority mechanism for an MPS
session, the AF shall include the \"3gpp-Sbi-Message-Priority\" custom
HTTP header towards the PCF as described in subclause 4.2.2.12.

If the PCF receives the \"mpsId\" attribute, the PCF shall take specific
actions on the corresponding PDU session to ensure that the MPS session
is prioritized as defined in 3GPP TS 29.512 \[8\].

#### 4.2.3.13 Support of content versioning

The support of the media component versioning is optional. When the
\"MediaComponentVersioning\" feature is supported, the AF and the PCF
shall comply with the procedures specified in this subclause.

Upon each media component modification encoded in the \"medComponents\"
attribute included in the \"ascReqData\" attribute, if the content
version was previously assigned to a media component, the AF shall
assign a new content version. All the content related to that media
component shall be included and the content version shall be unique for
the lifetime of the media component.

NOTE: The AF will include all the content of the media component in each
media component modification in order to ensure that the media component
is installed with the proper information regardless of the outcome of
the QoS flow procedure related to previous interactions that are not
reported to the PCF yet.

If the PCF receives the \"contVer\" attribute for a certain media
component, the PCF shall follow the procedures described in
3GPP TS 29.512 \[8\], subclause 4.2.6.2.14.

#### 4.2.3.14 Request of access network information

This procedure is used by an AF to request access network information
for an existing \"Individual Application Session Context\" resource at
service information modification when the \"NetLoc\" feature is
supported.

NOTE 1: Subclause 4.2.6.6 describes the AF request of access network
information without providing service information.

The AF shall create event subscription information by including in the
\"AppSessionContextUpdateData\" data type the \"evSubsc\" attribute of
\"EventsSubscReqData\" data type with the corresponding list of events
to subscribe to.

The AF shall include in the HTTP PATCH request message described in
subclause 4.2.3.2, in the \"ascReqData\" attribute:

\- an entry of the \"AfEventSubscription\" data type in the \"events\"
attribute with:

a\) the \"event\" attribute set to the value \"ANI\_REPORT\"; and

b\) the \"notifMethod\" attribute set to the value \"ONE\_TIME\"; and

\- the \"reqAnis\" attribute, with the required access network
information, i.e. user location and/or user time zone information).

When the PCF determines that the access network does not support the
access network information reporting because the SMF does not support
the NetLoc feature, the PCF shall respond to the AF including in the
\"EventsNotification\" data type the \"noNetLocSupp\" attribute set to
\"ANR\_NOT\_SUPPORTED\" value. Otherwise, the PCF shall immediately
configure the SMF to provide such access information, as specified in
3GPP TS 29.512 \[8\].

The PCF shall reply to the AF with an HTTP response message as described
in subclause 4.2.3.2.

NOTE 2: The AF does not invoke the Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization\_Update
service operation to remove subscription to access network information
report since the \"Access Network Information Notification\" is the
one-time reported event. Once the access network information is reported
to the AF the subscription to the access network information report is
automatically terminated in the PCF and the related information is
removed.

#### 4.2.3.15 Modification of service information status

When the \"IMS\_SBI\" feature is supported, the AF may update the status
of the service information. If the AF provides service information that
has been fully negotiated (e.g. based on the SDP answer), the AF may
include in the \"ascReqData\" attribute the \"servInfStatus\" attribute
set to \"FINAL\". In this case the PCF shall authorize the session and
provision the corresponding PCC rules to the SMF.

The AF may additionally provide preliminary service information not
fully negotiated yet (e.g. based on the SDP offer) at an earlier stage.
To do so, the AF shall include the \"servInfStatus\" attribute set to
\"PRELIMINARY\". Upon receipt of such preliminary service information,
the PCF shall perform an early authorization check of the service
information. If the AF requests the PCF to report the access network
information together with preliminary service information, the PCF shall
immediately configure the SMF to provide the access network information.

#### 4.2.3.16 Support of SIP forking

When the \"IMS\_SBI\" feature is supported, this procedure is used by an
AF to indicate that an existing \"Individual Application Session
Context\" resource comprises service information about several SIP
dialogues.

The AF shall use the HTTP PATCH method to modify the service
information.

The AF may include in the HTTP PATCH request message described in
subclause 4.2.3.2, in the \"ascReqData\" attribute, the \"sipForkInd\"
attribute and include the updated service information.

The PCF shall reply to the AF as described in subclause 4.2.3.2.

When the \"sipForkInd\" attribute gets the value:

\- \"SEVERAL\_DIALOGUES\", the PCF shall send additional PCC rules or
individual data flow filters to already provided PCC rules as described
in Annex B.3.1.

\- \"SINGLE\_DIALOGUE\", the PCF shall update installed PCC rules and
Authorized-QoS information as described in Annex B.3.2.

#### 4.2.3.17 Provisioning of signalling flow information

This procedure is used by an AF to provision or de-provision information
about the AF signalling IP flows between the UE and the AF.

The AF shall include in the HTTP PATCH request message described in
subclause 4.2.3.2, in the \"ascReqData\" attribute:

\- when the procedure is used to provision information about the AF
signalling IP flows, a media component within the \"medComponents\"
attribute including the attributes described in subclause 4.2.2.16;

\- when the procedure is used to de-provision information about the AF
signalling IP flows, for the media subcomponents containing the AF
signalling IP flows, the \"fStatus\" attribute set to the value
\"REMOVED\".

The PCF shall reply to the AF as described in subclause 4.2.3.2.

#### 4.2.3.18 Support of resource sharing

When the \"ResourceSharing\" is supported by the AF and the PCF, the AF
may include, in the \"ascReqData\" attribute, the \"sharingKeyUl\"
attribute and/or \"sharingKeyDl\" attribute within a media component of
the \"medComponents\" attribute to indicate to the PCF that the related
media of the modified Individual Application Session Context resource
may share resources with other media components in the related direction
that include the same value in the \"sharingKeyUl\" attribute and/or
\"sharingKeyDl\" attribute.

The AF may modify the conditions for resource sharing by including the
media component within the \"medComponents\" attribute with a new value
for the \"sharingKeyUl\" attribute and/or \"sharingKeyDl\" attribute.
The AF may indicate that the related media of the modified Individual
Application Session resource is not sharing resources with other media
components in the related direction setting the \"sharingKeyUl\"
attribute and/or \"sharingKeyDl\" attribute to \"null\".

The AF shall use the HTTP PATCH method to update the \"Individual
Application Session Context resource\" as described in
subclause 4.2.3.2.

If the \"sharingKeyUl\" attribute and/or \"sharingKeyDl\" attribute are
provided within a media component of the \"medComponents\" attribute,
the PCF may apply the mechanisms for resource sharing as described in
3GPP TS 29.512 \[8\], subclause 4.2.6.2.8.

#### 4.2.3.19 Modification of MCPTT

The AF may include, in the \"ascReqData\" attribute, the \"mcpttId\"
attribute in order to indicate that the modified \"Individual
Application Session Context\" resource relates to the priority
adjustment of an MCPTT session. When the PCF receives the \"mcpttId\"
attribute related to that MCPTT session, the PCF may take specific
actions on the corresponding PDU session to ensure that the MCPTT
session is prioritized. For the handling of MCPTT session with priority
call, see Annex B.13.

Additionally, when the \"PrioritySharing\" feature is supported, the PCF
may receive the \"prioSharingInd\" attribute within the media component
received in the \"medComponents\" attribute as described in
subclause 4.2.2.21. In this case, and if \"MCPTT-Preemption\" feature is
supported, the PCF may receive pre-emption information as also described
in subclause 4.2.3.21.

#### 4.2.3.20 Modification of MCVideo

The AF may include, in the \"ascReqData\" attribute, the \"mcVideoId\"
attribute in order to indicate that the modified \"Individual
Application Session Context\" resource relates to the priority
adjustment of an MCVideo session. When the PCF receives the
\"mcVideoId\" attribute related to that MCVideo session, the PCF may
take specific actions on the corresponding PDU session to ensure that
the MCVideo session is prioritized. For the handling of MCVideo session
with priority call, see Annex B.15.

#### 4.2.3.21 Priority sharing indication

When the \"PrioritySharing\" feature is supported, the AF may include
the \"prioSharingInd\" attribute set to \"ENABLED\" within a media
component of the \"medComponents\" attribute included in the
\"ascReqData\" attribute to indicate to the PCF that the related media
flow is allowed to use the same Allocation and Retention Priority (ARP)
as media flows belonging to other \"Individual Application Session
Context\" resources as described in subclause 4.2.2.21. In this case, if
the \"MCPTT-Preemption\" feature is supported, the AF may also include
the \"preemptCap\", \"preemptVuln\" and \"preemptControlInfo\"
attributes as described in subclause 4.2.2.21.

When the \"preemptControlInfo\" attribute is modified, the latest
provided value shall be applied to all potential media flow candidates.

If the AF earlier has indicated a media flow priority sharing to the PCF
by setting the \"prioSharingInd\" attribute to \"ENABLED\", the AF may
include the Priority-Sharing-Indicator AVP set to \"DISABLED\" within a
media component of the \"medComponents\" attribute to indicate to the
PCF that the related media flow shall not be part of the mechanism for
sharing the Allocation and Retention Priority with other media flows any
longer.

If this media flow was in priority sharing with other media flows the
PCF should readjust the Allocation and Retention Priority for the
remaining services sharing priority as described in
3GPP TS 29.512 \[8\], subclause 4.2.6.2.9 and handle the media flow
excluded from priority sharing according to normal PCC/QoS rule
provisioning procedures described in 3GPP TS 29.512 \[8\],
subclause 4.2.6.2.

If the AF earlier has indicated a media flow priority sharing to the PCF
by setting the \"prioSharingInd\" attribute to \"ENABLED\" for media
flows and the AF indicates to remove one or more of the media flows in
priority sharing with other media flows, the PCF should readjust the
Allocation and Retention Priority for the remaining services sharing
priority as described in 3GPP TS 29.512 \[8\], subclause 4.2.6.2.9 and
handle the media flow removed according to normal PCC/QoS rule
provisioning procedures described in 3GPP TS 29.212 \[8\],
subclause 4.2.6.2.

#### 4.2.3.22 Modification of Subscription to Out of Credit notification

This procedure is used by the AF if the \"IMS\_SBI\" feature is
supported to modify in the PCF the subscription to notification about
credit unavailability for the Service Data Flows within the AF
application session context.

The AF shall use the HTTP PATCH method to update the \"Events
Subscription\" sub-resource together with the modifications to the
\"Individual Application Session Context\" resource.

The AF shall include in the HTTP PATCH request message described in
subclause 4.2.3.2, in the \"ascReqData\" attribute, the updated values
of the \"EventsSubscReqDataRm\" data type, which either include in the
\"events\" attribute a new element with the \"event\" attribute set to
the value \"OUT\_OF\_CREDIT\" or remove from the \"events\" attribute
the existing element with the \"event\" attribute set to the value
\"OUT\_OF\_CREDIT\".

As a result of this action, the PCF shall set the appropriate
subscription to out of credit notification for the corresponding PCC
Rule(s) as described in 3GPP TS 29.512 \[8\].

The PCF shall reply to the AF with an HTTP response message as described
in subclause 4.2.3.2.

#### 4.2.3.23 Modification of Subscription to Service Data Flow QoS Monitoring Information

This procedure is used by AF to modify the PCF subscription for
notification about packet delay between UPF and UE, when the
\"QoSMonitoring\" feature is supported.

The AF shall use the HTTP PATCH method to update the \"Events
Subscription\" sub-resource together with the modifications to the
\"Individual Application Session Context\" resource.

The AF shall include in the HTTP PATCH request message described in
subclause 4.2.3.2, in the \"ascReqData\" attribute, the updated values
of the \"evSubsc\" attribute of \"EventsSubscReqDataRm\" data type, as
follows:

\- to create a subscription to QoS monitoring information:

a\) shall include the \"events\" array with an array that contains a new
entry with the \"event\" attribute set to \"QOS\_MONITORING\", and
notification related information as described in subclause 4.2.2.23;

b\) when the \"notifMethod\" of the new entry is \"EVENT\_DETECTION\",
shall include a \"qosMon\" attribute with the QoS monitoring information
as described in subclause 4.2.2.23.

c\) shall include the new requested QoS monitoring parameter(s) to be
measured (i.e. DL, UL and/or round trip packet delay) within the
\"reqQosMonParams\" attribute; and

d\) may include the notification correlation identifier assigned by the
AF within the \"notifCorreId\" attribute;

\- to remove a subscription to QoS monitoring information:

a\) shall include the \"events\" array containing an array that shall
omit the corresponding entry with the \"event\" attribute value
\"QOS\_MONITORING\"; and

b\) when the \"notifMethod\" of the removed entry is
\"EVENT\_DETECTION\", it shall contain the \"qosMon\" attribute set to
null.

As result of this action, the PCF shall set the appropriate subscription
to QoS monitoring information for the corresponding active PCC rule(s)
as described in 3GPP TS 29.512 \[8\].

The PCF shall reply to the AF as described in subclause 4.2.3.2.

#### 4.2.3.24 Update of TSCAI Input Information and TSC QoS related data

is not available at the PCF the PCF shall defer sending the response to
the AF and shall immediately configure the SMF to provide such
information, as specified in 3GPP TS 29.512 \[8\];

b\) otherwise, the PCF shall send to the AF a \"204 No Content\".

Afterwards, the PCF shall free the network resources allocated for the
Service Data Flow(s) corresponding to the deleted AF application session
context information. In order to do that, the PCF shall initiate the
request for the removal of any related PCC rules from the SMF, if not
previously done, following the corresponding procedures specified in
3GPP TS 29.512 \[8\].

If the HTTP POST request from the AF is rejected, the PCF shall indicate
in the response to HTTP POST request the cause for the rejection as
specified in subclause 5.7.

#### 4.2.4.3 Reporting usage for sponsored data connectivity

When \"SponsoredConnectivity\" is supported, and the AF indicated to
enable sponsored data connectivity and the AF provided usage thresholds
for such sponsor to the PCF, the PCF shall report accumulated usage to
the AF using the response of the Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization\_Delete
service operation.

This procedure is initiated when:

\- the \"Individual Application Session Context\" is deleted by the AF;
or

\- the PCF requests the deletion of the \"Individual Application Session
Context\" to the AF, as described in subclause 4.2.5.3, due to PDU
session termination, the termination of all the service data flows of
the AF session or the home operator policy disallowing the UE accessing
the sponsored data connectivity in the roaming case.

To report the accumulated usage, the PCF shall immediately configure the
SMF to retrieve the accumulated usage as specified in
3GPP TS 29.512 \[8\]. When the PCF receives the usage information from
the SMF, the PCF shall notify the AF by including the

3GPP TS 23.501 \[2\], 3GPP TS 23.502 \[3\] and 3GPP TS 23.503 \[4\].

Figure 4.2.5.3-1 illustrates the notification about application session
context termination.

Figure 4.2.5.3-1: Notification about application session context
termination

When the PCF determines that the AF application session context is no
longer valid, the PCF shall invoke the Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization\_Notify
service operation by sending the HTTP POST request (as shown in
figure 4.2.5.3-1, step 1) using the notification URI received in the
\"Individual Application Session Context\" context creation, as
specified in subclause 4.2.2 and subclause 4.2.6.3, and appending the
\"terminate\" segment path at the end of the URI, to trigger the AF to
request the application session context termination (see
subclause 4.2.4.2). The PCF shall provide in the body of the HTTP POST
request the \"TerminationInfo\" data type including:

\- the Individual Application Session Context resource identifier
related to the termination notification in the \"resUri\" attribute; and

\- the application session context termination cause in the
\"termCause\" attribute of the \"TerminationCause\" data type,
indicating:

i\) \"PDU\_SESSION\_TERMINATION\" when the PCF received from the SMF the
indication of SM Policy Context termination without a specific PDU
session release cause value;

ii\) \"ALL\_SDF\_DEACTIVATION\" when the PCF received from the SMF the
indication that all the SDFs of the Individual Application Session
Context resource are deactivated because other reasons than
\"PS\_TO\_CS\_HAN\";

iii\) \"PS\_TO\_CS\_HO\" if the \"IMS\_SBI\" feature is supported and
the PCF received from the SMF:

a\) the PDU session release cause value \"PS\_TO\_CS\_HO\"; or

b\) the failure code value \"PS\_TO\_CS\_HAN\" for all the SDFs of the
Individual Application Session Context resource.

Upon the reception of the HTTP POST request from the PCF requesting the
application session context termination, the AF shall acknowledge that
request by sending an HTTP response message with the corresponding
status code.

If the HTTP POST request from the PCF is accepted, the AF shall
acknowledge the receipt of the application session context termination
request with a \"204 No Content\" response to HTTP POST request (as
shown in figure 4.2.5.3-1, step 2) and shall invoke the
Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization\_Delete service operation to the PCF as
described in subclause 4.2.4.

If the HTTP POST request from the PCF is not accepted, the AF shall
indicate in the response to HTTP POST request the cause for the
rejection.

If the feature \"ES3XX\" is supported, and the AF determines the
received HTTP POST request needs to be redirected, the AF shall send an
HTTP redirect response as specified in subclause 6.10.9 of
3GPP TS 29.500 \[5\].

#### 4.2.5.16 Notification about 5GS Bridge Information, no Individual Application Session Context exists

If the \"TimeSensitiveNetworking\" feature is supported and if the PCF
becomes aware that 5GS Bridge information for a TSN network is
available, but there is no \"Individual Application Session Context\"
resource bound to the SM Policy Association updated with 5GS Bridge
related information, the PCF shall inform the TSN AF about the detection
of a 5GS Bridge Information in the context of a PDU session by sending a
notification request to the request URI locally configured in the PCF
for this TSN network.

NOTE: PCF configuration of TSN AF URI needs to ensure that the
notification is addressed to a TSN AF that belongs to the same TSN
network the UPF/NW-TT connectes to. How it is achieved is implementation
specific. It can be based e.g. on dedicated DNN/S-NSSAI combinations or
on the received Bridge information.

Figure 4.2.5.16-1 illustrates the notification about ethernet port
detection when there is no Individual Application Session Context bound
to the SM Policy Association.

Figure 4.2.5.16-1: Notification about 5GS Bridge Information, no AF
session context exists

When the PCF determines that the AF application session context does not
exist for the SM Policy Association that detected new TSN port
information, the PCF shall invoke the Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization\_Notify
service operation by sending the HTTP POST request (as shown in
figure 4.2.5.16-1, step 1) using the notification URI locally configured
in the PCF for this TSN network, and appending the \"new-bridge\"
segment path at the end of the URI, to trigger the TSN AF to request the
creation of an Invidual Application Session Context resource to handle
the 5GS Bridge detected in the context of a PDU session, configuring TSN
ports and bridge port management information, and providing the
corresponding TSCAI input containers and TSC traffic QoS related data
(see subclauses 4.2.2.2, 4.2.2.24, 4.2.2.25 and 4.2.2.31).

The PCF shall provide in the body of the HTTP POST request the
\"PduSessionTsnBridge\" data type including TSN Bridge information as
follows:

\- the \"tsnBridgeInfo\" attribute as received from the SMF;

\- the \"tsnBridgeManCont\" attribute as received from the SMF, if
available; and

\- the \"tsnPortManContDstt\" attribute and/or \"tsnPortManContNwtts\"
attribute as received from the SMF, if available.

Upon the reception of the HTTP POST request from the PCF, the AF shall
acknowledge that request.

With the received information, the TSN AF shall immediately trigger the
creation of an Individual Application Session Context resource to handle
in this association the configuration of the new 5GS Bridge in the
context of this PDU session, as described in subclauses 4.2.2.2,
4.2.2.24, 4.2.2.25 and 4.2.2.31.

The TSN AF may use the received TSN bridge information and/or the
received DS-TT port management information container and/or NW-TT port
management information containers and the local configuration to
construct the DS-TT port and or NW-TT port management information
required to interwork with the TSN network.

#### 4.2.5.17 Notification about Reallocation of Credit

If the \"IMS\_SBI\" and the \"ReallocationOfCredit\" features are
supported and if the PCF becomes aware that there is credit reallocated
for one or more SDFs after a former out of credit indication, the PCF
shall inform the AF accordingly if the AF has previously subscribed to
the \"REALLOCATION\_OF\_CREDIT\" event as described in
subclauses 4.2.2.34 and 4.2.3.32.

The PCF shall notify the AF by including the \"EventsNotification\" data
type in the body of the HTTP POST request as described in
subclause 4.2.5.2.

The PCF shall include in the \"evNotifs\" attribute an entry with:

\- the \"event\" attribute set to the value
\"REALLOCATION\_OF\_CREDIT\"; and

\- the SDFs that are impacted as consequence of the reallocation of
credit condition encoded in the \"flows\" attribute.

Upon the reception of the HTTP POST request from the PCF, the AF shall
acknowledge that request by sending an HTTP response message as
described in subclause 4.2.5.2.

### 4.2.6 Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization\_Subscribe service operation

#### 4.2.6.1 General

The Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization\_Subscribe service operation enables NF
service consumers handling of subscription to events for the existing
application session context. Subscription to events shall be created:

\- within the application session context establishment procedure by
invoking the Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization\_Create service operation, as
described in subclause 4.2.2; or

\- within the application session context modification procedure by
invoking the Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization\_Update service operation, as
described in subclause 4.2.3; or

\- by invoking the Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization\_Subscribe service
operation for the existing application session context, as described in
subclause 4.2.6.2.

The following procedures using the Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization\_Subscribe
service operation is supported:

\- Handling of subscription to events for the existing application
session context.

\- Initial subscription to events without provisioning of service
information.

\- Subscription to usage monitoring of sponsored data connectivity.

\- Request of access network information.

\- Subscription to notification of signalling path status.

\- Subscription to Service Data Flow QoS Monitoring Information.

#### 4.2.6.2 Handling of subscription to events for the existing application session context

This procedure is used to create a subscription to events for the
existing AF application session context bound to the corresponding PDU
session or to modify an existing subscription, as defined in
3GPP TS 23.501 \[2\], 3GPP TS 23.502 \[3\] and 3GPP TS 23.503 \[4\].

Figure 4.2.6.2-1 illustrates the creation of events subscription
information using HTTP PUT method.

Figure 4.2.6.2-1: Creation of events subscription information using HTTP
PUT

Figure 4.2.6.2-2 illustrates the modification of events subscription
information using HTTP PUT method.

Figure 4.2.6.2-2: Modification of events subscription information using
HTTP PUT

When the AF decides to create a subscription to one or more events for
the existing application session context or to modify an existing
subscription previously created by itself at the PCF, the AF shall
invoke the Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization\_Subscribe service operation by
sending the HTTP PUT request to the resource URI representing the
\"Events Subscription\" sub-resource in the PCF, as shown in
figure 4.2.6.2-1, step 1 and figure 4.2.6.2-2, step 1. The AF shall
provide in the \"EventsSubscReqData\" data type of the body of the HTTP
PUT request:

\- the \"events\" attribute with the list of events to be subscribed;
and

\- the \"notifUri\" attribute that includes the Notification URI to
indicate to the PCF where to send the notification of the subscribed
events.

NOTE 1: The \"notifUri\" attribute within the EventsSubscReqData data
structure can be modified to request that subsequent notifications are
sent to a new NF service consumer.

Upon the reception of the HTTP PUT request from the AF, the PCF shall
decide whether the received HTTP PUT request is accepted.

If the HTTP PUT request from the AF is rejected, the PCF shall indicate
in the HTTP response the cause for the rejection as specified in
subclause 5.7.

If the feature \"ES3XX\" is supported, and the PCF determines the
received HTTP PUT request needs to be redirected, the PCF shall send an
HTTP redirect response as specified in subclause 6.10.9 of
3GPP TS 29.500 \[5\].

If the PCF accepted the HTTP PUT request to create a subscription to
events, the PCF shall create the \"Events Subscription\" sub-resource
and shall send the HTTP response message to the AF as shown in
figure 4.2.6.2-1, step 2. The PCF shall include in the \"201 Created\"
response:

\- a Location header field that shall contain the URI of the created
\"Events Subscription\" sub-resource i.e.
\"{apiRoot}/npcf-policyauthorization/v1/app-sessions/{appSessionId}/events-subscription\";
and

\- a response body with the \"EventsSubscPutData\" data type, that
contains the attributes of the \"EventsSubscReqData\" data type,
representing the created \"Events Subscription\" sub-resource.

If the PCF determines that one or more of the subscribed events are
already met in the PCF, the PCF may also include the attributes of the
\"EventsNotification\" data type within the \"EventsSubscPutData\" data
type to notify about the already met events in the PCF.

If the PCF accepted the HTTP PUT request to modify the events
subscription, the PCF shall modify the \"Events Subscription\"
sub-resource and shall send to the AF:

\- the HTTP \"204 No Content\" response (as shown in figure 4.2.6.2-2,
step 2a); or

\- the HTTP \"200 OK\" response (as shown in figure 4.2.6.2-2, step 2b)
including in the \"EventsSubscPutData\" data type the updated
representation of the \"Events Subscription\" sub-resource encoded
within the attributes of the \"EventsSubscReqData\" data type and, if
one or more of the updated subscribed events are already met in the PCF,
the notification of these events by including the attributes of the
\"EventsNotification\" data type.

The PCF shall include in the \"evsNotif\" attribute:

\- if the AF subscribed to the \"PLMN\_CHG\" event in the HTTP PUT
request, the \"event\" attribute set to \"PLMN\_CHG\" and the \"plmnId\"
attribute including the PLMN identifier and, if available, the NID if
the PCF has previously requested to be updated with this information in
the SMF; and

\- if the AF subscribed to the \"ACCESS\_TYPE\_CHANGE\" event in the
HTTP PUT request, the \"event\" attribute set to
\"ACCESS\_TYPE\_CHANGE\" and:

i\. the \"accessType\" attribute including the access type, and the
\"ratType\" attribute including the RAT type when applicable for the
notified access type; and

ii\. if the \"ATSSS\" feature is supported, the \"addAccessInfo\"
attribute with the additional access type information if available,
where the access type is encoded in the \"accessType\" attribute, and
the RAT type is encoded in the \"ratType\" attribute when applicable for
the notified access type; and

NOTE 2: For a MA PDU session, if the \"ATSSS\" feature is not supported
by the AF the PCF includes the \"accessType\" attribute and the
\"ratType\" attribute with a currently active combination of access type
and RAT type (when applicable for the notified access type). When both
3GPP and non-3GPP accesses are available, the PCF includes the
information corresponding to the 3GPP access.

iii\. the \"anGwAddr\" attribute including access network gateway
address when available,

if the PCF has previously requested to be updated with this information
in the SMF.

Based on the received subscription information from the AF, the PCF may
create a subscription to event notifications or may modify the existing
subscription to event notifications, for a related PDU session from the
SMF, as described in 3GPP TS 29.512 \[8\].

#### 4.2.6.3 Initial subscription to events without provisioning of service information

The AF may subscribe with the PCF to events notification without
providing service information.

NOTE 1: This service operation is intended to create a resource that
enables to handle subscription to events without provisioning service
information. For the scenarios where it is known the AF, after creating
a subscription without service information, could require an application
session context with the PCF with required service information, the AF
needs to create an Individual Application Session context as described
in subclause 4.2.2.2.

Figure 4.2.6.3-1 illustrates the initial subscription to events without
provisioning of service information.

Figure 4.2.6.3-1: Initial Subscription to events without provisioning of
service information

When an AF establishes an application session context with the PCF to
subscribe to events and does not require PCC control for the related
media, the AF shall invoke the Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization\_Subscribe
service operation by sending the HTTP POST request to the resource URI
representing the \"Application Sessions\" collection resource of the
PCF, as shown in figure 4.2.6.3-1, step 1.

The AF shall include in the \"ascReqData\" attribute of the
\"AppSessionContext\" data type in the payload body of the HTTP POST
request:

\- either the \"ueMac\" attribute containing the UE MAC address, or the
\"ueIpv4\" attribute or \"ueIpv6\" attribute containing the UE IPv4 or
the IPv6 address;

\- the \"notifUri\" attribute containing the URI where the PCF shall
request to the AF the deletion of the \"Individual Application Session
Context\" resource\"; and

\- the \"evSubsc\" attribute of \"EventsSubscReqData\" data type to
request the notification of certain user plane events. The AF shall
include:

a\. the events to subscribe to in the \"events\" attribute; and

b\. the notification URI where to address the notification of the met
events within the \"notifUri\" attribute.

The AF may provide in the \"AppSessionContext\" data type the DNN in the
\"dnn\" attribute, SUPI in the \"supi\" attribute or other information
if available.

If the PCF cannot successfully fulfil the received HTTP POST request due
to the internal PCF error or due to the error in the HTTP POST request,
the PCF shall send the HTTP error response as specified in
subclause 5.7.

Otherwise, when the PCF receives the HTTP POST request from the AF, the
PCF shall apply session binding as described in 3GPP TS 29.513 \[7\].
The PCF identifies the PDU session for which the HTTP POST request
applies as described in subclause 4.2.2.2.

The information required for session binding (UE MAC address, or UE Ipv4
or IPv6 address, DNN, SUPI and other available information, such as
S-NSSAI and/or IPv4 address domain identifier) is provisioned in the
\"Individual Application Session Context\" resource. The events
subscription is provisioned in the \"Events Subscription\" sub-resource.

Based on the received subscription information from the AF, the PCF may
create a subscription to event notifications for a related PDU session
from the SMF, as described in 3GPP TS 29.512 \[8\].

If the PCF created the \"Events Subscription\" sub-resource within the
\"Individual Application Session Context\" resource, the PCF shall send
to the AF a \"201 Created\" response to the HTTP POST request, as shown
in figure 4.2.6.3-1, step 2. The PCF shall include in the \"201
Created\" response:

\- a Location header field; and

\- an \"AppSessionContext\" data type in the payload body.

The Location header field shall contain the URI of the created events
subscription sub-resource i.e.
\"{apiRoot}/npcf-policyauthorization/v1/app-sessions/{appSessionId}/events-subscription\".

The \"AppSessionContext\" data type payload body shall contain the
representation of the created \"Individual Application Session Context\"
resource and \"Events Subscription\" sub-resource.

The PCF shall include in the \"evsNotif\" attribute:

\- if the AF subscribed to the event \"PLMN\_CHG\" in the HTTP POST
request, the \"event\" attribute set to \"PLMN\_CHG\" and the \"plmnId\"
attribute including the PLMN identifier and, if available, the NID if
the PCF has previously requested to be updated with this information in
the SMF;

\- if the AF subscribed to the event \"ACCESS\_TYPE\_CHANGE\" in the
HTTP POST request, the \"event\" attribute set to
\"ACCESS\_TYPE\_CHANGE\" and:

i\. the \"accessType\" attribute including the access type, and the
\"ratType\" attribute including the RAT type when applicable for the
notified access type; and

ii\. if the \"ATSSS\" feature is supported, the \"addAccessInfo\"
attribute with the additional access type information if available,
where the access type is encoded in the \"accessType\" attribute, and
the RAT type is encoded in the \"ratType\" attribute when applicable for
the notified access type; and

NOTE 2: For a MA PDU session, if the \"ATSSS\" feature is not supported
by the AF the PCF includes the \"accessType\" attribute and the
\"ratType\" attribute with a currently active combination of access type
and RAT type (if applicable for the notified access type). When both
3GPP and non-3GPP accesses are available, the PCF includes the
information corresponding to the 3GPP access.

iii\. the \"anGwAddress\" attribute including access network gateway
address when available,

if the PCF has previously requested to be updated with this information
in the SMF; and

\- if the \"IMS\_SBI\" feature is supported and if the AF subscribed to
the event \"CHARGING\_CORRELATION\" in the HTTP POST request, the
\"event\" attribute set to \"CHARGING\_CORRELATION\" and may include the
\"anChargIds\" attribute containing the access network charging
identifier(s) and the \"anChargAddr\" attribute containing the access
network charging address.

NOTE 3: Due to the resource structure, as result of the
Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization\_Subscribe service operation using POST
methods, the PCF creates an Individual Application Session context
resource which can only be deleted via Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization\_Delete
service operation.

#### 4.2.6.4 Subscription to usage monitoring of sponsored data connectivity

This procedure is used by an AF to subscribe with the PCF to usage
monitoring of sponsored data connectivity or to provide updated usage
thresholds for the existing application session context, when the
\"Sponsored Connectivity\" feature is supported.

The AF shall include in the HTTP PUT request message described in
subclause 4.2.6.2 the \"EventsSubscReqData\" data type, that shall
contain:

\- the \"events\" attribute with a new entry of the
\"AfEventSubscription\" data type with the \"event\" attribute set to
\"USAGE\_REPORT\"; and

\- the \"usgThres\" attribute with the usage thresholds to apply.

The PCF shall reply to the AF as described in subclause 4.2.6.2.

#### 4.2.6.5 Void

#### 4.2.6.6 Request of access network information

This procedure is used by an AF to request the PCF to report the access
network information (i.e. user location and/or user timezone
information) without providing service information when the \"NetLoc\"
feature is supported.

The AF can request access network information without providing service
information:

\- at initial subscription to events, using the HTTP POST request
message as described in subclause 4.2.6.3; and

\- at modification of the subscription to events, using the HTTP PUT
request message as described in subclause 4.2.6.2.

The AF shall include in the HTTP request message:

\- an entry of the \"AfEventSubscription\" data type in the \"events\"
attribute with:

a\) the \"event\" attribute set to the value \"ANI\_REPORT\"; and

b\) the \"notifMethod\" attribute set to the value \"ONE\_TIME\"; and

\- the \"reqAnis\" attribute, with the required access network
information, i.e. user location and/or user time zone information).

When the PCF determines that the access network does not support the
access network information reporting because the SMF does not support
the NetLoc feature, the PCF shall respond to the AF including in the
\"EventsNotification\" data type the \"noNetLocSupp\" attribute set to
\"ANR\_NOT\_SUPPORTED\" value. Otherwise, the PCF shall immediately
configure the SMF to provide such access information, as specified in
3GPP TS 29.512 \[8\].

The PCF shall reply to the AF with the HTTP POST response as described
in subclause 4.2.6.3 and with the HTTP PUT response as described in
subclause 4.2.6.2.

#### 4.2.6.7 Subscription to notification of signalling path status

When the feature \"IMS\_SBI\" is supported, this procedure is used by an
AF to subscribe to notifications of the status of the AF signalling
transmission path.

The AF shall create a new \"Individual Application Session Context\"
resource with the PCF for the AF signalling using the
Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization\_Create service operation.

The AF shall provide:

\- the IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) of the UE in the \"ueIpv4\" or
\"ueIpv6\" attribute;

\- within the \"evSubsc\" attribute, the \"event\" attribute set to
\"FAILED\_RESOURCES\_ALLOCATION\"; and

\- a media component within the \"medComponents\" attribute including:

\- the \"medCompN\" attribute set to \"0\"; and

\- a single media subcomponent within the \"medSubComps\" attribute
with:

\- the \"flowUsage\" attribute set to the value \"AF\_SIGNALLING\"; and

\- if the procedures for AF provisioning of AF signalling flow
information do not apply, the \"fNum\" attribute set to \"0\".

When the \"fNum\" attribute is set to \"0\", the rest of attributes
within the related media component and media subcomponent shall not be
used.

The PCF shall perform session binding as described in
3GPP TS 29.513 \[7\] and shall reply to the AF as described in
subclause 4.2.6.3.

PCC rules related to AF signalling IP flows should be provisioned to SMF
using the corresponding procedures specified at 3GPP TS 29.512 \[8\] at
an earlier stage (e.g. typically at the establishment of the QoS flow
dedicated for AF signalling IP flows). The PCF may install the
corresponding dynamic PCC rules for the AF signalling IP flows if none
has been installed before.

NOTE 1: Well-known ports (e.g. 3GPP TS 24.229 \[32\] for SIP) or
wildcard ports can be used by PCF to derive the dynamic PCC for the AF
signalling IP flows.

If the \"Individual Application Session Context\" resource is only used
for subscription to notification of AF signalling path status, the AF
may cancel the subscription to notifications of the status of the AF
signalling transmission path removing the resource as described in
subclause 4.2.4.2.

NOTE 2: The \"Individual Application Session Context\" resource created
for the AF signalling can also be used when the AF requests
notifications of access type change, and/or when the AF provisions AF
Signalling Flow Information.

#### 4.2.6.8 Subscription to Service Data Flow QoS Monitoring Information

This procedure is used by AF to subscribe and/or modify the PCF
subscription for notification about packet delay between UPF and UE,
when the \"QoSMonitoring\" feature is supported.

The AF shall include in the HTTP PUT request message described in
subclause 4.2.6.2 the \"EventsSubscReqData\" data type, that shall
contain:

\- to create a subscription to QoS monitoring information:

a\) shall include the \"events\" array with an array that contains a new
entry with the \"event\" attribute set to \"QOS\_MONITORING\", and
notification related information as described in subclause 4.2.2.23;

b\) when the \"notifMethod\" of the new entry is \"EVENT\_DETECTION\",
shall include a \"qosMon\" attribute with the QoS monitoring information
as described in subclause 4.2.2.23;

c\) shall include the new requested QoS monitoring parameter(s) to be
measured (i.e. DL, UL and/or round trip packet delay) within the
\"reqQosMonParams\" attribute; and

d\) may include the notification correlation identifier assigned by the
AF within the \"notifCorreId\" attribute.

\- to remove a subscription to QoS monitoring information:

a\) shall include the \"events\" array containing an array that shall
omit the corresponding entry with the \"event\" attribute value
\"QOS\_MONITORING\"; and

b\) when the \"notifMethod\" of the removed entry is
\"EVENT\_DETECTION\", it shall omit the \"qosMon\".

The AF shall include other events related information that shall remain
unchanged.

As result of this action, the PCF shall set the appropriate subscription
to QoS monitoring information for the corresponding active PCC rule(s)
as described in 3GPP TS 29.512 \[8\].

The PCF shall reply to the AF as described in subclause 4.2.6.2.

### 4.2.7 Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization\_Unsubscribe service operation

#### 4.2.7.1 General

The Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization\_Unsubscribe service operation enables NF
service consumers to remove subscription to all subscribed events for
the existing application session context. Subscription to events shall
be removed:

\- by invoking the Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization\_Unsubscribe service
operation for the existing application session context, as described in
subclause 4.2.7.2; or

\- within the application session context modification procedure by
invoking the Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization\_Update service operation, as
described in subclause 4.2.3; or

\- within the application session context termination procedure by
invoking the Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization\_Delete service operation, as
described in subclause 4.2.4.

The following procedure using the Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization\_Unsubscribe
service operation is supported:

\- Unsubscription to events.

#### 4.2.7.2 Unsubscription to events

This procedure is used to unsubscribe to all subscribed events for the
existing AF application session context, as defined in
3GPP TS 23.501 \[2\], 3GPP TS 23.502 \[3\] and 3GPP TS 23.503 \[4\].

Figure 4.2.7.2-1 illustrates the unsubscription to events using the HTTP
DELETE method.

Figure 4.2.7.2-1: Removal of events subscription information using HTTP
DELETE

When the AF decides to unsubscribe to all subscribed events for the
existing application session context, the AF shall invoke the
Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization\_Unsubscribe service operation by sending the
HTTP DELETE request message to the resource URI representing the
\"Events Subscription\" sub-resource in the PCF, as shown in
figure 4.2.7.2-1, step 1.

Upon the reception of the HTTP DELETE request message from the AF, the
PCF shall decide whether the received HTTP request message is accepted.

If the HTTP DELETE request message from the AF is accepted, the PCF
shall delete \"Events Subscription\" sub-resource and shall send to the
AF a HTTP \"204 No Content\" response message. The PCF may delete the
existing subscription to event notifications for the related PDU session
from the SMF as described in 3GPP TS 29.512 \[8\].

If the HTTP DELETE request message from the AF is rejected, the PCF
shall indicate in the HTTP response message the cause for the rejection
as specified in subclause 5.7.

### 5.5.4 Detected 5GS Bridge for a PDU session

#### 5.5.4.1 Description

The Detected 5GS Bridge for a PDU session operation is used by the PCF
to notifiy the NF service consumer about the detection of 5GS Bridge
information in the context of a PDU session and to trigger in the TSN AF
the creation of a new Individual Application Session Context to
associate it with the detected 5GS Bridge for the PDU session.

The PCF shall use the locally configured notification URI of the TSN AF
as request URI of the notification request. The \"callback\" definition
in the OpenAPI specification is associated to the
\"ApplicationSessions\" resource.

#### 5.5.4.2 Target URI

The Callback URI **\"{notifUri}/new-bridge\"** shall be used with the

All IP flows within a \"MediaSubComponent\" data type are permanently
disabled by supplying \"FlowStatus\" data type with a deletion
indication.

Bandwidth information and the \"fStatus\" attribute provided within the
MediaComponent applies to all those IP flows within the media component,
for which no corresponding information is being provided within the
\"medSubComps\" attribute. As defined in 3GPP TS 29.513 \[7\], the
bandwidth information within the media component level \"marBwUl\" and
\"marBwDl\" attributes applies separately to each media subcomponent
except for media subcomponents with a \"flowUsage\" attribute with the
value \"RTCP\". The mapping of bandwidth information for RTCP media
subcomponent is defined in 3GPP TS 29.513 \[7\] subclause 7.3.3.

5.9 Security
------------

As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.501 \[25\] and 3GPP TS 29.500 \[5\], the
access to the Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization API, based on local
configuration, may be authorized by means of the OAuth2 protocol (see
IETF RFC 6749 \[26\]), using the \"Client Credentials\" authorization
grant, where the NRF (see 3GPP TS 29.510 \[27\]) plays the role of the
authorization server.

If OAuth2 authorization is used, an NF Service Consumer, prior to
consuming services offered by the Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization API, shall
obtain a \"token\" from the authorization server, by invoking the Access
Token Request service, as described in 3GPP TS 29.510 \[27\],
subclause 5.4.2.2.

NOTE: When multiple NRFs are deployed in a network, the NRF used as
authorization server is the same NRF that the NF Service Consumer used
for discovering the Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization service.

The Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization API defines a single scope
\"npcf-policyauthorization\" for OAuth2 authorization (as specified in
3GPP TS 33.501 \[25\]) for the entire API, and it does not define any
additional scopes at resource or operation level.

######## Annex A (normative): OpenAPI specification

A.1 General
===========

The present Annex contains an OpenAPI \[11\] specification of HTTP
messages and content bodies used by the Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization API.

This Annex shall take precedence when being discrepant to other parts of
the specification with respect to the encoding of information elements
and methods within the API.

NOTE: The semantics and procedures, as well as conditions, e.g. for the
applicability and allowed combinations of attributes or values, not
expressed in the OpenAPI definitions but defined in other parts of the
specification also apply.

Informative copies of the OpenAPI specification file contained in this
3GPP Technical Specification are available on a Git-based repository
that uses the GitLab software version control system (see clause 5B of
the 3GPP TR 21.900 \[28\] and subclause 5.3.1 of the
3GPP TS 29.501 \[6\] for further information).

######## Annex B (normative): IMS Related P-CSCF Procedures over N5

B.1 Provision of Service Information at P-CSCF
==============================================

When the \"IMS\_SBI\" feature is supported, the P-CSCF shall send
service information to the PCF upon every SIP message that includes an
SDP answer payload for the purpose of authorizing the IP flows and the
QoS resources required for a negotiated IMS session, unless the SDP
payload only relates to a circuit-switched bearer (i.e. \"c=\" line set
to \"PSTN\" and an \"m=\" line set to \"PSTN\", refer to
3GPP TS 24.292 \[29\]). The service information shall be derived both
from the SDP offer and the SDP answer. This ensures that the PCF
receives proper information to perform media authorization for all
possible IMS session set-up scenarios, and that the PCF is also capable
of handling session modifications. The P-CSCF may include
\"servInfStatus\" attribute set to \"FINAL\".

Additionally, the P-CSCF may send service information to the PCF when
receiving a SIP message that includes an SDP offer payload for the
purpose of performing an early bandwidth authorization check, or for
enabling pre-authorization for a UE terminated IMS session establishment
or modification with UE initiated resource reservation, or for the
retrieval of network provided access network information (see
subclause B.8.2).

The P-CSCF shall send service information to the PCF when receiving a
SIP message that includes an SDP offer payload when the IMS session is
an MPS session that requires priority treatment. For a UE terminated
session the P-CSCF may send the service information derived from the SDP
offer when the SDP offer either does not include any preconditions
information or includes preconditions information indicating that the
local preconditions (i.e. the preconditions related to the remote peer)
are already met. In this case, the P-CSCF shall derive the service
information only from the SDP offer and shall include \"servInfStatus\"
attribute set to \"PRELIMINARY\".

NOTE 1: For a UE terminated session setup, when the SDP offer either
does not include any preconditions information or includes preconditions
information indicating that the local preconditions (i.e. the
preconditions related to the remote peer) are already met, the
terminating UE can request a resource modification prior to sending the
SDP answer. Even if the IP address and port information in the session
information derived from the SDP offer can be insufficient for PCC rule
authorization, the policy to handle such UE initiated requests at the
PCF can take into account the fact that an IMS session establishment is
ongoing, for instance in deciding whether to authorize the request and
in selecting an appropriate charging key and a gating policy.

The P-CSCF shall derive the value of the \"fDescs\" attribute within the
service information from the SDP as follows:

\- An uplink entry in the \"fDescs\" attribute shall be formed as
follows: The destination address shall be taken from the SDP information
received by the P-CSCF in downlink direction, while the source IP
address may be formed from the address present in the SDP received by
the P-CSCF in uplink direction (taking into account only the 64 bit
prefix of the Ipv6 address) Source and destination ports shall be
derived according to rules provided in 3GPP TS 29.513 \[7\]
subclause 7.2.

EXAMPLE 1: Assuming UE A sends an SDP to UE B, the PCF of UE B uses the
address present in this SDP for the destination address of UE B's uplink
entry in the \"fDescs\" attribute, while the PCF of the UE A uses the 64
bit prefix of the same address for the source address of UE A's uplink
entry in the \"fDescs\" attribute. If the source address is not formed
from the 64 bit prefix, the source address shall be wildcarded.

\- A downlink entry in the \"fDescs\" attribute shall be formed as
follows: The destination address shall be taken from the SDP information
received by the P-CSCF in uplink direction, while the source IP address
may be formed (in order to reduce the possibilities of QoS flow misuse)
from the destination address in the SDP received by the P-CSCF in
downlink direction (taking into account only the 64 bit prefix of the
Ipv6 address) Source and destination ports shall be derived according to
rules provided in 3GPP TS 29.513 \[7\] subclause 7.2.

EXAMPLE 2: Assuming UE A sends an SDP to UE B, the PCF of UE A uses the
address present in this SDP for the destination address of UE A's
downlink entry in the \"fDescs\" attribute, while the PCF of UE B uses
the 64 bit prefix of the same address for the source address of UE B's
downlink entry in the \"fDescs\" attribute. If the source address is not
formed from the 64 bit prefix, the source address shall be wildcarded.

The P-CSCF shall derive the bandwidth information within the service
information, from the \"b=AS\" SDP parameter and \"a=bw-info\" SDP
parameter, if available. If \"a=bw-info\" is used for bandwidth
derivation, the P-CSCF shall use the SDP attribute line that contains
the bandwidth properties for the IP version used by the UE, as detailed
in 3GPP TS 29.513 \[7\] subclause 7.2. If the received \"a=bw-info\" SDP
attribute line(s) contain only bandwidth properties for an IP version
that is not used by the UE, the P-CSCF shall re-compute the bandwidth
properties for the used IP version and use that value for the bandwidth
derivation as defined in 3GPP TS 26.114 \[30\].

NOTE 2: If no IP version is included for any of the \"a=bw-info\" SDP
attribute lines related to a certain payload type and direction then
IPv6 is assumed for all bandwidth properties related to the same
direction and payload type, on all of the related \"a=bw-info\" SDP
attribute lines, see clause 19 of 3GPP TS 26.114 \[30\].

If \"a=bw-info\" is used for bandwidth derivation and it includes both
known and unknown bandwidth properties, the P-CSCF shall only consider
the known bandwidth properties to derive the bandwidth information and
ignore the unknown ones. If the\" a=bw-info\" line is received with an
unknown directionality, then the entire \"a=bw-info\" line shall be
ignored.

For the possibly associated RTCP IP flows, the P-CSCF shall use the SDP
\"b=RR\" and \"b=RS\" parameters, if present, as specified in
3GPP TS 29.513 \[7\] subclause 7.2. The \"b=AS\", \"b=RR\" and \"b=RS\"
parameters in the SDP contain all the overhead coming from the IP-layer
and the layers above, e.g. IP, UDP, RTP and RTCP payload, or IP, UDP and
RTCP.

For multiplexed RTP/RTCP flows (as negotiated using the \"a=rtcp-mux\"
SDP attribute defined in IETF RFC 5761 \[31\], a P-CSCF supporting
RTP/RTCP transport multiplexing shall derive the bandwidth information
within the service information as specified in 3GPP TS 29.513 \[7\]
subclause 7.2.

However, if service information is received containing the \"b=TIAS\"
SDP parameter that corresponds to an SDP answer payload, and if the
P-CSCF supports this parameter, the P-CSCF may derive the bandwidth from
this parameter rather than from the \"b=AS\" SDP parameter, as detailed
in 3GPP TS 29.513 \[7\] subclause 7.2.

When available, the P-CSCF shall also indicate to PCF, as a complement
to the Service Information, the IMS Communication Service Identifier
within the \"afAppId\" attribute. The originating P-CSCF shall take the
IMS Communication Service Identifier value from the SIP response. The
terminating P-CSCF shall take the IMS Communication Service Identifier
value from the SIP request. Otherwise, the P-CSCF may not be able to
provide an IMS Communication Service Identifier value to the PCF. The
format and specific headers where IMS communication service identifiers
are transported within SIP are defined in 3GPP TS 24.229 \[32\].

NOTE 3: In order to indicate the IMS Communication Service Identifier to
the PCF, the originating P-CSCF sets the \"afAppId\" attribute to the
ICSI contained in the topmost occurrence of the \"+g.3gpp.icsi-ref\"
header field parameter of the Feature-Caps header field(s) of 18x or 2xx
SIP response (Feature-Caps:
\*;+g.3gpp.icsi-ref="urn%Aurn-7%A3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mmtel") and the
terminating P-CSCF sets the \"afAppId\" attribute to the ICSI of the
P-Asserted-Service header information received in the SIP request (e.g.
P-Asserted-Service: urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mmtel). Since the
headers and the format of the ICSI can vary depending on the case, the
PCF has to be prepared to accept the complete ICSI information received
in different formats, as described in subclause 7.2A.8.2 in
3GPP TS 24.229 \[32\].

Additionally, if \"ResourceSharing\" feature is supported, the P-CSCF
may include the \"sharingKeyUl\" attribute and/or \"sharingKeyDl\"
attribute within a media component of the \"medComponents\" attribute in
order to indicate the PCF that resource sharing should apply for the
media components in the related direction with the same value for the
\"sharingKeyUl\" attribute and/or \"sharingKeyDl\" attribute.

Additionally, if \"PrioritySharing\" feature is supported, the P-CSCF
may provide the \"prioSharingInd\" attribute within a media component of
the \"medComponents\" attribute as described in subclause 4.2.2.21 and
4.2.3.21.

NOTE 4: The P-CSCF obtains this information from the Application Server
as described in 3GPP TS 23.228 \[33\], subclause 5.4.7.9.

NOTE 5: RTCP flows are not subject to resource sharing. This requirement
cannot be met for multiplexed RTP/RTCP flows as in this case there is no
mechanism in the current release to distinguish between RTP and RTCP
flows.

If the \"servUrn\" attribute does not include an emergency service URN,
i.e. a top-level service type of \"sos\" as specified in
IETF RFC 5031 \[34\] and possibly additional sub-service information on
the type of the emergency service and the PCF binds the IMS service
session to a PDU session established to an Emergency DNN, the PCF shall
return the application error UNAUTHORIZED\_NON\_EMERGENCY\_SESSION to
the P-CSCF. Upon receiving an application error
UNAUTHORIZED\_NON\_EMERGENCY\_SESSION the P-CSCF shall apply the
procedures defined in 3GPP TS 24.229 \[32\].

NOTE 6: The PCF determines whether a PDU session is established to an
Emergency DNN based on the information received over N7 and operator
configuration.

If the \"afReqData\" attribute is provided in the \"ascReqData\"
attribute indicating \"5GS-level UE Identities required\", the PCF shall
provide the available user information for the PDU session within the
\"ueIds\" attribute included in the \"ascRespData\" attribute, where
each entry shall contain either the \"supi\", and/or the \"gpsi\" and/or
the \"pei\" attributes.

The PCF may decide not to authorize requested service information. The
PCF will indicate it to the P-CSCF by rejecting the HTTP request with an
HTTP \"403 Forbidden\" response message including the \"cause\"
attribute set to \"REQUESTED\_SERVICE\_NOT\_AUTHORIZED\". Upon receiving
an HTTP \"403 Forbidden\" response message including the \"cause\"
attribute set to the value \"REQUESTED\_SERVICE\_NOT\_AUTHORIZED\" the
P-CSCF shall apply the procedures defined in 3GPP TS 24.229 \[32\].

B.2 Enabling of IP Flows
========================

B.2.1 General
-------------

Prior to the completion of the SIP session set-up, i.e. until the 2xx
response to the INVITE request is received, the P-CSCF may enable or
disable media IP flows depending on operator policy, thus allowing or
forbidding early media in forward and/or backward direction. The P-CSCF
may set the values of the \"fStatus\" attribute derived from the SDP
direction attributes as defined in 3GPP TS 29.513 \[7\] subclause 7.3.3
or set the values of the \"fStatus\" attributes considering the em-param
of the P-Early-Media header field according to subclause B.2.2 or
downgrade the values of the \"fStatus\" attribute derived from the SDP
direction attribute based on the configuration in the P-CSCF according
to subclause B.2.3. However for multiplexed RTP/RTCP flows (as
negotiated using the \"a=rtcp-mux\" SDP attribute defined in
IETF RFC 5761 \[31\]), a P-CSCF supporting RTP/RTCP transport
multiplexing shall set the \"fStatus\" attribute to \"ENABLED\" to
prevent that RTCP is blocked. If the P-CSCF chooses to modify the values
of the \"fStatus\" as received from the SDP direction attribute, the
P-CSCF shall store the last received SDP.

When a 2xx response is received, the P-CSCF shall enable all media IP
flows according to the direction attribute within the last received SDP,
as specified in 3GPP TS 29.513 \[7\] subclause 7.3.3. When a 2xx
response is received and the P-CSCF previously provided the values of
the \"fStatus\" attributes different from the value derived from the SDP
direction attribute in the session information, the P-CSCF shall provide
service information with values of the \"fStatus\" attributes
corresponding to the last received SDP.

NOTE: In most cases a 2xx response is a 200 (OK) response.

If the P-CSCF receives SDP answers after the completion of the SIP
session set-up, i.e. after the 2xx response to the INVITE request is
received, the P-CSCF shall provide the \"fStatus\" attribute, based on
the last received SDP answer. The \"fStatus\" attribute shall be derived
from the SDP according to 3GPP TS 29.513 \[7\] subclause 7.3.3.

B.2.2 Gate control procedures considering the P-Early-Media header field
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prior to the completion of the SIP session set-up, the P-CSCF may use
the em-param of the P-Early-Media header field defined in
IETF RFC 5009 \[35\] in order to enable or disable early media in
forward and/or backward direction. If the P-CSCF uses the em-param of
the P-Early-Media header field for the gate control of early media, the
P-CSCF shall perform the following procedures.

In the terminating P-CSCF, when a SIP message with the P-Early-Media
header field is received from the UE and the policies configured in the
P-CSCF indicate that the UE is authorized to send early media, then:

1\) the P-CSCF shall set the \"fStatus\" attribute to \"ENABLED\" if:

\- the received em-param(s) in the P-Early-Media header field includes
\"sendrecv\" and the last received SDP direction attribute from the UE
is \"sendrecv\" or no SDP direction attribute has been received; or

2\) the P-CSCF shall set the \"fStatus\" attribute to \"ENABLED-UPLINK\"
if:

\- the received em-param(s) in the P-Early-Media header field includes
\"sendrecv\" and the last received SDP direction attribute from the UE
is \"sendonly\"; or

\- the received em-param(s) in the P-Early-Media header field includes
\"sendonly\" and the last received SDP direction attribute from the UE
is \"sendrecv\" or \"sendonly\" or no SDP direction attribute has been
received; or

3\) the P-CSCF shall set the \"fStatus\" attribute to
\"ENABLED-DOWNLINK\" if:

\- the received em-param(s) in the P-Early-Media header field includes
\"sendrecv\" and the last received SDP direction attribute from the UE
is \"recvonly\"; or

\- the received em-param(s) in the P-Early-Media header field includes
\"recvonly\" and the last received SDP direction attribute from the UE
is \"sendrecv\" or \"recvonly\" or no SDP direction attribute has been
received; or

4\) the P-CSCF shall set the \"fStatus\" attribute to \"DISABLED\" if
either the received em-param(s) in the P-Early-Media header field or the
last received SDP direction attribute from the UE includes \"inactive\";
or

5\) the P-CSCF may set the \"fStatus\" attribute to \"DISABLED\" or
apply the rules defined in subclause B.2.2 if the received em-param(s)
in the P-Early-Media header field includes \"sendonly\" or \"recvonly\"
and the last received SDP direction attribute from the UE is
\"recvonly\" or \"sendonly\" respectively.

NOTE 1: If the UE is authorized to send early media, the P-CSCF will not
remove or modify the P-Early-Media header field according to
3GPP TS 24.229 \[32\].

When a SIP message with the P-Early-Media header field is received from
the functional entity within the trust domain, and if:

\- the P-Early-Media header field includes the \"gated\" parameter, then
the P-CSCF may decide not to perform the gate control of early media; or

\- the P-Early-Media header field does not include the \"gated\"
parameter, then the P-CSCF shall perform the following procedures:

1\) the P-CSCF shall set the \"fStatus\" attribute to \"ENABLED\" if:

\- the received em-param(s) in the P-Early-Media header field includes
\"sendrecv\" and the last received SDP direction attribute from the
functional entity is \"sendrecv\" or no SDP direction attribute has been
received; or

2\) the P-CSCF shall set the \"fStatus\" attribute to
\"ENABLED-DOWNLINK\" if:

\- the received em-param(s) in the P-Early-Media header field includes
\"sendrecv\" and the last received SDP direction attribute from the
functional entity is \"sendonly\"; or

\- the received em-param(s) in the P-Early-Media header field includes
\"sendonly\" and the last received SDP direction attribute from the
functional entity is \"sendrecv\" or \"sendonly\" or no SDP direction
parameter has been received; or

3\) the P-CSCF shall set the \"fStatus\" attribute to \"ENABLED-UPLINK\"
if:

\- the received em-param(s) in the P-Early-Media header field includes
\"sendrecv\" and the last received SDP direction attribute from the
functional entity is \"recvonly\"; or

\- the received em-param(s) in the P-Early-Media header field includes
\"recvonly\" and the last received SDP direction attribute from the
functional entity is \"sendrecv\" or \"recvonly\" or no SDP direction
parameter has been received; or

4\) the P-CSCF shall set the \"fStatus\" attribute to \"DISABLED\" if
either the received em-param(s) in the P-Early-Media header field or the
last received SDP direction attribute from the functional entity
includes \"inactive\"; or

5\) the P-CSCF may set the \"fStatus\" attribute to \"DISABLED\" or
apply the rules defined in subclause A.2.2 if the received em-param(s)
in the P-Early-Media header field includes \"sendonly\" or \"recvonly\"
and the last received SDP direction attribute from the functional entity
is \"recvonly\" or \"sendonly\" respectively.

NOTE 2: According to IETF RFC 5009 \[35\], the non-direction parameter
\"gated\" can be included after the direction parameter (e.g.
\"sendrecv\") in the parameter list. The proxy performing gating of
early media can add the parameter before forwarding the SIP message.

When a SIP message without the P-Early-Media header field is received
from either the functional entity within the trust domain or the UE that
is authorized to send early media, then the P-CSCF may set the
\"fStatus\" attribute to \"DISABLED\" or apply the rules defined in
subclause B.2.3 or apply the rules defined in 3GPP TS 29.513 \[7\]
subclause 7.3.3.

NOTE 3: As indicated in IETF RFC 5009 \[35\] the applicable
preconditions need to be met in order to allow early media in a
particular direction.

When a SIP message is received from the functional entity other than the
functional entity within the trust domain or the UE that is authorized
to send early media, then the P-CSCF shall not use the received
em-param(s) in the P-Early-Media header field and may apply the rules
defined in subclause B.2.2 or apply the rules defined in
3GPP TS 29.513 \[7\] subclause 7.3.3.

NOTE 4: The P-CSCF will remove or modify the P-Early-Media header field
in the above case.

B.2.3 Gate control procedures based on the configuration in the P-CSCF
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Prior to the completion of the SIP session set-up, the P-CSCF may
downgrade the values of the \"fStatus\" attributes derived from the SDP
direction attributes based on the configuration in the P-CSCF. If the
P-CSCF has the configuration for the gate control of early media, the
P-CSCF shall perform the following procedures.

NOTE: The gate control of early media can be configured in the P-CSCF
per UE basis.

When the \"fStatus\" attribute derived from the SDP direction attribute
is \"ENABLED\", then the P-CSCF may downgrade the value of the
\"fStatus\" attribute to the value \"DISABLED\", \"ENABLED\_UPLINK\", or
\"ENABLED\_DOWNLINK\" based on the configuration in the P-CSCF.

When the \"fStatus\" attribute derived from the SDP direction attribute
is \"ENABLED\_UPLINK\" or \"ENABLED\_DOWNLINK\", then the P-CSCF may
downgrade the value of the \"fStatus\" attribute to the value
\"DISABLED\" based on the configuration in the P-CSCF.

B.3 Support for SIP forking
===========================

The P-CSCF shall be able to handle forking when PCC is applied and the
\"IMS\_SBI\" feature is supported. Forking can occur as specified in
3GPP TS 23.228 \[33\]. The related UE procedures are described in
3GPP TS 24.229 \[32\].

B.3.1 PCC rule provisioning for early media for forked responses
----------------------------------------------------------------

When a SIP session has been originated by a connected UE, the P-CSCF may
receive multiple provisional responses due to forking before the first
final answer is received. Multiple early media session may be
established during this process.

The UE and the P-CSCF become aware of the forking only when a subsequent
provisional response arrives for a new early dialogue. After the first
early media session is established, for each subsequent provisional
response establishing an additional early media session, the P-CSCF
shall use an Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization\_Update service operation
containing the \"sipForkInd\" attribute with value
\"SEVERAL\_DIALOGUES\" and include the service information derived from
the latest provisional response.

The P-CSCF shall also provision the service information derived from any
subsequent SDP offer-answer exchange within an early dialogue (e.g. in
PRACK and OK(PRACK), or UPDATE and OK(UPDATE) ) using an
Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization\_Update service operation containing the
\"sipForkInd\" attribute with value \"SEVERAL\_DIALOGUES\" and the
derived service information.

When receiving an Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization\_Update service operation
containing the \"sipForkInd\" attribute with value
\"SEVERAL\_DIALOGUES\", the PCF shall identify the existing \"Individual
Application Session Context\" resource with existing authorization
information.

The PCF shall send additional PCC Rules or individual service data flow
filters to already provided PCC rules as required by the \"fDescs\"
attribute within the AF session context information to the SMF. The PCF
shall authorize any additional media components and any increased QoS
requirements for the previously authorized media components, as
requested within the service information.

The PCF shall authorize the maximum bandwidth required by any of the
dialogues, but not the sum of the bandwidths required by all dialogues.
Thus, the QoS authorized for a media component is equal to the highest
QoS requested for that media component by any of the forked responses.

The PCF shall open or close the gates for service flows depending on the
flow status that is being provisioned. However, if a flow ID has been
enabled in uplink or downlink direction or both way within previous
service information, it shall remain enabled even if the PCF receives
service information that disable this flow ID within an
Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization\_Update service operation containing the
\"sipForkInd\" attribute with value \"SEVERAL\_DIALOGUES\".

If the P-CSCF provides one or more media components within the
\"medComponents\" attribute with the \"fStatus\" attribute set to
\"REMOVED\" for previously authorized media component(s) the media
component shall remain as authorized and the PCF shall not take any
action on that media component(s).

NOTE: There can be cases where a forked response could not support some
of the media components included in the SDP Offer (e.g. when early
session disposition SDP as described in Annex B.6 applies, the forked
response related to the early session could include the port set to zero
for those media components not related to the early session or when a
subsequent SDP Offer-Answer to indicate that some media is disabled).
For those cases the P-CSCF will indicate the PCF about the removal of
the corresponding media component. However this media component is
already supported by other UEs and the PCF needs to maintain the
corresponding PCC rules until the final SDP answer is received in the
P-CSCF in order to avoid the release of resources in the network.

B.3.2 Updating the provisioned PCC rules at the final answer
------------------------------------------------------------

The P-CSCF shall store the SDP information for each early dialogue
separately till the first final SIP answer is received. Then the related
early dialogue is progressed to an established dialogue to establish the
final SIP session. All the other early dialogues are terminated. The
service information for the SIP session is updated to match the
requirements of the remaining early dialogue only.

When receiving the first final SIP response, the P-CSCF shall send an
Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization\_Update service operation setting to null the
\"sipForkInd\" attribute and shall include the service information
derived from the SDP corresponding to the dialogue of the final
response. The P-CSCF shall provision the full service information
including the applicable \"fDescs\" attribute and \"fStatus\" attribute.

When receiving an Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization\_Update service operation
with a \"sipForkInd\" attribute with value \"SINGLE\_DIALOGUE\", the PCF
shall update installed PCC Rules information and Authorized-QoS
information to match only the requirements of the service information
within this Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization\_Update service operation. The PCF
should immediately remove PCC Rule(s) or individual service data flow
filters not matching IP flow(s) in the updated Service Information, to
reduce the risk for initial clipping of the media stream, and to
minimize possible misuse of resources. The PCF shall also open or close
the gates for service flows according to the flow status in the received
service information.

B.4 Notification of AF Signalling Transmission Path Status
==========================================================

When the P-CSCF receives an initial REGISTER SIP message from an
attached UE, the P-CSCF may subscribe to notifications of the status of
the AF signalling transmission path using the procedures specified in
subclause 4.2.6.7. Once the P-CSCF has subscribed, the P-CSCF may
receive notifications from the PCF according to subclause 4.2.5.10.

NOTE: This procedure is not applicable for IMS registrations for
Emergency sessions.

The P-CSCF shall cancel the subscription to notification of the status
of the AF signalling transmission path when the AF signalling to that
particular user is terminated (i.e. when the user is de-REGISTERED from
the IM CN subsystem).

When the P-CSCF receives a notification of loss of signalling
connectivity from the PCF, the P-CSCF shall behave as defined in
3GPP TS 24.229 \[32\].

B.5 Indication of Emergency Registration and Session Establishment
==================================================================

When the P-CSCF receives an initial REGISTER SIP message for an IMS
emergency registration or an INVITE SIP message for an emergency session
and the P-CSCF determines that there are no IMS-level roaming
interfaces, and the \"IMS\_SBI\" feature is supported the P-CSCF may
request the PCF to provide the 5GS-Level UE identities (GPSI, SUPI, PEI)
available for that PDU session using the procedure as specified in this
subclause (for an IMS emergency registration) or B.5.1 (for an IMS
emergency session establishment).

A P-CSCF may request the PCF to provide the 5GS-level identities (GPSI,
SUPI, PEI) available for that PDU session when no service information is
available in the AF. To do so, the P-CSCF shall create an \"Individual
Application Session Context\" resource in the PCF for the AF signalling
using an Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization\_Create service operation. The P-CSCF
shall provide the UE's IP address (using either the \"ueIpv4\" attribute
or the \"ueIpv6\" attribute) and the \"afReqData\" attribute set to
\"UE\_IDENTITY\". The AF shall include the \"servUrn\" attribute set to
the value \"sos\", in order to indicate that the new AF session context
relates to emergency traffic that is not related to a specific emergency
service.

If the P-CSCF supports the SBI Message Priority mechanism for an
emergency session, it shall include the \"3gpp‑Sbi‑Message‑Priority\"
custom HTTP header towards the PCF as described in subclause 6.8.2 of
3GPP TS 29.500 \[5\].

NOTE: If the P-CSCF supports the SBI Message Priority mechanism for an
emergency session, the P-CSCF includes the \"3gpp-Sbi-Message-Priority\"
custom HTTP header based on P-CSCF policies in relation to valid values
of the \"servUrn\" attribute. The highest user priority value is mapped
to the corresponding lowest value of the \"3gpp-Sbi-Message-Priority\"
custom HTTP header.

When the PCF receives an Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization\_Create service
operation as described in the preceding paragraphs from the P-CSCF, the
PCF shall perform session binding as described in 3GPP TS 29.513 \[7\].
When the PCF receives the \"servUrn\" attribute indicating an emergency
session, the PCF may apply special policies, for instance prioritising
service flows relating to the AF session context or allowing these
service flows free of charge.

When the \"servUrn\" attribute indicates that the AF session context
relates to emergency traffic and the \"afReqData\" attribute is received
indicating \"UE\_IDENTITY\", the PCF shall provide the requested
available user information (GPSI, SUPI, PEI) for the PDU session within
\"ueIds\" attribute within the \"ascRespData\" in the HTTP \"201
Created\" response.

When the P-CSCF receives the HTTP \"201 Created\" response with the
5GS-level UE identities from the PCF, the P-CSCF stores the \"ueIds\"
received within \"Individual Application Session Context\" resource
returned in the HTTP \"201 Created\" response and behaves as defined in
3GPP TS 24.229 \[32\].

NOTE: The user information received within the \"ueIds\" attribute can
be used to support PSAP callback functionality for anonymous IMS
emergency sessions. See 3GPP TS 23.167 \[40\] for further information.

The P-CSCF may decide to delete the \"Individual Application Session
Context\" resource at any time. In that case, the
Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization\_Delete service operation, as described in
subclause 4.2.4.2.

A SIP INVITE request can contain a service URN as defined in
IETF RFC 5031 \[34\] within the request URI. If the service within this
URN is \"sos\", possibly with additional sub-service information, the
P-CSCF shall provision this service and sub-service information within
the \"servUrn\" attribute towards the PCF. The P-CSCF may also provision
possible information about other services received within the service
URN.

B.6 Support for Early Session disposition SDP
=============================================

B.6.1 General
-------------

As a network option, when the \"IMS\_SBI\" feature is supported, the
P-CSCF may support the PCC procedures in the present subclause to handle
\"early session\" disposition type SDP, as standardised in
IETF RFC 3959 \[38\].

B.6.2 Service Information Provisioning for Early Media
------------------------------------------------------

The P-CSCF can receive \"early session\" disposition SDP in addition to
\"session\" disposition SDP in SIP early dialogues.

The P-CSCF shall then provision service information derived both from
the \"early session\" disposition SDP and \"session\" disposition SDP
applying the procedures in clauses B.1, B.2, and B.3, and in the present
subclause.

The P-CSCF shall apply the mapping rules in Annex C to derive the flow
identifiers from \"early session\" disposition SDP.

If a single media line with one media type (e.g. \"audio\" or \"video\")
is contained in \"early session\" disposition SDP and a single media
line with the same media type is contained in the \"session\"
disposition SDP of the same SIP dialogue, and both media lines describe
service flows of the same directionality (uplink, downlink, or
bidirectional), the P-CSCF should describe those SDP media lines in the
same session information media component (with the same flow ID).

The \"early session\" disposition SDP can also contain media lines of a
type not included in the \"session\" disposition SDP, or several media
lines of the same type. Such media components shall be described in own
media components in the service information.

If the P-CSCF desires to invoke special policies or separate event
notifications for an \"early session\" disposition media line, it may
choose to provision a separate session information media component even
if a media line with the same media type and directionality is contained
in \"session\" disposition SDP.

NOTE 1: A PCF is then likely to supply separate PCC rules for early
media and the corresponding final media. This may lead to an over
provisioning of resources during call establishment and a subsequent
reconfiguration of the radio bearer, or even to a call failure if the
extra resources are not authorized or available.

If the P-CSCF receives \"early session\" disposition SDP before any
\"session\" disposition SDP and supplies service information derived
from the \"early session\" disposition SDP at this point of time, it
shall use dedicated media components relating only to the \"early
session\" disposition SDP in the service information.

NOTE 2: The \"session\" disposition SDP offer will frequently occur
before the \"early session\" disposition SDP offer, but can also occur
in parallel or in exceptional cases afterwards. The \"session\"
disposition SDP answer can be contained in the same SIP message as the
\"early session\" disposition SDP offer, or can be sent in a 200 OK
(INVITE), i.e. after the \"early session\" disposition SDP answer.

If the P-CSCF includes any media component relating both to \"early
session\" disposition SDP and \"session\" disposition SDP in the service
information, the P-CSCF shall:

\- provision the service information derived from \"early session\"
disposition SDP and the service information derived from \"session\"
disposition SDP in separate Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization\_Update requests
(to the same \"Individual Application Session Context\" resource), and
shall send a new Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization\_Update request only after
any previous Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization\_Update request has been
acknowledged; and

\- provision the first service information (either derived from \"early
session\" disposition SDP or \"session\" disposition SDP) without the
\"sipForkInd\" attribute, or with \"sipForkInd\" attribute with value
\"SINGLE\_DIALOGUE\"; and

\- provision all subsequent service information during ongoing call
establishment with the \"sipForkInd\" attribute with value
SEVERAL\_DIALOGUES; and

\- if an SDP answer has been received and codecs are provisioned within
the \"codecs\" attribute included in a media component of the
\"medComponents\" attribute, provision within a \"codecs\" attribute the
codec derived from the corresponding offer together with a codec derived
from the SDP answer.

NOTE 3: The P-CSCF needs to provision the service information derived
from \"early session\" disposition SDP and the service information
derived from \"session\" disposition SDP in separate
Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization\_Update requests because the encoding of the
media component does not allow for the simultaneous provisioning of two
corresponding filters.

NOTE 4: The PCF will treat service information containing the
\"sipForkInd\" attribute as described in subclause B.3.

B.6.3 Updating the Provisioned Service Information when Dialogue is established
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The P-CSCF shall store the SDP information for the \"session\"
disposition type until the first final SIP answer is received. Then the
early media described in the \"early session\" disposition type SDP are
terminated.

The P-CSCF shall then update the service information to match the
requirements of the media described in the \"session\" disposition type
SDP only:

\- If the P-CSCF included any media component relating both to \"early
session\" disposition SDP and \"session\" disposition SDP in the service
information, the P-CSCF shall send an Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization\_Update
request without the \"sipForkInd\" attribute or with a \"sipForkInd\"
attribute with value SINGLE\_DIALOGUE and shall include the service
information derived from the \"session\" disposition SDP. The P-CSCF
shall provision the full service information including the applicable
\"fDescs\" attribute and \"fStatus\" attribute.

\- The P-CSCF shall disable any media component(s) in the service
information that relate to early media only by setting their flow status
to \"REMOVED\".

B.7 Provision of Signalling Flow Information at P-CSCF
======================================================

When the P-CSCF has successfully concluded the initial registration of
an attached UE, i.e., when the P-CSCF has sent to the UE a SIP 200 (OK)
response to the SIP REGISTER request, the P-CSCF may provision
information about the SIP signalling flows between the UE and itself
using the procedure specified in subclause 4.2.2.16. If the P-CSCF
already has created an \"Individual Application Session Context\"
resource with the PCF related to the signalling with the UE, e.g. one
that has been opened according to the procedure described in clause B.4,
the P-CSCF shall reuse the already open session to provision the SIP
Signalling IP Flow information using the procedure specified in
subclause 4.2.3.17.

NOTE: This procedure is not applicable for IMS registrations for
Emergency sessions.

If the P-CSCF provisions information about SIP signalling flows, the
P-CSCF shall ensure that for each signalling IP flow information it
provides, the flow descriptions within the \"fDescs\" attribute shall
accurately reflect the IP flow information as seen in the IP header \'on
the wire\'. The P-CSCF shall set the value of the \"afSigProtocol\"
attribute to \"SIP\".

When the P-CSCF de-registers the UE and terminates SIP Signalling to the
UE, the P-CSCF shall de-provision the SIP Signalling IP flow information
from the PCRF as described in subclauses 4.2.2.16 and 4.2.3.17.

B.8 Retrieval of network provided location information
======================================================

B.8.1 General
-------------

According to clause E.7 of 3GPP TS 23.228 \[33\], the P-CSCF can use PCC
to retrieve network provided location information. Information flows
related to the distribution of network provided location information
within the IMS are provided in Annex R of 3GPP TS 23.228 \[33\].

The following subclauses provide optional PCC procedures to support the
retrieval of network provided location information.

The originating P-CSCF can, depending on operator policy, retrieve the
user location and/or UE Time Zone information either before sending the
INVITE towards the terminating side or upon reception of the SDP answer
from the terminating side.

B.8.2 Retrieval of network provided location information at originating P-CSCF for inclusion in SIP Request
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If the originating P-CSCF is required by operator policy to retrieve
network provided location information before forwarding a SIP INVITE
request, upon reception of the SIP INVITE/UPDATE request, the P-CSCF
shall invoke:

\- the Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization\_Create service operation according to
subclause 4.2.2.14 (SIP INVITE request); or

\- the Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization\_Update service operation according to
subclause 4.2.3.14 or the Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization\_Subscribe service
operation according to subclause 4.2.6.6 (SIP INVITE/UPDATE request);

including in the corresponding HTTP request:

\- an entry of the \"AfEventSubscription\" data type in the \"events\"
attribute with:

a\) the \"event\" attribute set to the value \"ANI\_REPORT\"; and

b\) the \"notifMethod\" attribute set to the value \"ONE\_TIME\"; and

\- the \"reqAnis\" attribute, with the required access network
information, i.e. user location and/or user time zone information).

If the SIP INVITE request is an initial SIP INVITE request, the P-CSCF
shall create a new \"Individual Application Session Context\" for the
new SIP session with the Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization\_Subscribe service
operation according to subclause 4.2.6.6 (if no session information is
included) or with the Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization\_Create service
operation according to subclause 4.2.2.14 (if preliminary session
information is included).

The P-CSCF will receive the access network information from the PCF
within the Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization\_Notify service operation as
described in subclause 4.2.5.11 and should include this access network
information in the SIP INVITE/UPDATE requests that it forwards. When the
retrieved access network information corresponds to the \"tnapId\" or
\"twapId\" attribute, the P-CSCF may also map the retrieved access
network information to a Geographical Identifier for routing, as
specified in clause E.8 of 3GPP TS 23.228 \[33\].

B.8.3 Retrieval of network provided location information at originating P-CSCF for inclusion in SIP response confirmation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If an originating P-CSCF is required by operator policy to retrieve
network provided location information before forwarding an SDP answer,
the P-CSCF shall apply the following procedures.

Upon reception of an SDP offer, the P-CSCF may invoke the
Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization\_Create service operation to the PCF according
to clause B.1 and may include in the corresponding HTTP POST request:

\- an entry of the \"AfEventSubscription\" data type in the \"events\"
attribute with:

a\) the \"event\" attribute set to the value \"ANI\_REPORT\"; and

b\) the \"notifMethod\" attribute set to the value \"ONE\_TIME\"; and

\- the \"reqAnis\" attribute, with the required access network
information, i.e. user location and/or user time zone information).

Upon reception of an SDP answer, the P-CSCF will invoke the
Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization\_Update service operation to the PCF according
to clause B.1. If the P-CSCF has not requested access network
information upon reception of the SDP offer, the P-CSCF shall include in
the corresponding HTTP PATCH request:

\- an entry of the \"AfEventSubscription\" data type in the \"events\"
attribute with:

a\) the \"event\" attribute set to the value \"ANI\_REPORT\"; and

b\) the \"notifMethod\" attribute set to the value \"ONE\_TIME\"; and

\- the \"reqAnis\" attribute, with the required access network
information, i.e. user location and/or user time zone information).

The P-CSCF will receive the access network information from the PCF in
the Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization\_Notify service operation and should
include this access network information in the SIP message with the
response confirmation before forwarding it. When the retrieved access
network information corresponds to the \"tnapId\" or \"twapId\"
attribute, the P-CSCF may also map the retrieved access network
information to a Geographical Identifier for routing, as specified in
clause E.8 of 3GPP TS 23.228 \[33\].

B.8.4 Retrieval of network provided location information at terminating P-CSCF
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If a terminating P-CSCF is required by operator policy to retrieve
network provided location information at session establishment and/or
modification, the P-CSCF shall apply the following procedures.

The terminating P-CSCF may request network provided location information
upon reception of a SIP INVITE request in the following manner:

\- if the SIP INVITE request is an initial SIP INVITE request, the
P-CSCF shall create a new \"Individual Application Session Context\" for
the new SIP session with the Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization\_Subscribe
service operation according to subclause 4.2.6.6 (if no session
information is included) or with the Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization\_Create
service operation according to subclause 4.2.2.14 (if preliminary
session information is included);

\- if the SIP INVITE contains an SDP offer, the P-CSCF shall include in
the corresponding HTTP request:

a\) an entry of the \"AfEventSubscription\" data type in the \"events\"
attribute with:

\(i\) the \"event\" attribute set to the value \"ANI\_REPORT\"; and

\(ii\) the \"notifMethod\" attribute set to the value \"ONE\_TIME\";

b\) the \"reqAnis\" attribute, with the required access network
information, i.e. user location and/or user time zone information);

c\) service information derived from the SDP offer; and

d\) the \"servInfStatus\" attribute with the value set to
\"PRELIMINARY\"; and

\- if the SIP INVITE does not contain an SDP offer, the P-CSCF shall
include in the corresponding HTTP request:

a\) an entry of the \"AfEventSubscription\" data type in the \"events\"
attribute with:

\(i\) the \"event\" attribute set to the value \"ANI\_REPORT\"; and

\(ii\) the \"notifMethod\" attribute set to the value \"ONE\_TIME\"; and

b\) the \"reqAnis\" attribute, with the required access network
information, i.e. user location and/or user time zone information).

Upon reception of a SIP response that requires the inclusion of access
network information, if the P-CSCF has not already requested network
provided location information upon reception of the corresponding SIP
INVITE request, the P-CSCF shall request network provided location
information in the following manner:

\- if an \"Individual Application Session Context\" related to service
data has not yet been created, the P-CSCF shall create an \"Individual
Application Session Context\" for the new SIP session with the
Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization\_Subscribe service operation according to
subclause 4.2.6.6 (if no session information is included) or with the
Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization\_Create service operation according to
subclause 4.2.2.14 (if session information is included);

\- if the SIP response includes an SDP answer, the P-CSCF shall send an
HTTP request to the PCF according to clause B.1; the P-CSCF shall
include in this HTTP request:

a\) an entry of the \"AfEventSubscription\" data type in the \"events\"
attribute with:

\(i\) the \"event\" attribute set to the value \"ANI\_REPORT\"; and

\(ii\) the \"notifMethod\" attribute set to the value \"ONE\_TIME\"; and

b\) the \"reqAnis\" attribute, with the required access network
information, i.e. user location and/or user time zone information);

\- if the SIP response does not contain an SDP body, the P-CSCF shall
include in the corresponding HTTP request:

a\) an entry of the \"AfEventSubscription\" data type in the \"events\"
attribute with:

\(i\) the \"event\" attribute set to the value \"ANI\_REPORT\"; and

\(ii\) the \"notifMethod\" attribute set to the value \"ONE\_TIME\"; and

b\) the \"reqAnis\" attribute, with the required access network
information, i.e. user location and/or user time zone information); and

\- if the SIP response includes an SDP offer, the P-CSCF shall include
in the corresponding HTTP request:

\- a) an entry of the \"AfEventSubscription\" data type in the
\"events\" attribute with:

\(i\) the \"event\" attribute set to the value \"ANI\_REPORT\"; and

\(ii\) the \"notifMethod\" attribute set to the value \"ONE\_TIME\";

b\) the \"reqAnis\" attribute, with the required access network
information, i.e. user location and/or user time zone information);

c\) service information derived from the SDP offer; and

d\) the \"servInfStatus\" attribute with the value set to
\"PRELIMINARY\".

The P-CSCF will receive the access network information from the PCF in
the Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization\_Notify service operation and should
include this access network information in the appropriate SIP response
before forwarding it. When the retrieved access network information
corresponds to the \"tnapId\" or \"twapId\" attribute, the P-CSCF may
also map the retrieved access network information to a Geographical
Identifier for routing, as specified in clause E.8 of
3GPP TS 23.228 \[33\].

B.8.5 Provisioning of network provided location information at SIP session release
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If a P-CSCF is required by operator policy to include network provided
location information in SIP session release signalling, the P-CSCF shall
apply the following procedures:

Upon reception of a SIP session release request that requires the
inclusion of network provided location information, the P-CSCF will
invoke the Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization\_Delete service operation to the
PCF according to subclause 4.2.4.6 and shall include in the HTTP
request:

\- an entry of the \"AfEventSubscription\" data type in the \"events\"
attribute with:

a\) the \"event\" attribute set to the value \"ANI\_REPORT\"; and

b\) the \"notifMethod\" attribute set to the value \"ONE\_TIME\"; and

\- the \"reqAnis\" attribute, with the required access network
information, i.e. user location and/or user time zone information).

The P-CSCF will receive the access network information from the PCF in
the Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization\_Delete service operation according to
subclause 4.2.4.6 and shall include this access network information in
the appropriate SIP message before forwarding it. When the retrieved
access network information corresponds to the \"tnapId\" or \"twapId\"
attribute, the P-CSCF may also map the retrieved access network
information to a Geographical Identifier for routing, as specified in
clause E.8 of 3GPP TS 23.228 \[33\].

B.9 Resource Sharing
====================

The P-CSCF may indicate to the PCF that media of an \"Individual
Application Session Context\" resource may share resources with media
belonging to other \"Individual Application Session Context\" resources
according to 3GPP TS 23.228 \[33\].

If the P-CSCF determines that resource sharing is possible, it may at
creation of a new \"Individual Application Session Context\" resource,
include the \"sharingKeyUl\" attribute and/or \"sharingKeyDl\" attribute
indicating that media resources may be shared in the related direction.
The P-CSCF shall assign a distinct value for the \"sharingKeyUl\"
attribute and/or \"sharingKeyDl\" attribute for each media component
within the \"medComponents\" attribute.

NOTE 1: When resource sharing applies to both directions for a certain
media component, the P-CSCF can assign the same value for
\"sharingKeyUl\" attribute and \"sharingKeyDl\" attribute within the
same media component.

The P-CSCF shall not include the \"sharingKeyUl\" attribute and/or
\"sharingKeyDl\" attribute within the media components in the
\"medComponents\" attribute when the \"Individual Application Session
Context\" resource relates to an Emergency Session.

The PCF shall not include the \"sharingKeyUl\" attribute and/or
\"sharingKeyDl\" attribute for those PCC/QoS Rules related to the RTCP
traffic.

Trigger conditions that require applying or stopping resource sharing
are described in 3GPP TS 24.229 \[32\].

NOTE 2: When P-CSCF needs to stop sharing according to the procedures
described in 3GPP TS 24.229 \[32\], the P-CSCF will provide \"null\"
value for the \"sharingKeyUl\" attribute and/or \"sharingKeyDl\"
attribute within the media component in the \"medComponents\" attribute.

B.10 Handling of MCPTT priority call
====================================

B.10.1 General
--------------

Within the framework of MCPTT, when the SIP Core (3GPP TS 24.379 \[41\])
is implemented by an IMS core network, if the P-CSCF receives a SIP
request message including a Resource-Priority header field with a
namespace field and priority value defined for MCPTT for adjusting the
priority of an MCPTT session, the P-CSCF shall provide the \"resPrio\"
attribute and the \"mcpttId\" in the Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization\_Create
request as defined in subclause B.13.2 to allow the PCF to set the
corresponding PCC rule(s) according to the prioritized MCPTT service.
Additionally, if \"PrioritySharing\" feature is supported, the P-CSCF
may provide the \"prioSharingInd\" attribute within the media component
included in the \"medComponents\" attribute as described in clause B.1.
For MCPTT the service priority and the priority sharing indicator are
defined in 3GPP TS 24.379 \[41\].

NOTE 1: The process of adjusting priority may occur several times during
the course of one session, e.g. a normal MCPTT group call elevated to an
MCPTT emergency group call, returned to a normal priority MCPTT group
call, elevated to an MCPTT imminent peril group call and returned to a
normal priority MCPTT group call.

NOTE 2: Upon reception of a request that requires the adjustment of the
MCPTT priority, the PCF is expected to derive the PCC Rules
corresponding to the this MCPTT session, as appropriate according to
operator policies.

NOTE 3: The PCF can identify an MCPTT call using the IMS Communication
Service Identifier specific to MCPTT, which is provided by the P-CSCF in
the \"afAppId\" attribute in the Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization\_Create
request sent to PCF.

B.10.2 Determination of MCPTT priority parameter values
-------------------------------------------------------

When the P-CSCF receives an authorized Resource-Priority header field
containing an appropriate namespace and priority value used for MCPTT in
SIP signalling, the P-CSCF shall include the \"mcpttId\" attribute and
the \"resPrio\" attribute in the corresponding Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization
service operation towards the PCF.

The \"mcpttId\" attribute shall include the namespace defined for MCPTT
as received within the Resource-Priority header field.

NOTE: Two different values are defined for the MCPTT-Identifier AVP, one
for each namespace value defined for MCPTT (see IETF RFC 8101 \[42\]).

The \"resPrio\" attribute shall contain the priority value of the
Resource-Priority header; the lowest priority shall be mapped to PRIO\_1
(Resource-Priority header value 0), the next after the lowest to PRIO\_2
(Resource-Priority header value 1), and so on up to the highest priority
which shall be mapped to PRIO\_16 (Resource-Priority header value 15).

Additionally, when the P-CSCF receives information about priority
sharing from an MCPTT server that supports simultaneous sessions and
that needs to share a common priority for several MCPTT sessions and if
\"PrioritySharing\" feature is supported, the P-CSCF may include the
\"prioSharingInd\" attribute within the media component received in the
\"medComponents\" attribute in the corresponding
Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization service operation. See 3GPP TS 24.379 \[41\]
for further information.

B.11 Handling of MCVideo priority call
======================================

B.11.1 General
--------------

Within the framework of MCVideo, when the SIP Core
(3GPP TS 23.281 \[34\]) is implemented by an IMS core network, if the
P-CSCF receives a SIP request message including a Resource-Priority
header field with a namespace field and priority value defined for
MCVideo for adjusting the priority of an MCVideo session, the P-CSCF
shall provide the \"resPrio\" attribute and the \"mcVideoId\" in the
Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization\_Create request as defined in subclause B.15.2
to allow the PCF to set the corresponding PCC rule(s) according to the
prioritized MCVideo service.

NOTE 1: The process of adjusting priority may occur several times during
the course of one session, e.g. a normal MCVideo group call elevated to
an MCVideo emergency group call and returned to a normal priority
MCVideo group call, elevated to an MCVideo imminent peril group call and
returned to a normal priority MCVideo group call.

NOTE 2: Upon reception of a request that requires the adjustment of the
MCVideo priority, the PCF is expected to derive the PCC Rules
corresponding to the this MCVideo session, as appropriate according to
operator policies.

NOTE 3: The PCF can identify an MCVideo call using the IMS Communication
Service Identifier specific to MCVideo, which is provided by the P-CSCF
in the \"afAppId\" attribute in the Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization\_Create
request sent to PCF.

B.11.2 Determination of MCVideo priority parameter values
---------------------------------------------------------

When the P-CSCF receives an authorized Resource-Priority header field
containing an appropriate namespace and priority value used for MCVideo
in SIP signalling, the P-CSCF shall include the \"mcVideoId\" attribute
and the \"resPrio\" attribute in the corresponding
Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization service operation towards the PCF.

The \"mcVideoId\" attribute shall include the namespace defined for
MCVideo as received within the Resource-Priority header field.

The \"resPrio\" attribute shall contain the priority value of the
Resource-Priority header; the lowest priority shall be mapped to PRIO\_1
(Resource-Priority header value 0), the next after the lowest to PRIO\_2
(Resource-Priority header value 1), and so on up to the highest priority
which shall be mapped to PRIO\_16 (Resource-Priority header value 15).

B.12 Notification Access Type Change
====================================

When the P-CSCF receives an initial SIP REGISTER message or a SIP INVITE
message from an attached UE, the P-CSCF may request from the PCF the
information about the access type the UE is attached to using the
procedure specified in subclauses 4.2.2.2, 4.2.3.2 and 4.2.6.2.

NOTE 1: This procedure is not applicable for IMS registrations for
Emergency sessions.

NOTE 2: The P-CSCF can request information about the access type as part
of the SIP session setup when it is only interested in the related
information when the IMS session is ongoing.

If the P-CSCF requests information about the access type, the P-CSCF
shall also subscribe within the same Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization service
operation to notifications for changes of the access type used by the
UE. The P-CSCF shall include an entry of the \"AfEventSubscription\"
data type in the \"events\" attribute with the \"event\" attribute set
to the value \"ACCESS\_TYPE\_CHANGE\".

When the P-CSCF receives from the PCF the access type:

\- in the subscription request response within the HTTP response; or

\- in the notification of access type change in an HTTP POST request
from the PCF,

the P-CSCF shall store the access type information received within the
\"accessType\" attribute and the RAT type information received within
\"ratType\" attribute and use the received information as per P-CSCF
procedures in 3GPP TS 24.229 \[32\].

The P-CSCF may receive subsequent notifications for changes of the
access type from the PCF according to subclause 4.2.5.2. When the P-CSCF
receives a notification of the change of the access type used by the UE,
the P-CSCF shall store the new access type information and RAT type
information and use the received information as per P-CSCF procedures in
3GPP TS 24.229 \[32\].

NOTE 3: The subscription to receive information about the access type
will be cancelled when the corresponding Individual Application Session
Context resource is removed by the AF (i.e. when the UE is de‑REGISTERED
or the related SIP call is released).

B.13 Notification of PLMN Change
================================

When the P-CSCF receives an initial SIP REGISTER message from an
attached UE, the P-CSCF may subscribe to notifications of PLMN changes
corresponding to the identity of the network where the UE is located
using the procedure specified in subclauses 4.2.2.2, 4.2.3.2 and
4.2.6.2.

When the P-CSCF receives the subscription request response in an HTTP
response or the notification of PLMN change in an HTTP POST request from
the PCF, the P-CSCF shall store the PLMN identifier and, if available,
the NID received within the \"plmnId\" attribute and use the received
information as per P-CSCF procedures in 3GPP TS 24.229 \[32\].

The P-CSCF shall cancel the subscription to notification for changes of
the PLMN used by the UE when the user is de-registered from the IM CN
subsystem.

B.14 Coverage and Handoff Enhancements using Multimedia error robustness feature (CHEM)
=======================================================================================

As a network option, the P-CSCF may support the PCC procedures in the
present clause to handle the Coverage and Handoff Enhancements using
Multimedia error robustness feature (CHEM).

NOTE: When the CHEM feature is supported, improved error robustness
might be enabled by packet-loss handling procedures of the codec, codec
mode, or codec configuration to avoid, delay, or reduce the need to
handoff a terminal due to degradation in the media quality.
Communicating the level of robustness of the media to the network
enables the eNB to use this information to determine a threshold for
when the terminal should be handed off to another cell, domain
(circuit-switched vs. packet-switched), or radio access technology.

When a session is initiated or modified the P-CSCF supporting the CHEM
feature shall derive the \"maxPacketLossRateDl\" attribute and
\"maxPacketLossRateUl\" attribute based on the PLR\_adapt and maxe2e-PLR
attribute values in both the SDP offer and/or SDP answer to determine
the maximum tolerable end-to-end PLR budget distributed across the
uplink and downlink in a media transport path as described in
3GPP TS 29.513 \[7\] subclause 7.2.3.

Upon reception of SDP offer and answer, the P-CSCF should check whether
\"a= PLR\_adapt\" line is present in both SDP offer and answer to derive
\"maxPacketLossRateDl\" attribute and \"maxPacketLossRateUl\" attribute
in \"medComponents\" attribute else \"maxPacketLossRateDl\" and
\"maxPacketLossRateUl\" attributes are not included by the P-CSCF.

The originating P-CSCF should derive \"maxPacketLossRateDl\" attribute
to the maximum value of MaxPacketLossRateDl among all the RTP payload
types. For each RTP payload type MaxPacketLossRateDl is computed as
described in 3GPP TS 29.513 \[7\] subclause 7.2.3.

\- If maxe2e-PLR is included in the SDP offer then the
MaxPacketLossRateDl for a payload type is derived as value of maxe2e-PLR
in the SDP offer minus maxUL-PLR in the SDP answer if present else the
MaxPacketLossRateDlis ½ maxe2e-PLR value present in the SDP offer.

\- If maxe2e-PLR is not included in the SDP offer then the
MaxPacketLossRateDl for a payload type is derived from the default value
in end-to-end Maximum End-to-End Packet Loss Rate for the decoder of the
RTP payload type as recommended in 3GPP TS 26.114 \[30\]subclause X.1.2
for application layer redundancy or X.1.1 for partial redundancy minus
maxUL-PLR in the SDP answer if present else the MaxPacketLossRateDl ½
default value in end-to-end Maximum End-to-End Packet Loss Rate for the
decoder of the RTP payload type as recommended in 3GPP TS 26.114 \[30\]
subclause X.1.2 for application layer redundancy or X.1.1 for partial
redundancy.

The originating P-CSCF should derive \"maxPacketLossRateUl\" attribute
to the maximum value of MaxPacketLossRateUl among all the RTP payload
types. For each RTP payload type MaxPacketLossRateUl is computed as
described in 3GPP TS 29.513 \[7\] subclause 7.2.3.

\- If maxe2e-PLR is included in the SDP answer then the
MaxPacketLossRateUl for a payload type is derived as value of maxe2e-PLR
in the SDP answer minus maxDL-PLR in the SDP answer if present else the
MaxPacketLossRateUl is ½ maxe2e-PLR value present in the SDP answer.

\- If maxe2e-PLR is not included in the SDP answer then the
MaxPacketLossRateUl for a payload type is derived as the ½ default value
in end-to-end Maximum End-to-End Packet Loss Rate for the decoder of the
RTP payload type as recommended in 3GPP TS 26.114 \[30\] subclause X.1.2
for application layer redundancy or X.1.1 for partial redundancy.

The terminating P-CSCF should derive \"maxPacketLossRateDl\" attribute
to the maximum value of MaxPacketLossRateDl among all the RTP payload
types. For each RTP payload type MaxPacketLossRateDl is computed as
described in 3GPP TS 29.513 \[7\] subclause 7.2.3.

\- If maxe2e-PLR is included in the SDP answer then the
MaxPacketLossRateDl for a payload type is derived as value of maxDL-PLR
in the SDP answer if present else the MaxPacketLossRateDl is ½
maxe2e-PLR value present in the SDP answer.

\- If maxe2e-PLR is not included in the SDP answer then the
MaxPacketLossRateDl for a payload type is derived as the ½ default value
in end-to-end Maximum End-to-End Packet Loss Rate for the decoder of the
RTP payload type as recommended in 3GPP TS 26.114 \[30\] subclause X.1.2
for application layer redundancy or X.1.1 for partial redundancy.

The terminating P-CSCF should derive \"maxPacketLossRateUl\" attribute
to the maximum value of MaxPacketLossRateUl among all the RTP payload
types. For each RTP payload type MaxPacketLossRateUl is computed as
described in 3GPP TS 29.513 \[7\] subclause 7.2.3.

\- If maxe2e-PLR is included in the SDP offer then the
MaxPacketLossRateUl for a payload type is derived as value of maxUL-PLR
in the SDP answer if present else the MaxPacketLossRateUl is ½
maxe2e-PLR value present in the SDP offer.

\- If maxe2e-PLR is not included in the SDP offer then the
MaxPacketLossRateUl for a payload type is derived as the ½ default value
in end-to-end Maximum End-to-End Packet Loss Rate for the decoder of the
RTP payload type as recommended in 3GPP TS 26.114 \[30\] subclause X.1.2
for application layer redundancy or X.1.1 for partial redundancy.

B.15 Handling of a FLUS session
===============================

If the P-CSCF receives a SIP request that requires provisioning of a
service information to the PCF, the \"FLUS\" feature is supported and an
SDP attribute \"a=label:flus...\" is included in one or more of the
received SDP media descriptions, the P-CSCF shall provide the string
after \"a=label:\" starting with \"flus\" within the \"flusId\"
attribute for each affected media components within the
\"medComponents\" attribute in the corresponding
Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization service operation towards the PCF.

NOTE: During the first interaction with the PCF, the P-CSCF does not
know if the \"FLUS\" feature is supported by the PCF. In this case the
P-CSCF will include the information as if the feature is supported.

If additionally the P-CSCF receives the \"a=3gpp-qos-hint\" media-level
SDP attribute in the SIP request, the P-CSCF shall provide the PCF with
the \"desMaxLatency\" attribute and/or \"desMaxLoss\" attribute as
described in 3GPP TS 29.513 \[7\], subclause 7.2.3.

Upon receiving the information from the P-CSCF and if the \"FLUS\"
feature is supported, the PCF shall derive the QoS information as
described in 3GPP TS 29.513 \[7\], subclause 7.3.3.

B.16 QoS hint support for data channel media
============================================

If the P-CSCF receives a SIP request that requires provisioning of a
service information to the PCF, the QoSHint feature is supported and an
SDP attribute \"a=3gpp-qos-hint\" is included in one or more of the
received data channel media descriptions, the P-CSCF may provide the
\"desMaxLatency\" attribute and/or \"desMaxLoss\" attribute for each
affected application media component within the \"medComponents\"
attribute in the corresponding Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization service
operation towards the PCF.

NOTE: During the first interaction with the PCF, the P-CSCF does not
know if the QoSHint feature is supported by the PCF. In this case the
P-CSCF will include the information as if the feature is supported.

Upon receiving the information from the P-CSCF and if the QoSHint
feature is supported, the PCF shall derive the QoS information as
described in 3GPP TS 29.513 \[7\], subclause 7.3.3.

B.17 Handling of MPS Session
============================

When the P-CSCF receives an authorised Resource-Priority header field or
when the P-CSCF adds a temporarily authorised Resource-Priority header
field containing an appropriate namespace and priority value in SIP
signaling, and recognizes the need for priority treatment as specified
in 3GPP TS 24.229 \[32\], and the \"IMS\_SBI\" feature is supported, the
P-CSCF shall include the \"mpsId\" attribute and the \"resPrio\"
attribute in the corresponding Npcf\_PolicyAuthorization service
operation towards the PCF. The \"mpsId\" attribute shall contain the
national variant for MPS service name indicating an MPS session. The
\"resPrio\" attribute shall be determined based on the resource value
received in the \"wps\" namespace of the SIP Resource-Priority header
field, and shall be included at \"AppSessionContextReqData\" data type
level as well as the \"MediaComponent\" data type level. The \"resPrio\"
attribute shall be populated with a default value if the priority value
is unknown.

NOTE 1: Various mechanisms can be applied to recognize the need for
priority treatment in the P-CSCF (e.g., based on the dialled digits),
according to national regulation and network configuration, as stated in
3GPP TS 24.229 \[32\].

NOTE 2: Highest user priority level (lowest numerical resource value of
the SIP Resource-Priority header field) is mapped to the highest
enumerated value of the \"resPrio\" attribute.

If the P-CSCF supports the SBI Message Priority mechanism for an MPS
session, the P-CSCF shall include the \"3gpp-Sbi-Message-Priority\"
custom HTTP header with a priority value based on the value of the
\"resPrio\" attribute. The highest \"resPrio\" value is mapped to the
corresponding lowest value of the \"3gpp-Sbi-Message-Priority\" custom
HTTP header.

Upon reception of a request that requires MPS treatment, the PCF shall
derive the PCC rules corresponding to the MPS session, as appropriate.
The PCF shall take specific actions on the corresponding PDU session to
ensure that the MPS session is prioritized, as described in
3GPP TS 29.512 \[8\], subclause 4.2.6.2.12.3.

When the P-CSCF detects that the MPS session has ended, the P-CSCF
deletes in the PCF the \"Individual Application Session Context\"
resource corresponding to the MPS session. The PCF shall delete the PCC
rules corresponding to the MPS session and shall revoke the actions
related to the prioritization of the MPS session in the corresponding
PDU session, as described in 3GPP TS 29.512 \[8\],
subclause 4.2.6.2.12.3.

######## Annex C (normative): Flow identifiers: Format definition and examples

C.1 Format of a flow identifier
===============================

C.1.1 General
-------------

A flow identifier is expressed as a 2-tuple as follows:

\<The ordinal number of the position of the media component description
in the SDI. The ordinal number of the IP flow(s) within the media
component description assigned in the order of increasing downlink port
numbers as detailed below.\>

where both are numbered starting from 1. The encoding of the flow
identifier is as indicated in 3GPP TS 24.008 \[36\].

The rules for the allocation of flow identifiers to IP flows are defined
in 3GPP TS 29.214 \[20\], Annex B.1.1. Derivation of flow identifiers
from SDP are described in 3GPP TS 29.214 \[20\], Annex B.1.2, and
examples are covered in 3GPP TS 29.214 \[20\], Annex B2, B3, B4 and B5.
