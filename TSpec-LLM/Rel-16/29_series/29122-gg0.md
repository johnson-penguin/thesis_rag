4 T8 reference point
====================

4.1 Overview
------------

The T8 reference point is between the SCS/AS and the SCEF. It specifies
APIs that allow the SCS/AS to access the services and capabilities
provided by 3GPP network entities and securely exposed by the SCEF.

This document also specifies the procedures triggered at the SCEF by API
requests from the SCS/AS and by event notifications received from 3GPP
network entities.

The stage 2 level requirements and signalling flows for the T8 reference
point are defined in 3GPP TS 23.682 \[2\].

The T8 reference point supports the following procedures:

\- Monitoring Procedures

\- Procedures for resource management of Background Data Transfer

\- Procedures for changing the chargeable party

\- Procedures for Non-IP Data Delivery

\- Procedures for Device Triggering

\- Procedures for Group Message Delivery

\- Procedures for Reporting of Network Status

\- Procedures for Communication Pattern Parameters Provisioning

\- Procedures for PFD Management

\- Procedures for Enhanced Coverage Restriction Control

\- Procedures for Network Parameter Configuration

\- Procedures for setting up an AS session with required QoS

\- Procedures for MSISDN-less Mobile Originated SMS

\- Procedures for RACS Parameter Provisioning

4.2 Reference model
-------------------

The T8 reference point resides between the SCEF and the SCS/AS as
depicted in figure 4.2.1. The overall SCEF architecture is depicted in
subclause 4.2 of 3GPP TS 23.682 \[2\].

NOTE: The SCS/AS can be provided by a third party.

Figure 4.2.1: T8 reference model

4.3 Functional elements
-----------------------

### 4.3.1 SCEF

The SCEF is a functional element which provides means to securely expose
the services and capabilities provided by 3GPP network interfaces. The
SCEF provides access to network capabilities through homogenous
application programming interfaces.

Individual instances of SCEF may vary depending on what service
capabilities are exposed and what API features are supported.

The SCEF shall protect the other PLMN entities (e.g. HSS, MME) from
requests exceeding the permission arranged in the SLA with the
third-party service provider.

When needed, the SCEF supports mapping between information exchanged
with SCS/AS (e.g. geographical identifiers) and information exchanged
with internal PLMN functions (e.g. cell-Id, eNB-Id, TAI, MBMS SAI,
etc.). This mapping is assumed to be provided by the SCEF based on local
configuration data.

### 4.3.2 SCS/AS

The SCS is the entity which connects MTC application servers to the 3GPP
network to enable them to communicate through specific 3GPP defined
services with UEs used for MTC and with the SCEF in the HPLMN. The SCS
offers capabilities for use by one or multiple MTC application servers.
The MTC applications in the external network are hosted on one or more
ASs.

An SCS/AS can get services from multiple SCEFs, and an SCEF can provide
services to multiple SCS/ASs.

The SCS is controlled by the operator of the HPLMN or by a MTC Service
Provider.

The AS can be controlled by a 3^rd^ party.

4.4 Procedures over T8 reference point
--------------------------------------

### 4.4.1 Introduction

All procedures that operate across the T8 reference point, as specified
in 3GPP TS 23.682 \[2\], are specified in the following subclauses.

### 4.4.2 Monitoring Procedures

#### 4.4.2.1 General

These procedures are used to perform event monitoring functions via the
T8 interface, which include:

\- Monitoring event configuration as specified in subclause 4.4.2.2;

\- Reporting of monitoring event as specified in subclause 4.4.2.3;

\- Network initiated notifications of monitoring event cancellation, as
specified in subclause 4.4.2.4 ; and

\- Network initiated notifications of applied parameter configuration,
as specified in subclause 4.4.2.5.

#### 4.4.2.2 Monitoring Events Configuration

##### 4.4.2.2.1 General

In order to subscribe to a new monitoring event configuration, the
SCS/AS shall send an HTTP POST message to the SCEF targeting the
resource \"Monitoring Event Subscriptions\". The body of the HTTP POST
message shall include:

\- SCS/AS Identifier;

\- Monitoring Type;

\- Notification Destination Address; and

\- One of External Identifier, MSISDN or External Group Identifier. The
External Identifier or the MSISDN identifies the subscription of an
individual UE and the External Group Identifier points to a group of
UEs.

\- In addition, the HTTP POST request may include:

\- Maximum Number of Reports;

\- Monitoring Duration indicated by the property \"monitorExpireTime\";

\- Group Reporting Guard Time.

If the Subscription\_modification feature is supported, the SCS/AS may
send an HTTP PUT message in order to update an existing monitoring event
subscription. The HTTP PUT request targets the resource \"Individual
Monitoring Event Subscription\" replacing all properties in the existing
configuration.

For one-time monitoring type of requests, the SCS/AS shall include the
Maximum Number of Reports with a value set to 1 and not include the
Monitoring Duration in the HTTP request message sent to the SCEF.

Upon receipt of the HTTP POST or PUT request message, if the SCS/AS is
authorized to perform such request, the SCEF shall check whether the
parameters (e.g. Maximum Number of Reports, Monitoring Duration, Maximum
Latency, Maximum Response Time, Suggested number of downlink packets) in
the HTTP request body are within the range defined by operator policies.
If one or more of these parameters are not within the range, the SCEF
shall:

\- either reject the request message by sending an HTTP response to the
SCS/AS with a status code set to 403 Forbidden and may include the
\"PARAMETER\_OUT\_OF\_RANGE\" error in the \"cause\" attribute of the
\"ProblemDetails\" structure and indicate which parameters are out of
the range in the \"invalidParams\" attribute of the \"ProblemDetails\"
structure; or

\- modify the parameters which are not within the range by selecting
different values which are in the range.

For individual UE configuration requests, the SCEF shall also check
whether the Idle Status Indication is included for UE reachability
event. If the Idle Status Indication is received in the request but not
supported by the network, the SCEF may reject the request message by
sending an HTTP response to the SCS/AS with a status code set to 403
Forbidden and may include the \"IDLE\_STATUS\_UNSUPPORTED\" error in the
\"cause\" attribute of the \"ProblemDetails\" structure.

If the SCEF receives an HTTP POST request to create a subscription
resource for a monitoring event, but without an indication of the
support for the feature corresponding to the requested monitoring event,
the SCEF shall reject the request by sending a \"400 Bad Request\" HTTP
error response with the application error \"EVENT\_FEATURE\_MISMATCH\".

If the SCEF receives an HTTP POST request to create a subscription
resource for a monitoring event that it does not support, the SCEF shall
reject the request by sending a \"500 Internal Server Error\" HTTP error
response with the application error \"EVENT\_UNSUPPORTED\".

After validation, the SCEF shall store the parameters and

\- may assign an SCEF Reference ID related to the created monitoring
event subscription resource; and based on operator policies, shall

\- map the accuracy into permissible granularity for location reporting
event;

\- map the location area into a list of cells, eNodeB(s) and/or
RAI(s)/TAI(s) and derive the corresponding MME(s)/SGSN(s), for number of
UEs present in a geographic area event.

In order to delete a previous active configured monitoring event
subscription at the SCEF, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP DELETE message
to the SCEF targeting the resource \"Individual Monitoring Event
Subscription\" which is previously received in the response to the
request that has created the monitoring events subscription resource.
The SCEF shall detemine the SCEF Reference ID related to the active
monitoring subscription resource.

##### 4.4.2.2.2 Monitoring Events Configuration via HSS

###### 4.4.2.2.2.1 General

The following monitoring events are applicable for the monitoring event
configuration via HSS for an individual UE or a group of UEs:

\- Loss of connectivity;

\- UE reachability;

\- Location Reporting;

\- Change of IMSI-IMEI(SV) Association;

\- Roaming Status;

\- Communication Failure;

\- PDN connectivity status;

\- Availability after DDN Failure; and

\- API support capability.

Only one-time reporting is supported if the \"reachabilityType\"
attribute sets to \"SMS\" for the event \"UE reachability\" or if the
\"locationType\" attribute sets to \"LAST\_KNOWN\_LOCATION\" for the
event \"Location Reporting\" in the monitoring event request.

###### 4.4.2.2.2.2 Configuration Request for an individual UE

Upon receipt of a configuration request from the SCS/AS for an
individual UE, the SCEF shall interact with the HSS via S6t, as
specified in 3GPP TS 29.336 \[11\].

Upon receipt of a successful response from the HSS,

\- if it is a one-time monitoring request and the monitoring event
report is received, the SCEF shall delete the associated configuration,
send an HTTP response message to the SCS/AS with a \"200 OK\" status
code and including the received monitoring event report.

\- otherwise, the SCEF shall,

\- for an HTTP POST request, create a new \"Individual Monitoring Event
Subscription\" resource addressed by the URI that contains the SCS/AS
identifier and an SCEF-created subscription identifier, and send an HTTP
response to the SCS/AS with a \"201 Created\" status code, containing
the final suggested configuration parameter(s) (if modified),
indication(s) of the discarded parameter(s) (if discarded), the
monitoring event report, if received, and a location header field
containing the URI of the created resource.

\- for an HTTP PUT request, update the active \"Individual Monitoring
Event Subscription\" resource addressed by the request URI and send an
HTTP response to the SCS/AS with a \"200 OK\" status code, containing
the final suggested configuration parameter(s) (if modified),
indication(s) of the discarded parameter(s) (if discarded) and the
monitoring event report, if received.

\- for an HTTP DELETE request, delete the active \"Individual Monitoring
Event Subscription\" resource addressed by the request URI and send an
HTTP response to the SCS/AS with a \"204 No Content\" status code, or a
\"200 OK\" status code and including the monitoring event report, if
received.

If the SCEF receives a response with an error code from the HSS, the
SCEF shall not create, update nor delete the concerned resource and
respond to the SCS/AS with a corresponding failure code as described in
subclause 5.2.6.

###### 4.4.2.2.2.3 Configuration Request for a group of UEs

Upon receipt of a request from the SCS/AS including an External Group
Identifier, then the monitoring configuration is for a group of UEs. The
SCEF shall interact with the HSS via S6t as specified in
3GPP TS 29.336 \[11\].

Upon receipt of a successful response from the HSS indicating that group
processing is in progress and before beginning the processing of
individual UEs, the SCEF shall,

\- for an HTTP POST request, create a new \"Individual Monitoring Event
Subscription\" resource addressed by a URI that contains the SCS/AS
identity and an SCEF-created subscription identifier, store the number
of UEs received in the response message from the HSS within the resource
and send an HTTP response to the SCS/AS with \"201 Created\" status code
and a location header field containing the URI of the created resource,
in order to acknowledge the SCS/AS of the successful group processing
request.

\- for an HTTP PUT request, update the active \"Individual Monitoring
Event Subscription\" resource addressed by the request URL and send an
HTTP response with \"200 OK\" status code to acknowledge the SCS/AS of
the successful group processing request.

\- for an HTTP DELETE request, delete the active \"Individual Monitoring
Event Subscription\" resource addressed by the request URI and send an
HTTP response to the SCS/AS with \"204 No Content\" status code.

If the SCEF receives a response with an error code from the HSS, the
SCEF shall not create, update nor delete the concerned resource and
respond to the SCS/AS with a corresponding failure code as described in
subclause 5.2.6.

Upon receipt of the processing result of the individual UEs from the
HSS, the SCEF shall behave as follows:

\- if no Group Reporting Guard Time is received, the SCEF shall send an
HTTP POST request message to the SCS/AS including a reference to the
related monitoring subscription, a list of configuration failure result
if received for the group members, and the \"monitoringEventReports\"
attribute including a list of monitoring event reports if received for
the group members;

\- otherwise, the SCEF shall accumulate all of the configuration results
and/or monitoring event reports received from the HSS for the group
members until the Group Reporting Guard Time expires. Then the SCEF
shall send an HTTP POST request message to the SCS/AS including a
reference to the related monitoring subscription, and a list of
configuration failure result if received for the group members, and the
\"monitoringEventReports\" attribute including a list of monitoring
event reports at the Group Reporting Guard Time.

The SCS/AS shall send an HTTP response to acknowledge the SCEF about the
handling result of the received HTTP POST request.

##### 4.4.2.2.3 Monitoring Events Configuration directly via MME/SGSN

The monitoring event \"Number of UEs in a geographic area\" is
applicable for the monitoring event configuration via MME/SGSN. Only
one-time reporting is supported for this event with the value of Maximum
Number of Reports indicated by \"maximumNumberOfReports\" set to 1.

Upon receipt of an HTTP POST request from the SCS/AS, the SCEF shall

\- resolve the location area to the involved SGSN(s)/MME(s) by local
configuration;

\- interact with the HSS via the S6t interface as specified in
3GPP TS 29.336 \[11\] if the External Group ID(s) is included; and

\- interact with the SGSN(s)/MME(s) via the T6a/b inteface as specified
in 3GPP TS 29.128 \[12\].

NOTE: The SCEF uses local configuration to resolve the involved
SGSN(s)/MME(s) if the location area is not received.

After collecting responses from the SGSN(s)/MME(s), if the SCEF does not
receive any successful response from the involved SGSN(s)/MME(s), the
SCEF shall respond to the SCS/AS with a corresponding failure code as
described in subclause 5.2.6; otherwise the SCEF should send a response
with 200 OK status code to acknowledge the SCS/AS with one aggregated
report in the requested area by including the total count of the number
of UEs in the \"ueCount\" attribute and the External Identifier(s) (if
available) or the MSISDN(s) (if available) associated with the External
Group ID.

NOTE: It is possible that the number of UEs does not reflect the actual
number of UEs in the designated area (e.g. some SGSN(s)/MME(s) do not
respond successfully). The SCEF still provides the result to the SCS/AS
if at least one SGSN/MME returns a successful response.

##### 4.4.2.2.4 Monitoring Events Configuration via PCRF

###### 4.4.2.2.4.1 General

The following monitoring events: the location reporting event and
communication failure event are applicable for the monitoring event
configuration via PCRF for an individual UE.

If monitoring event configuration via PCRF is used for a subscription
resource, the Subscription\_modification feature cannot be supported.

Only the location reporting event is applicabe for the monitoring event
configuration via PCRF for a group of UEs.

Only one-time reporting is supported for the monitoring event
configuration via PCRF.

HTTP PUT is not supported for the monitoring event configuration via
PCRF. If it is received, the SCEF shall reject the HTTP PUT message with
403 Forbidden during monitoring and may indicate the
\"OPERATION\_PROHIBITED\" error in the \"cause\" attribute of the
\"ProblemDetails\" structure.

###### 4.4.2.2.4.2 Configuration Request for an individual UE

Upon receipt of an HTTP POST request from the SCS/AS for an individual
UE, the SCEF shall:

\- interact with the PCRF via the Rx inteface by using an existing AF
session or establishing a new AF session as specified in
3GPP TS 29.214 \[10\];

NOTE 1: The SCEF can derive the service information over the Rx
interface based on SCS/AS ID for communication failure event.

\- after receiving the AAA message from the PCRF, create a resource
which represents the monitoring event configuration addressed by a URI
that contains the SCS/AS identifier and an SCEF-created subscription
identifier; and

\- send a corresponding status code to acknowledge the SCS/AS of the
successful processing of the request in the HTTP response message.

Then the SCEF shall wait for the reporting from the PCRF as specified in
3GPP TS 29.214 \[10\].

NOTE 2: Different events can be reported in different messages according
to 3GPP TS 29.214 \[10\], e.g. STR/RAR for communication failure.

During configuration resource deletion, the SCEF shall also terminate
the AF session if it was established and used only for event monitoring.

###### 4.4.2.2.4.3 Configuration Request for a group of UEs

Upon receipt of an HTTP POST request from the SCS/AS for a group of UEs,
the SCEF shall:

\- interact with all PCRFs in the same PLMN via Nta application of Nt
interface as specified in 3GPP TS 29.154 \[9\];

\- after collecting ECA message from all PCRFs, create a resource which
represents the monitoring event configuration addressed by a URI that
contains the SCS/AS identifier and an SCEF-created subscription
identifier; and

\- send a corresponding status code to acknowledge the SCS/AS of the
successful processing of the request in the HTTP response message.

Then the SCEF shall wait for the reporting from the PCRF(s) as specified
in 3GPP TS 29.154 \[9\].

#### 4.4.2.3 Reporting of Monitoring Event Procedure

Upon receipt of a Monitoring Event Report from the HSS or the MME/SGSN
as defined in subclause 5.6.3 or subclause 5.6.8 of
3GPP TS 23.682 \[2\], from the PCRF as defined in subclause 5.6.5 or
from the IWK-SCEF as defined in subclause 5.6.8 of 3GPP TS 23.682 \[2\],
the SCEF shall determine the monitoring event subscription associated
with the corresponding Monitoring Event Report.

If the monitoring event subscription refers to a Monitoring Event
Configuration for a single UE or to a group-based Monitoring Event
configuration, and no Group Reporting Guard Time was set, then the SCEF
shall send an HTTP POST message including a link to the SCEF-created
subscription resource and the received Monitoring Event Report to the
identified destination. If the monitoring event subscription refers to a
group-based Monitoring Event Configuration and Group Reporting Guard
Time was provided during the Monitoring Event configuration procedure,
then the SCEF shall accumulate all of the received Monitoring Event
reports for the group of UEs until the Group Reporting Guard Time
expires or the monitoring duration indicated by the property
\"monitorExpireTime\" is reached.

Upon expiration of Group Reporting Guard Time or expiration of the
monitoring duration, the SCEF shall send an HTTP POST message to the
identified destination including a link to the SCEF-created subscription
resource and the list of accumulated Monitoring Event Reports for each
UE identified by either its External Identifier or MSISDN. The
destination URL of the HTTP POST message is provided by the SCS/AS
during the Monitoring Event Configuration procedure.

If the monitoring event subscription refers to a one-time monitoring
request or a continuous monitoring request, but the maximum number of
reports is reached, the SCEF shall consider the reporting as completed
and delete the corresponding \"Individual Monitoring Event
Subscription\" resource. In addition, the SCEF shall interact with the
HSS to delete the event configuration if the latter was performed via
the HSS whereas event reports were performed via the SGSN/MME. The SCEF
determines that the reporting for a group is completed by comparing the
total number of received reports with the number of UEs of the group
(received from the HSS during event configuration for a group of UEs)
multiplied by the maximum number of reports.

When the monitoring duration indicated by the property
\"monitorExpireTime\" is reached, the SCEF shall delete the related
event subscription and event configuration locally. The SCS/AS shall no
longer address the corresponding \"Individual Monitoring Event
Subscription\" resource.

#### 4.4.2.4 Network-initiated Explicit Monitoring Event Deletion Procedure

Upon receipt of an identifier for the event to be deleted from the HSS
as defined in 3GPP TS 29.336 \[11\], the SCEF shall determine the
subscription identifier associated with the indicated active monitoring
subscription. Then the SCEF shall delete the related resource
\"Individual Monitoring Event Subscription\", send an HTTP POST message
including the subscription identifier and a cancellation indication to
the identified destination. The cancellation indication shall set to
\"true\" indicating to cancel the configured monitoring subscription.
The destination URL of the HTTP POST is provided by the SCS/AS during
the Monitoring Event Configuration procedure.

NOTE: The above procedure can be triggered from the HSS due to parameter
overwritten by Network Parameter Configuration.

#### 4.4.2.5 Network initiated notification of applied parameter configuration

For \"LOSS\_OF\_CONNECTIVITY\" and \"UE\_REACHABILITY\" events, if the
\"Enhanced\_param\_config\" feature is supported and the SCEF receives
the currently applied parameter configuration from the HSS, the SCEF
shall notify the SCS/AS via an HTTP POST message including the parameter
changes in the \"appliedParam\" attribute.

### 4.4.3 Procedures for resource management of Background Data Transfer

These procedures are used by an SCS/AS to perform the resource
management of background data transfer (BDT) to a set of UEs, i.e. the
SCS/AS requests a time window and related conditions from the SCEF via
the T8 interface.

In order to create a resource for the background data transfer policy,
the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP POST message to the SCEF for the \"BDT
Subscriptions\" resource to negotiate the transfer policy. The body of
the HTTP POST message shall include SCS/AS Identifier, Volume per UE
(total volume for both DL and UL or separate volume for DL and/or UL),
Number of UEs, Desired Time Window and optionally a location area
information.

After receiving the HTTP POST message, if the SCS/AS is authorized, the
SCEF shall map the SCS/AS Identifier to ASP Identifier and negotiate the
transfer policy with the PCRF as defined in 3GPP TS 29.154 \[9\]. After
receiving the response including the determined transfer policies from
the PCRF, the SCEF shall create a resource \"Individual BDT
Subscription\" which represents the BDT subscription, addressed by a URI
that contains the SCS/AS identifier and an SCEF-created subscription
identifier, and shall respond to the SCS/AS with a 201 Created message,
including a Location header field containing the URI for the created
resource and a message body, which may also include Reference ID and a
set of transfer policies. The SCS/AS shall use the URI received in the
Location header in subsequent requests to the SCEF to refer to this
background data transfer subscription. If the SCEF receives a response
with an error code from the PCRF, the SCEF shall not create the resource
and shall respond to the SCS/AS with a corresponding failure code as
described in subclause 5.2.6.

The SCS/AS may also send an HTTP PUT message to the SCEF for the
\"Individual BDT Subscription\" resource to request starting an update
for negotiation of background data transfer policy. The body of the HTTP
PUT message shall include data as described in the POST message. The
external group identifier shall remain unchanged from previously
provided value. After receiving such request, if the SCS/AS is
authorized, the SCEF shall negotiate the transfer policy with the PCRF
as defined in 3GPP TS 29.154 \[9\]. After receiving the response
including the determined transfer policies from the PCRF, the SCEF shall
send an HTTP response to the SCS/AS with a corresponding status code and
may include Reference ID and a set of transfer policies. If the SCEF
receives a response with an error code from the PCRF, the SCEF shall not
update the resource and shall respond to the SCS/AS with a corresponding
failure code as described in subclause 5.2.6.

NOTE 1: The SCEF starts a new BDT policy negotiation in the Nt interface
by sending the request to the PCRF without the previously associated BDT
Reference ID.

If more than one policy is included in the HTTP response, the SCS/AS
shall send an HTTP PATCH message to inform the SCEF for the \"Individual
BDT Subscription\" resource of the transfer policy selected by the
SCS/AS. After receiving the HTTP PATCH message, the SCEF shall send an
HTTP response to the SCS/AS with a corresponding status code and
interact with the PCRF as defined in 3GPP TS 29.154 \[9\]. If the SCEF
identifies any error (e.g. selected policy is not within the set of
transfer policies), the SCEF shall not update the resource and shall
respond to the SCS/AS with a corresponding failure code as described in
subclause 5.2.6.

The SCS/AS may also send an HTTP DELETE message to the SCEF for the
\"Individual BDT Subscription\" resource requesting to remove an
individual resource identified by the URI received in the response to
the request that has created resource a URI. After receiving such
request, the SCEF shall delete the resource and send an HTTP response to
the SCS/AS with a corresponding status code.

NOTE 2: The SCEF can also remove the resource when the last window end
time in transfer policies expires.

### 4.4.4 Procedures for changing the chargeable party at session set up or during the session

This procedure is used by an SCS/AS to either request to sponsor the
traffic from the beginning or to request becoming the chargeable party
at a later point in time via the T8 interface.

When setting up the connection between the AS and the UE via the SCEF,
the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP POST request to the SCEF, targeting the
\"Chargeable Party Transactions\" resource, to become the chargeable
party for the session to be set up. The body of the HTTP POST message
shall include the SCS/AS Identifier, UE IP address, IP Flow description,
Sponsor ID, ASP ID, Sponsoring Status, notification destination URI
identifying the recipient of notifications within the
\"notificationDestination\" attribute and may include the time period
and/or traffic volume used for sponsoring. The SCS/AS may also request
to activate a previously selected policy of background data transfer by
including the associated Reference ID in the body of the HTTP POST
message.

After receiving the HTTP POST request, if the authorization performed by
the SCEF is successful, the SCEF shall act as an AF and interact with
the PCRF via the Rx interface, as defined in 3GPP TS 29.214 \[10\] or
3GPP TS 29.201 \[13\], to trigger a PCRF initiated IP-CAN Session
Modification. The SCEF may map the SCS/AS Identifier to AF Application
Identifier and may request to be notified about the traffic plane
status. If the time period and/or traffic volume are received from the
AF, the SCEF should subscribe with the PCRF to the USAGE\_REPORT event.

NOTE 1: In this release of current specification, the SCS/AS Identifier
can only be mapped to one AF Application Identifier based on operator
policy and/or local configuration in the SCEF.

After receiving a successful response from the PCRF, the SCEF shall
create a new \"Individual Chargeable Party Transaction\" resource, which
represents the chargeable party transaction, addressed by a URI that
contains the SCS/AS identity and an SCEF-created transaction identifier,
and shall respond to the SCS/AS with a 201 Created status code,
including a Location header field containing the URI of the created
resource. The SCS/AS shall use the URI received in the Location header
in subsequent requests to the SCEF to refer to this chargeable party
transaction. If the SCEF receives a response with an error code from the
PCRF, the SCEF shall not create a resource and respond to the SCS/AS
with a corresponding failure code as described in subclause 5.2.6.

In order to update the sponsoring status of an established AS session,
the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP PATCH message to the SCEF targeting the
associated \"Individual Chargeable Party Transaction\" resource
requesting to partial update a chargeable party transaction resource
(e.g. change the Sponsoring Status). When receiving the HTTP PATCH
message, the SCEF shall make the change and interact with the PCRF to
modify the Rx session as defined in 3GPP TS 29.214 \[10\] or
3GPP TS 29.201 \[13\]. After receiving a response with successful result
code from the PCRF, the SCEF shall send an HTTP response to the SCS/AS
with a 200 OK status code and the result in the body of the HTTP
response. The accumulated usage received from the PCRF shall be included
if the SCS/AS requested to disable the sponsoring. If the SCEF receives
a response with an error code from the PCRF, the SCEF shall not update
the resource and respond to the SCS/AS with a corresponding failure code
as described in subclause 5.2.6.

If the SCEF receives a traffic plane notification (e.g. the usage
threshold is reached or transmission resource lost) or gets informed
that the Rx session is terminated (e.g. due to the release of PDN
connection), the SCEF shall send an HTTP POST message including the
notified event (e.g. session terminated) and the accumulated usage to
the SCS/AS identified by the notification destination URI received
during session set up. The SCS/AS shall respond with an HTTP response to
confirm the received notification.

NOTE 2: The SCS/AS can assume a successful resource allocation upon
receipt of the POST/PATCH response until the
FAILED\_RESOURCES\_ALLOCATION event is received.

In order to remove an established AS session, the SCS/AS shall send an
HTTP DELETE message to the SCEF targeting the associated \"Individual
Chargeable Party Transaction\" resource. After receiving the HTTP DELETE
message, the SCEF shall remove all properties of the resource and
interact with the PCRF to terminate the Rx session (as defined in
3GPP TS 29.214 \[10\] or 3GPP TS 29.201 \[13\]). After receiving the
response from the PCRF, the SCEF shall send an HTTP response to the
SCS/AS with a corresponding status code and the accumulated usage (if
received from the PCRF).

### 4.4.5 Procedures for Non-IP Data Delivery

#### 4.4.5.1 General

This procedure is used by an SCS/AS to support the Non-IP Data Delivery
(NIDD) via SCEF. It performs the NIDD configuration via the T8
interface. It also includes the mobile terminated (MT) and mobile
originated (MO) communication with UEs via the T8 interface. It also
includes the group message delivery via MT NIDD via the T8 interface and
management of port numbers on UE and SCEF and their dynamic association
with different applications.

Error handling for the procedures in this subclause shall be handled
based on subclause 5.2.6.

#### 4.4.5.2 NIDD Configuration

##### 4.4.5.2.1 NIDD Configuration for a single UE

For a NIDD configuration creation, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP POST
message to the SCEF for the \"NIDD configurations\" resource. The body
of the HTTP POST message shall include External Identifier or MSISDN,
SCS/AS Identifier, notification destination URI identifying the
recipient of notification within the \"notificationDestination\"
attribute and may include NIDD Duration, PDN Connection Establishment
Option and Reliable Data Service Configuration. In addition, the SCS/AS
may send non-IP data and its associated parameters (e.g. Priority) as
described in subsclause 4.4.5.3.1 in the NIDD configuration creation
request. The Reliable Data Service Configuration includes port numbers
on UE and SCEF that are used to identify specific applications for data
transfer between UE and SCS/AS and an indication if reliable data
service acknowledgement is enabled or not.

Upon receipt of the HTTP POST request from the SCS/AS to create a NIDD
configuration, the SCEF shall check whether the SCS/AS is authenticated
and authorized to create NIDD configuration, and also authorize the NIDD
configuration. If authorization is successful, the SCEF shall interact
with the HSS via S6t as specified in 3GPP TS 29.336 \[11\]. Upon receipt
of the successful response from the HSS, the SCEF shall store the UE
identity (IMSI and External Identifier or MSISDN) which is associated
with the External Identifier or MSISDN and create a resource
\"Individual NIDD configuration\", which represents the NIDD
configuration, addressed by a URI that contains the SCS/AS identity and
an SCEF-created NIDD configuration identifier, and shall respond to the
SCS/AS with a 201 Created message, including a Location header field
containing the URI for the created resource. The body of the response
message shall include Maximum Packet Size and may include Reliable Data
Service Indication. When the SCS/AS receives the URI in the Location
header, it shall use this URI in subsequent requests to the SCEF to
refer to this NIDD configuration.

If the SCS/AS includes an downlink non-IP data together with the NIDD
configuration creation, the SCEF shall also create an \"Individual NIDD
downlink data delivery\" sub-resource and send each of the sub-resouce
within the \"self\" attribute in the \"niddDownlinkDataTransfers\"
attribute together with the created resource \"Individual NIDD
configuration\" which included in the Location header field in the HTTP
POST response. When the SCS/AS receives the URI the \"self\" attribute
in the \"niddDownlinkDataTransfers\" attribute, it shall use this URI in
subsequent requests to the SCEF to refer to this downlink data delivery
transfer.

After sending the HTTP response to NIDD configuration request, the SCEF
shall perform the procedure for individual MT NIDD as described in
subclause 4.4.5.3.1.

NOTE: Any further interaction with the SCS/AS for the piggybacked
individual MT NIDD is performed by the notification of NIDD downlink
data delivery status.

For a NIDD configuration modification, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP
PATCH message to the SCEF for the \"Individual NIDD configuration\"
resource, using the URI received in the response to the request that has
created the NIDD configuration resource. Upon receipt of the HTTP PATCH
request from the SCS/AS to update the parameters of the NIDD
configuration, the SCEF shall check whether the SCS/AS is authenticated
and authorized to update NIDD configuration. If the authorization is
successful, the SCEF shall verify that the resource to be modified
already exists as identified by the URI. If the NIDD configuration
resource is found, the SCEF shall update the NIDD configuration as
requested. Upon successful update of the requested NIDD configuration
including the interaction with the HSS via S6t as specified in
3GPP TS 29.336 \[11\], the SCEF shall respond to the SCS/AS with a 200
OK success message indicating that the NIDD configuration resource was
successfully updated, or with a 204 No Content success message if the
NIDD configuration modification is successful updated with no content in
the PATCH response message body.

For a NIDD configuration cancellation, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP
DELETE message to the SCEF for the \"Individual NIDD configuration\"
resource, using the URI received in the response to the request that has
created the NIDD configuration resource. Upon receipt of the HTTP DELETE
message from the SCS/AS, the SCEF shall check whether the SCS/AS is
authenticated and authorized to delete NIDD configuration. If the
authorization is successful, the SCEF shall verify that the NIDD
configuration resource identified by the URI already exists. If the
configuration resource exists, the SCEF shall delete the requested
configuration, and perform related NIDD procedure to EPC network
elements if applicable. Upon successful deletion of requested NIDD
configuration, the SCEF shall respond to the SCS/AS with a 200 OK
success message indicating that the NIDD configuration was successfully
cancelled. As an alternative to the 200 OK success message, the SCEF may
send a 204 No Content success message without any message content to the
SCS/AS.

When the NIDD Duration expires, the SCEF may remove the associated NIDD
configuration resource and all individual downlink data delivery
resources under such NIDD configuration.

##### 4.4.5.2.2 NIDD Configuration for a group of UEs

The NIDD configuration procedure for a single UE as described in
subclause 4.4.5.2.1 shall be applicable for a group of UEs with the
following differences:

\- The External Group Identifier shall be included in the POST request
instead of MSISDN or External Identifier.

\- After receiving the response message from the HSS, the SCEF shall
store the list of UE identifiers (IMSI and External Identifier or
MSISDN) which are associated with the External Group Identifier.

\- The downlink non-IP data is not supported to be handled together with
the NIDD configuration.

#### 4.4.5.3 Mobile Terminated NIDD procedure

##### 4.4.5.3.1 Mobile Terminated NIDD for a single UE

If the SCS/AS needs to perform a downlink non-IP data delivery for a
single UE, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP POST message to the SCEF for
the \"NIDD downlink data deliveries\" resource, identifying an existing
NIDD configuration resource as parent resource. The body of the HTTP
POST message shall include External Identifier or MSISDN and non-IP data
and may include PDN Connection Establishment Option, Reliable Data
Service Configuration, Maximum Latency and Priority. The Reliable Data
Service Configuration includes port numbers on UE and SCEF that are used
to identify a specific application for data transfer between UE and
SCS/AS and an indication if reliable data service acknowledgement is
enabled or not.

Upon receipt of a HTTP POST request from the SCS/AS for a downlink data
delivery for a single UE, the SCEF shall:

> \- verify the NIDD configuration resource already exists based on the
> URI passed, if the configuration resource does not exist, the SCEF
> shall respond a 404 Not Found response to reject the downlink data
> delivery, and
>
> \- check whether the SCS/AS is authorised to send NIDD requests, if
> not authorized, the SCEF shall respond a 401 Unauthorized response to
> reject the downlink data delivery, and
>
> \- check whether the non-IP packet size is larger than the Maximum
> Packet Size that was provided to the SCS/AS during NIDD Configuration.
> If the packet is oversized, the SCEF shall respond a 403 Forbidden
> response with a cause value \"DATA\_TOO\_LARGE\" in the \"cause\"
> attribute of the \"ProblemDetails\" structure indicating received
> non-IP packet size is larger than \"maximumPacketSize\" of the NIDD
> configuration.
>
> \- if the Rds\_port\_verification feature is supported, check whether
> the RDS port numbers are within the configured RDS port list. If the
> RDS port numbers are unknown in the SCEF, the SCEF shall respond a 403
> Forbidden response with a cause value \"RDS\_PORT\_UNKNOWN\" in the
> \"cause\" attribute of the \"ProblemDetails\" structure.

If all above checks are successful, the SCEF shall determine the EPS
Bearer Context based on the APN associated with the NIDD configuration
and the User Identity. If the SCEF EPS bearer context is not found in
the SCEF, depending on PDN Connection Establishment Option received in
the POST request or from NIDD configuration, the SCEF may:

\- reject the request with an error message to the SCS/AS;

\- send a Device Trigger to the UE as described in subclause 4.4.6
without buffering the non-IP data and respond the SCS/AS with a 500
Internal Server Error response; or

\- buffer the non-IP data and create the \"Individual NIDD downlink data
delivery\" sub-resource, then send a 201 Created response to the SCS/AS.
The response message also includes an indication of whether the Device
Trigger procedure (as described in subclause 4.4.6) was performed by the
SCEF. A Location header shall be included in the response message that
provides the URI of the resource identifying this individual downlink
data delivery. The SCS/AS shall use the URI received in the Location
header in subsequent requests to the SCEF to refer to this individual
downlink data delivery for possible replacement or cancellation. The
non-IP data shall be delivered when the non-IP PDN connection is
established.

If the SCEF EPS bearer context is found in the SCEF, the SCEF shall
check if the SCS/AS has exceeded the quota or rate of data submission
considering the number of existing buffered non-IP data and restriction
in APN and serving PLMN rate control. If quota is reached, the SCEF
shall respond the SCS/AS with a 403 Forbidden response and a cause value
\"QUOTA\_EXCEEDED\" in the \"cause\" attribute of the \"ProblemDetails\"
structure indicating the reason for the failure condition. If rate limit
is reached, the SCEF shall respond the SCS/AS with 429 Too Many
Requests.

If the check is passed, the SCEF shall continue the downlink non-IP data
delivery procedure as the defined 3GPP TS 29.128 \[12\].

If the non-IP data delivery was successful, the SCEF shall send a 200 OK
response to the HTTP POST request indicating the downlink non-IP data
delivery is successful along with the acknowledge information; otherwise
the SCEF may:

\- send a 500 Internal Server Error and a cause value indicating the
reason for the delivery failure; or

\- if the MME/SGSN indicates UE is temporary not reachable, either:

1\. buffer the non-IP data and and create the \"Individual NIDD downlink
data delivery\" sub-resource, then send a 201 Created response to the
SCS/AS. The response may include a Requested Re-Transmission time to
indicate the SCS/AS when the UE is expected to be reachable so that the
SCEF re-transmits the buffered non-IP data; or

2\. send a 500 Internal Server Error response without buffering the
non-IP data, and include a cause value \"TEMPORARILY\_NOT\_REACHABLE\"
in the \"cause\" attribute of the \"ProblemDetails\" structure
indicating the downlink non-IP data delivery is perfomed but stopped
since UE is temporarily unreachable. The response may include a
Requested Re-Transmission time to indicate the SCS/AS when the UE is
expected to be reachable so that the SCS/AS may prepare any
re-transmission;

If the MT\_NIDD\_modification\_cancellation feature is supported and the
SCS/AS decides to replace the pending downlink data delivery in the
SCEF, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP PUT message to the SCEF, using the
URI received in the response to the request that has created the
individual downlink data delivery resource. The External Identifier or
MSISDN shall remain unchanged from previous values. Upon receipt of the
HTTP PUT request from the SCS/AS, the SCEF shall check whether a pending
non-IP data exists with the same URI (i.e. resource exists). If it is
found, the SCEF shall replace it with the new non-IP data and continue
waiting for any message from the MME/SGSN for the UE indicating either
the non-IP PDN connection is being established or the UE is reachable
(such message may be an MO NIDD); otherwise the SCEF shall respond 409
Conflict with a cause value \"SENDING\" in the \"cause\" attribute of
the \"ProblemDetails\" structure indicating replacement failure. If the
buffered data is already delivered, the SCEF shall respond with 404 Not
Found and include a cause value a cause value \"ALREADY\_DELIVERED\" in
the \"cause\" attribute of the \"ProblemDetails\" structure indicating
replacement failure.

If the MT\_NIDD\_modification\_cancellation feature is supported and the
SCS/AS decides to cancel the pending downlink data delivery in the SCEF,
the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP DELETE message to the SCEF, using the URI
received in the response to the request that has created the individual
downlink data delivery resource. Upon receipt of the HTTP DELETE request
from the SCS/AS, the SCEF shall check whether a pending request exists
with the same URI. If such non-IP data has not been delivered, the SCEF
shall remove the individual downlink data delivery resource and respond
with an HTTP 204 No Content response; otherwise the SCEF shall respond
with 404 Not Found (i.e. data already delivered) with a cause value
\"ALREADY\_DELIVERED\" in the \"cause\" attribute of the
\"ProblemDetails\" structure or 409 Conflict (i.e. data delivery
ongoing) response with a cause value \"SENDING\" in the \"cause\"
attribute of the \"ProblemDetails\" structure, and include a cause value
indicating cancellation failure.

If a pending non-IP data is delivered by the SCEF (e.g. due to non-IP
PDN connection establishment), and the SCEF gets the delivery result
from the MME/SGSN, the SCEF shall remove the \"Individual NIDD downlink
data delivery\" sub-resource and send an HTTP POST message to the
SCS/AS, identified by the notification destination URI received during
the NIDD configuration, to notify the delivery result for the pending
non-IP data. Upon receipt of the request, the SCS/AS shall acknowledge
the notification with an HTTP 200 OK or 204 No Content response.

During MT NIDD delivery, if the UE indicates no support for RDS and the
SCEF previously indicated RDS is enabled to the SCS/AS, the SCEF shall
stop sending the non-IP data and send MT NIDD delivery notification with
\"FAILURE\_RDS\_DISABLED\" delivery status.

##### 4.4.5.3.2 Mobile Terminated NIDD for a group of UEs

If the SCS/AS needs to perform a downlink non-IP data delivery to a
group of UEs and if both the SCS/AS and the SCEF support
GroupMesageDelivery feature as defined in sublcause 5.6.4, the SCS/AS
shall send an HTTP POST request message to the SCEF for the \"NIDD
downlink data deliveries\" resource, identifying an existing NIDD
configuration resource as parent resource. The body of the HTTP POST
request message shall include the External Group Identifier and the
non-IP data, and may include Reliable Data Service Configuration, PDN
Connection Establishment Option and Maximum Latency.

Upon receipt of such an HTTP POST request from the SCS/AS requesting the
group message delivery, the SCEF checks whether the SCS/AS is authorised
to send NIDD requests, whether the non-IP packet size is larger than the
Maximum Packet Size that was provided to the SCS/AS during NIDD
Configuration and if the Rds\_port\_verification feature is supported
whether the RDS port numbers are recognized. If any of those checks
fails, the SCEF shall respond a HTTP response with a cause value
indicating the reason for the failure condition. If all checks are
successful, the SCEF shall create an \"Individual NIDD downlink data
delivery\" resource and sends a 201 Created response to the SCS/AS to
acknowledge acceptance of the HTTP POST request.

Then for each authorized External Identifier associated to the External
Group Identifier which is retrieved from the HSS during preceding NIDD
configuration procedure (as specified in subclause 4.4.5.2.2), the SCEF
shall determine the EPS Bearer Context based on the APN associated with
the NIDD configuration and the User Identity and continue the procedure
as described for MT NIDD for a single UE in subclause 4.4.5.3.1 without
sending downlink data delivery status notification for any individual UE
to the SCS/AS.

At the end of buffering (duration determined by the Maximum Latency or
local policy) or after processing data delivery for all UEs in the
group, the SCEF shall send an HTTP POST message to SCS/AS to indicate
the aggregated result of data delivery of each UE. The body of the HTTP
POST request message shall include MSISDN or External Identifier,
Retransmission Time (optional) and delivery result for each UE. Upon
receipt of the request, the SCS/AS shall acknowledge the request with an
HTTP 200 OK or 204 No Content response.

The MT\_NIDD\_modification\_cancellation feature is not supported for
the group message delivery via NIDD. If a PUT or DELETE request is
received for the \"Individual NIDD downlink data delivery\" resource
which was created for a group of UEs, the SCEF shall reject the message
with 403 Forbidden response with a cause value \"OPERATION\_PROHIBITED\"
in the \"cause\" attribute of the \"ProblemDetails\" structure.

During MT NIDD delivery, if the UE indicates no support for RDS and the
SCEF previously indicated RDS is enabled to the SCS/AS, the SCEF shall
stop sending the non-IP data for the indicated UE. In the aggregated MT
NIDD delivery notification, the SCEF shall send
\"FAILURE\_RDS\_DISABLED\" delivery status for each failed UE.

#### 4.4.5.4 Mobile Originated NIDD procedure

When the SCEF receives the non-IP data from MME/SGSN (or IWK-SCEF) as
defined in 3GPP TS 29.128 \[12\], and finds an SCEF EPS bearer context
and the associated NIDD configuration, the SCEF shall determine the
SCS/AS by the corresponding NIDD configuration, and send an HTTP POST
request to the SCS/AS identified by the Notification Destination Address
received in the NIDD configuration to notify the uplink non-IP data. The
body of the HTTP POST message shall include External Identifier or
MSISDN, non-IP data, NIDD configuration identifier, Reliable Data
Service Configuration (if available). The Reliable Data Service
Configuration includes port numbers on UE and SCEF that are used to
identify a specific application for data transfer between UE and SCS/AS
and an indication if reliable data service acknowledgement is enabled or
not.

Upon receipt of the request, if the SCS/AS knows the NIDD configuration
identified by the NIDD configuration identifier, the SCS/AS shall
acknowledge a 200 OK or 204 No Content message to the SCEF.

#### 4.4.5.5 NIDD Authorisation Update procedure

When the SCEF receives a NIDD Authorisation Update Request message from
HSS to update a user\'s NIDD authorisation as defined in
3GPP TS 29.336 \[11\], the SCEF shall determine the SCS/AS with the
corresponding NIDD Configuration, and send an HTTP POST message to the
SCS/AS to notify it of the NIDD Authorisation Update. The body of the
HTTP POST message shall include External Identifier or MSISDN, NIDD
configuration identifier and the NIDD configuration status.

Upon receipt of the request, if the SCS/AS knows the corresponding NIDD
configuration, then the SCS/AS shall acknowledge the request with an
HTTP 200 OK or 204 No Content response.

If the NIDD configuration is revoked by the HSS within the received NIDD
Authorisation Update Request, the SCEF shall release the corresponding
T6a/b PDN connection as specified in 3GPP TS 29.128 \[12\]. In this
case, the SCEF shall reject any subsequent MT NIDD deliveries with a 403
Forbidden response. Or 404 Not Found is returned, if the SCEF locally
removed the associated NIDD configuration resource when the
configuration was revoked.

If the RDS capability is changed, e.g. when the T6a/b PDN connection is
etablished, the UE indicates no support for RDS but the SCEF previously
indicated RDS is supported to the SCS/AS in the NIDD configuration
procedure, the SCEF shall send an HTTP POST message to notify the SCS/AS
that the NIDD status is active and RDS capability indication. The SCS/AS
shall acknowledge the request with an HTTP 200 OK or 204 No Content
response.

If the Rds\_port\_verification feature is supported, before sending the
MO NIDD to the SCS/AS as specified in subclause 4.4.5.4, the SCEF shall
check RDS port numbers (decoded from the uplink non-IP data according to
3GPP TS 24.250 \[31\]). If the RDS port numbers are not within the
configured RDS port list, the SCEF shall notify the SCS/AS with NIDD
status set to \"RDS\_PORT\_UNKNOWN\" and the unknown RDS port numbers.
The SCS/AS shall acknowledge the request with an HTTP 200 OK or 204 No
Content response.

#### 4.4.5.6 Port Management Configuration

##### 4.4.5.6.1 Port Reservation and Release

As part of the Port Management configuration, operations to reserve a
combination of port numbers, release a combination of port numbers,
query the list of port numbers that are reserved and notification of
reservation of a port number may be performed, if the Rds\_dynamic\_port
feature is supported.

If the SCS/AS needs to reserve port numbers and associate them with an
application, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP PUT message to the SCEF,
using the URI received in the response to the request that has created
the NIDD configuration resource and the specific part of
\"/rds-ports/{portId}\" as described in subclause 5.6.3.9.2. The SCS/AS
may use this operation to reserve port numbers on the UE and SCEF and
associate them with an application. Upon receipt of the HTTP PUT request
from the SCS/AS,

\- if the \"skipUeInquiry\" is set to \"false\" and if the \"individual
ManagePort Configuration\" resource already exists in the same NIDD
configuration, the SCEF shall respond with 403 Forbidden response with a
cause value \"PORT\_NOT\_FREE\" in the \"cause\" attribute of the
\"ProblemDetails\" structure; otherwise, the SCEF shall interact with
the UE via the SGSN/MME to reserve the port by using RDS protocol as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.250 \[31\] and return 202 Accept to the SCS/AS
if successful response is received from the SGSN/MME. Then if the SCEF
receives successful UE response, the SCEF shall create the \"individual
ManagePort Configuration\" resource and notify the SCS/AS with the
reserved port as specified in subclause 4.4.5.6.2, the SCEF shall also
mark the resource is created by the SCS/AS; otherwise, the SCEF shall
notify the SCS/AS about the currently reserved ports as specified in
subclause 4.4.5.6.2.

\- if the \"skipUeInquiry\" is set to \"true\" and if the requested SCEF
port already exists in an NIDD configuration within the same APN, the
SCEF shall respond with 403 Forbidden response with a cause value
\"PORT\_NOT\_FREE\" in the \"cause\" attribute of the \"ProblemDetails\"
structure; otherwise, the SCEF shall create the \"individual ManagePort
Configuration\" resource and send an HTTP 201 Created response to the
SCS/AS, the SCEF shall also mark the resource is created by the SCS/AS
and notify the UE by using RDS protocol as specified in
3GPP TS 24.250 \[31\].

If the SCS/AS needs to release port numbers associated with an
application, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP DELETE message to the SCEF,
using the URI received in the response to the request that has created
the \"individual ManagePort Configuration\" resource. Upon receipt of of
the HTTP DELETE request from the SCS/AS, if the \"individual ManagePort
Configuration\" resource does not exist in the same NIDD configuration,
the SCEF shall respond with 404 Not Found with a cause value
\"PORT\_NOT\_ASSOC\_WITH\_APP\" in the \"cause\" attribute of the
\"ProblemDetails\" structure; otherwise if the the \"individual
ManagePort Configuration\" resource was created by the SCS/AS and

\- if the \"skipUeInquiry\" is set to \"false\", the SCEF shall interact
with the UE via the SGSN/MME to release the port by using RDS protocol
as specified in 3GPP TS 24.250 \[31\] and return 202 Accept to the
SCS/AS if successful response is received from the SGSN/MME. Then upon
receipt of the UE response, the SCEF shall notify the SCS/AS with the
currently reserved ports as specified in subclause 4.4.5.6.2.

\- if the \"skipUeInquiry\" is set to \"true\", the SCEF shall delete
the individual ManagePort Configuration resource and respond with an
HTTP 204 No Content response to the SCS/AS. The SCEF shall also notify
the UE by using RDS protocol as specified in 3GPP TS 24.250 \[31\].

If the HTTP DELETE request is received for the \"Individual ManagePort
Configuration\" resource which was created by the UE, the SCEF shall
reject the message with 403 Forbidden response with a cause value
\"OPERATION\_PROHIBITED\" in the \"cause\" attribute of the
\"ProblemDetails\" structure.

If the \"skipUeInquiry\" is set to \"false\" and the SCEF is not able to
interact with the UE because:

\- PDN connection is not established, the SCEF shall reject the HTTP
PUT/DELETE request with a 500 Internal Server Error response with a
cause value \"NO\_PDN\_CONNECTION\";

\- UE is not reachable, the SCEF shall reject the HTTP PUT/DELETE
request with a 500 Internal Server Error response with a cause value
\"TEMPORARILY\_NOT\_REACHABLE\". The response may include a Requested
Re-Transmission time to indicate the SCS/AS when the UE is expected to
be reachable so that the SCS/AS may prepare any re-configuration for the
RDS port; or

\- the interaction with the SGSN/MME is not successful, the SCEF shall
reject the HTTP PUT/DELETE request with a 500 Internal Server Error and
a proper cause value indicating the reason for the delivery failure.

##### 4.4.5.6.2 Port Notification

If the SCEF needs to send the information about reserved ports and their
configuration to the SCS/AS (e.g. due to 3GPP network created or
released \"individual ManagePort Configuration\" resource upon UE
triggered RDS port management procedures as specified in
3GPP TS 24.250 \[31\]), the SCEF shall send an HTTP POST message to the
SCS/AS, using the URI received within the \"notificationDestination\"
attribute in the NiddConfiguration resource. The body of the message is
encoded in JSON format with the data structure defined in
table 5.6.2.1.9-1. The SCS/AS shall acknowledge the HTTP POST request
with an HTTP 200 OK or 204 No Content response.

### 4.4.6 Procedures for Device Triggering

The procedures are used by the SCS/AS to deliver the device trigger via
T8 interface.

In order to create a new device trigger, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP
POST message to the SCEF for the \"Device Triggering Transactions\"
resource. The body of the HTTP POST message shall include the External
Identifier or MSISDN, validity period, priority, Application Port ID and
trigger payload.

Upon receipt of the corresponding HTTP POST message, the SCEF shall
check if the SCS/AS is authorised to send a trigger request and if the
SCS/AS has exceeded its quota or rate of trigger submission. The SCEF
shall also resolve the External Identifier or MSISDN to IMSI and
retrieve the \"Routing Information\" from HSS for the triggering
delivery. If the authorisation check fails, or if the quota or rate of
trigger submission was exceeded, or if there is no valid subscription
information or if the \"Routing Information\" cannot be found, then the
SCEF shall reject the request with an error message to the SCS/AS.
Otherwise, the SCEF shall perform the device trigger procedure over Tsp
as defined in 3GPP TS 29.368 \[24\] and T4 as defined in
3GPP TS 29.337 \[25\]. Upon completion of this procedure, the SCEF shall
create a resource \"Individual Device Triggering Transaction\" which
represents the triggering transaction, addressed by a URI that contains
the SCS/AS identity and an SCEF-created transaction identifier, and
shall respond to the SCS/AS with a 201 Created message, including the
trigger and a Location header field containing the URI for the created
resource. The SCS/AS shall use the URI received in the Location header
in subsequent requests to the SCEF to refer to this device triggering
transaction.

In order to replace an existing device trigger, the SCS/AS shall send an
HTTP PUT message to the SCEF for the \"Individual Device Triggering
Transaction\" resource, using the URI received in the response to the
request that has created the device triggering transaction resource. The
body of the HTTP PUT message shall include External Identifier or
MSISDN, validity period, priority, Application Port ID and trigger
payload.

After receiving the corresponding HTTP PUT message from the SCS/AS, the
SCEF shall check if the SCS/AS is authorised to replace an existing
device trigger and if the SCS/AS has not exceeded its quota or rate of
trigger submission. If any of these checks fail, then the SCEF shall
reject the message with an error. Otherwise, the SCEF shall replace the
device triggering with the SMS-SC by performing the device trigger
replace procedure over Tsp as defined in 3GPP TS 29.368 \[24\] and T4 as
defined in 3GPP TS 29.337 \[25\]. Upon completion of this procedure, the
SCEF shall send an HTTP response to the SCS/AS to indicate trigger
replace success or failure.

In order to recall an existing device trigger, the SCS/AS shall send an
HTTP DELETE message to the SCEF for the \"Individual Device Triggering
Transaction\" resource, using the URI received in the response to the
request that has created the device triggering transaction resource.

After receiving the corresponding HTTP DELETE message from the SCS/AS,
the SCEF shall check if the SCS/AS is authorised to send a recall
trigger request and if the SCS/AS has not exceeded its quota or rate of
trigger submission. The SCEF shall also check if the device triggering
transaction resource referenced by the URI exists. If any of these
checks fail, then the SCEF shall reject the message with an error.
Otherwise, the SCEF shall recall the device triggering with the SMS-SC
by performing the device trigger recall procedure over Tsp as defined in
3GPP TS 29.368 \[24\] and T4 as defined in 3GPP TS 29.337 \[25\]. Upon
completion of this procedure, the SCEF shall send an HTTP response to
the SCS/AS to indicate trigger recall success or failure.

When it receives the Message Delivery Report from the SMS/SC, the SCEF
shall send an HTTP POST message to the SCS/AS to report the trigger
delivery result. The body of the HTTP POST message shall include the
identifier if the transaction and cause. The SCS/AS shall respond with
an HTTP 200 OK or 204 No Content response.

### 4.4.7 Procedures for Group Message Delivery 

#### 4.4.7.1 General

This procedure is used by an SCS/AS to deliver a payload to a group of
UEs. Two methods of Group Message Delivery via the T8 are specified:

\- Group Message Delivery via MBMS which is intended to efficiently
distribute the same content to the members of a group that are located
in a particular geographical area when MBMS is used. This method further
includes two varieties:

\- the MB2 interface (see stage 2 in 3GPP TS 23.468 \[55\] and stage 3
in 3GPP TS 29.468 \[36\]) is used as southbound interface;

\- the xMB interface (see stage 2 in 3GPP TS 26.348 \[56\] and stage 3
in 3GPP TS 29.116 \[37\]) is used as southbound interface.

\- Group Message Delivery via unicast MT NIDD for UEs which are part of
the same External Group Identifier.

NOTE: Group Message Delivery via MT NIDD is defined in
subclause 4.4.5.3.2.

Error handling for the procedures in the subsequent subclauses shall be
handled based on subclause 5.2.6.

#### 4.4.7.2 Group Message Delivery via MBMS

##### 4.4.7.2.1 General

This procedure is used by an SCS/AS to deliver a payload to a group of
UEs via the T8 interface. The SCEF use the Group Message Delivery via
MBMS to efficiently distribute the same content to the members of a
group that are located in a particular geographical area when MBMS is
used.

The procedure of Group message Delivery via MBMS and MB2 used as
southbound interface is described in subcaluse 4.4.7.2.2 and the
procedure of Group message Delivery via MBMS and xMB used as southbound
interface is described in subcaluse 4.4.7.2.3.

##### 4.4.7.2.2 Group Message Delivery via MBMS by MB2

###### 4.4.7.2.2.1 TMGI Allocation

If the SCS/AS acts as a GCS AS in the application level and if there is
no assigned TMGI for an External Group Identifier, the SCS/AS shall send
an HTTP message to the SCEF to the resource \"TMGI Allocation\". The
body of the HTTP POST request message shall include the External Group
Identifier. The SCS/AS may also include the location information in the
body.

Upon receipt of the HTTP POST request from the SCS/AS to allocate a
TMGI, the SCEF shall check whether the SCS/AS is authorized to request
TMGI allocation. If authorization is successful, the SCEF shall initiate
TMGI allocation by the BM-SC as defined in subclause 5.2.1 of
3GPP TS 29.468 \[36\]. Upon successful allocation of a TMGI, the SCEF
shall create the resource which represents the TMGI allocation,
addressed by a URI that contains the SCS identity and TMGI, and shall
respond to the SCS/AS with a 201 Created message including the TMGI and
the TMGI expiration time.

In order to renew the TMGI expiration time, the SCS/AS shall send an
HTTP PUT or PATCH message to the SCEF to the resource \"Individual TMGI
Allocation\". Upon receipt of the HTTP PUT or PATCH request from the
SCS/AS to renew TMGI expiration time, the SCEF shall initiate TMGI
expiration time renewal to the BM-SC as defined in subclause 5.2.1 of
3GPP TS 29.468 \[36\]. Upon successful result, the SCEF shall update the
resource and respond to the SCS/AS by sending an HTTP response with 200
OK including the new TMGI expiration time.

If the SCEF receives the response with an error code from the BM-SC for
the allocation of TMGI or renewal of expiration time for the existing
TMGI, the SCEF shall not create or update the resource and shall respond
to the SCS/AS with a corresponding failure code as described in
subclause 5.2.6.

Upon the TMGI expiration, the SCEF may delete the resource of the TMGI
locally.

Upon receipt of the notification of TMGI expiration by the BM-SC as
defined in subclause 5.2.3 of 3GPP TS 29.468 \[36\], the SCEF shall
delete the resource if not yet deleted.

###### 4.4.7.2.2.2 TMGI Deallocation

In order to deallocate the TMGI, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP DELETE
message to the SCEF to the resource \"Individual TMGI Allocation\". Upon
receipt of the HTTP DELETE request from the SCS/AS to deallocate the
TMGI, the SCEF shall initiate TMGI deallocation by the BM-SC as defined
in subclause 5.2.2 of 3GPP TS 29.468 \[36\]. Upon successful
deallocation of a TMGI, the SCEF shall delete the resource \"Individual
TMGI Allocation\" together with all sub-resouces \"GMD via MBMS by MB2\"
if available,and shall respond to the SCS/AS by sending an HTTP response
with 204 No Content.

###### 4.4.7.2.2.3 Creation of group message delivery

If the SCS/AS acts as a GCS AS in the application level and if the
SCS/AS has an assigned TMGI for the External Group Identifier, in order
to perform the group message delivery, the SCS/AS shall sends an HTTP
POST request message to the SCEF to the resource \"GMD via MBMS by
MB2\". The body of the HTTP POST request message shall include the
External Group Identifier and notification destination URI identifying
the recipient of notification within the \"notificationDestination\"
attribute. The SCS/AS may also include the Group Message Payload, the
location information and a Message Delivery Start Time in the body.

The SCS/AS may also send an HTTP POST message to the SCEF directly to
the resource \"TMGI Allocation\" without previously requesting TMGI
allocation as defined in subclause 4.4.7.2.2. The SCEF shall create the
resource \"Individual TMGI Allocation\" and perform the procedure as
define in subclause 4.4.7.2.2, and shall also create resource \"GMD via
MBMS by MB2\" and perform the procedure as mentioned in this subcaluse
for MBMS bearer creation.

Upon receipt of the HTTP POST request from the SCS/AS to deliver the
group message, the SCEF shall check whether the SCS/AS is authorized to
send a group message request. It also checks to see if the Message
Delivery Start Time does not start after the TMGI expiration. If
authorization is successful, the SCEF shall initiate the Active MBMS
Bearer procedure as defined in subclause 5.3.2 of 3GPP TS 29.468 \[36\]
with the difference that the SCEF acts as a GCS AS. The SCEF shall
include the location information based on the local configuration if the
location information is not provided in the HTTP POST request message.

Upon successful activation of MBMS bearer, the SCEF shall create
resource which represents \"Individual GMD via MBMS by MB2\", addressed
by a URI that contains Transaction Id allocated by the SCEF and respond
to the SCS/AS by sending an HTTP response with a 201 Created status
code, including a Location header field containing the URI for the
created resource. When the SCS/AS receives the URI in the Location
header, it shall use this URI in subsequent requests to the SCEF to
refer to this active MBMS bearer. If the Group Message Payload was not
include in the HTTP POST above, the HTTP response sent from the SCEF
shall also include the SCEF message delivery Ipv4 address or Ipv6
address and port number.

If the SCEF receives the response with an error code from the BM-SC for
the activation of MBMS bearer, the SCEF shall not create the resource
and shall respond to the SCS/AS with a corresponding failure code as
described in subclause 5.2.6.

If the Group Message Payload was included the HTTP POST above, the SCEF
shall deliver to BM-SC the Group Message Payload(s) as defined in
3GPP TS 29.468 \[36\] at Message Delivery Start Time.

If the Group Message Payload was not include in the HTTP POST above, the
SCEF shall transfer the contents received from the SCS/AS to the BM-CS
at or after the requested Group Message Start Time, but before the TMGI
Expiration time. In this case, when the SCEF detects the group message
delivery was triggered successful, the SCEF shall send an HTTP POST
request message to the SCS/AS.

NOTE: If Group Message Payload was included, then at Message Delivery
Start Time, the SCEF delivers to BM-SC the Group Message Payload(s) to
corresponding to MB2-U IP address and port number associated with
respective TMGI.

###### 4.4.7.2.2.4 Modification of previous submitted group message delivery

If the SCS/AS determines that modification of previous accepted Group
Message Delivery Request is required, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP
PATCH or HTTP PUT request message to the SCEF to the resource
\"Individual GMD via MBMS by MB2\". The body of the HTTP PATCH request
message shall include the Message Delivery Start Time. The SCS/AS may
also include the External Group Identifier, the Group Message Payload
and the location information in the body. The body of the HTTP PUT
request message shall include the information as the information
provided in the HTTP POST in subclause 4.4.7.2.2.2.3. The body of the
HTTP PATCH request message shall include the information defined in the
data type of GMDViaMBMSByMb2Patch as defined in subclause 5.8.2.1.1.6.

Upon receipt of the HTTP PATCH or HTTP PUT request from the SCS/AS to
modify the previous group message delivery subscription, the SCEF shall
check whether the SCS/AS is authenticated and authorized to modify the
submitted group message delivery. If the authorization is successful,
the SCEF shall initiate the Modify MBMS Bearer procedure as defined in
subclause 5.3.4 of 3GPP TS 29.468 \[36\] with the difference that the
SCEF acts as a GCS AS. The SCEF shall include the location information
based on the local configuration if the location information is not
provided in the HTTP PATCH or HTTP PUT request message.

Upon successful modification of MBMS bearer, the SCEF shall update the
resource and respond to the SCS/AS with a 200 OK success message
indicating that previous group message delivery subscription is
successfully updated.

If the SCEF receives the response with an error code from the BM-SC for
the modification of MBMS bearer, the SCEF shall not update the resource
and shall respond to the SCS/AS with a corresponding failure code as
described in subclause 5.2.6.

###### 4.4.7.2.2.5 Cancellation of previous submitted group message delivery

If the SCS/AS determines that deletion of previous accepted Group
Message Delivery Request is required, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP
DELETE request message to the SCEF.

Upon receipt of the HTTP DELETE request from the SCS/AS to delete the
previous group message delivery, the SCEF shall check whether the SCS/AS
is authenticated and authorized to delete an existing group message
delivery subscription. If the authorization is successful, the SCEF
shall initiate the Delete MBMS Bearer procedure as defined in
subclause 5.3.3 of 3GPP TS 29.468 \[36\] with the difference that the
SCEF acts as a GCS AS.

Upon successful deletion of MBMS bearer, the SCEF shall respond to the
SCS/AS with a 204 No Content message indicating that submitted group
message delivery is successfully deleted.

##### 4.4.7.2.3 Group message Delivery via MBMS by xMB

###### 4.4.7.2.3.1 Service Creation

If the SCS/AS acts as a content provider in the application level and if
there is no assigned Service ID for an External Group Identifier, the
SCS/AS shall send an HTTP POST message to the SCEF to the resource \"xMB
Services\". The body of the HTTP POST request message shall include the
External Group Identifier.

Upon receipt of the HTTP POST request from the SCS/AS to create a
service, the SCEF shall check whether the SCS/AS is authorized to
request service creation. If authorization is successful, the SCEF shall
initiate service creation by the BM-SC as defined in subclause 5.2.1.2.2
of 3GPP TS 29.116 \[37\]. Upon successful service creation, the SCEF
shall create the resource which represents the service creation,
addressed by a URI that contains the SCS identity and Service Id, and
shall respond to the SCS/AS with a 201 Created message which may include
the service announcement information.

If the SCEF receives the response with an error status code from the
BM-SC for the service creation, the SCEF shall not create or update the
resource and shall respond to the SCS/AS with a corresponding failure
code as described in subclause 5.2.6.

###### 4.4.7.2.3.2 Service Deletion

In order to delete the service, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP DELETE
message to the SCEF to the resource \"Individual xMB Service\". Upon
receipt of the HTTP DELETE request from the SCS/AS to delete the
service, the SCEF shall initiate service deletion by the BM-SC as
defined in subclause 5.2.1.2.4 of 3GPP TS 29.116 \[37\]. Upon successful
deletion of a service, the SCEF shall delete the resource \"Individual
xMB Service\" together with all sub-resouces \"GMD via MBMS by xMB\" if
available, and shall respond to the SCS/AS by sending an HTTP response
with 204 No Content.

###### 4.4.7.2.3.3 Creation of group message delivery

If the SCS/AS acts as a content provider in the application level, the
SCS/AS may sends an HTTP POST request message to the SCEF to the
resource \"GMD via MBMS by xMB\". The body of the HTTP POST request
message shall include the External Group Identifier and notification
destination URI identifying the recipient of notification within the
\"notificationDestination\" attribute. The SCS/AS may also include the
Group Message Payload, the location information, a Message Delivery
Start Time and Message Delivery Stop Time in the body.

Upon receipt of the HTTP POST request from the SCS/AS to deliver the
group message, the SCEF shall check whether the SCS/AS is authorized to
send a group message request. It also checks to see if the Message
Delivery Start Time doesn\'t start after the Message Delivery Stop Time.
If authorization is successful, the SCEF shall initiate the Create
Session procedure as defined in subclause 4.4.5.2 of
3GPP TS 29.116 \[37\] and the Update Session procedure as defined in
subclause 4.4.5.3 of 3GPP TS 29.116 \[37\] with the difference that the
SCEF acts as a Content Provider, Session Start is set accordiong to the
Message Delivery Start Time and the Session Stop is set according to the
Message Delivery Stop Time. The SCEF shall include the location
information based on the local configuration if the location information
is not provided and include the session type set to \"Files\" in the
HTTP POST request message.

Upon successful activation of MBMS bearer, the SCEF shall create
resource which represents \"Individual GMD via MBMS by xMB \", addressed
by a URI that contains Transaction Id allocated by the SCEF and respond
to the SCS/AS by sending an HTTP response with a 201 Created status
code, including a Location header field containing the URI for the
created resource. When the SCS/AS receives the URI in the Location
header, it shall use this URI in subsequent requests to the SCEF to
refer to this active MBMS bearer. If the Group Message Payload was not
included in the HTTP POST above, the HTTP response sent from the SCEF
shall also include the SCEF message delivery Ipv4 address or Ipv6
address and port number.

If the SCEF receives the response with an error code from the BM-SC for
the activation of MBMS bearer, the SCEF shall not create the resource
and shall respond to the SCS/AS with a corresponding failure code as
described in subclause 5.2.6.

If the Group Message Payload was included the HTTP POST above, the SCEF
shall deliver to BM-SC the Group Message Payload(s) as defined in
3GPP TS 29.468 \[36\] at Message Delivery Start Time.

If the Group Message Payload was not included in the HTTP POST above,
the SCEF shall transfer the contents received from the SCS/AS to the
BM-CS at or after the requested Message Delivery Start Time, but before
the Message Delivery Stop Time. In this case, when the SCEF detects the
group message delivery was triggered successful, the SCEF shall send an
HTTP POST request message to the SCS/AS.

###### 4.4.7.2.3.4 Modification of previous submitted group message delivery

If the SCS/AS determines that modification of previous accepted Group
Message Delivery Request is required, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP
PATCH or HTTP PUT request message to the SCEF to the resource
\"Individual GMD via MBMS by xMB \". The body of the HTTP PATCH request
message shall include the Message Delivery Start Time and Message
Delivery Stop Time. The SCS/AS may also include the External Group
Identifier, the Group Message Payload and the location information in
the body. The body of the HTTP PUT request message shall include the

include the information defined in the data type of GMDViaMBMSByxMBPatch
as defined in subclause 5.8.3.1.1.4.

Upon receipt of the HTTP PATCH or HTTP PUT request from the SCS/AS to
modify the previous group message delivery subscription, the SCEF shall
check whether the SCS/AS is authenticated and authorized to modify the
submitted group message delivery. If the authorization is successful,
the SCEF shall initiate the Update Session procedure as defined in
subclause 4.4.5.3 of 3GPP TS 29.116 \[37\] with the difference that the
SCEF acts as a Content Provider, Session Start is set accordiong to the
Message Delivery Start Time and the Session Stop is set according to the
Message Delivery Stop Time. The SCEF shall include the location
information based on the local configuration if the location information
is not provided in the HTTP PATCH or HTTP PUT request message.

Upon successful modification of MBMS bearer, the SCEF shall respond to
the SCS/AS with a 200 OK success message indicating that previous group
message delivery subscription is successfully updated.

If the SCEF receives the response with an error code from the BM-SC for
the modification of MBMS bearer, the SCEF shall not update the resource
and shall respond to the SCS/AS with a corresponding failure code as
described in subclause 5.2.6.

###### 4.4.7.2.3.5 Cancellation of previous submitted group message delivery

If the SCS/AS determines that deletion of previous accepted Group
Message Delivery Request is required, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP
DELETE request message to the SCEF.

Upon receipt of the HTTP DELETE request from the SCS/AS to delete the
previous group message delivery, the SCEF shall check whether the SCS/AS
is authenticated and authorized to delete an existing group message
delivery subscription. If the authorization is successful, the SCEF
shall initiate the Delete Session procedure as defined in
subclause 4.4.5.4 of 3GPP TS 29.116 \[37\] with the difference that the
SCEF acts as a Content Provider.

Upon successful deletion of MBMS bearer, the SCEF shall respond to the
SCS/AS with a 204 No Content message indicating that submitted group
message delivery is successfully deleted.

### 4.4.8 Procedures for Reporting of Network Status

#### 4.4.8.1 General

These procedures are used by an SCS/AS to perform reporting of network
status via the T8 interface in one time or continuous reporting cases.
The SCEF uses the reporting procedures based on the network status
information from one or more RCAF(s). These procedures can also be used
by the SCS/AS to indicate the removal of a previously subscribed
reporting request.

#### 4.4.8.2 Network Status Reporting Subscription

In order to create a new subscription to request for notification about
the network status, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP POST message to the
SCEF for the \"Network Status Reporting Subscriptions\" resource. The
body of HTTP POST message shall include a Notification destination
address and Location area, and may include time duration and threshold
(s).

Upon receiving the HTTP POST message from the SCS/AS, the SCEF shall
check:

\- if the SCS/AS is authorized to perform the request. If not the SCEF
shall respond to the SCS/AS with a status code set to 401 Unauthorized.

\- if the SCS/AS has exceeded its quota of submitting requests. If so
the SCEF shall respond to the SCS/AS with a status code set to 403
Forbidden and may indicate the failure reason \"QUOTA\_EXCEEDED\" (i.e.
the quota exceeded) within the \"cause\" attribute of the
\"ProblemDetails\" structure in the HTTP POST response.

\- if the SCS/AS has exceeded its rate of submitting requests. If so the
SCEF shall respond to the SCS/AS with a status code set to 429 Too Many
Requests in the HTTP POST response.

After the SCEF authorized the HTTP request message, the SCEF shall
create a resource \"Individual Network Status Reporting Subscription\"
which represents the subscription, addressed by a URI that contains the
SCS/AS identity and an SCEF-created subscription identifier, and shall
respond to the SCS/AS with a 201 Created message, including a Location
header field containing the URI for the created resource, to acknowledge
to the SCS/AS the successful subscription. The SCS/AS shall use the URI
received in the Location header in subsequent requests to the SCEF to
refer to this network status reporting subscription. Then, the SCEF
shall perform request of network status reporting procedure with the
RCAF over Ns interface as defined in 3GPP TS 29.153 \[30\].

In order to update an existing subscription of continuous network status
reporting, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP PUT message to the SCEF for the
\"Individual Network Status Reporting Subscription\" resource, using the
URI received in the response to the request that has created the network
status reporting subscription resource. After receiving the HTTP PUT
message, the SCEF shall send an HTTP response to the SCS/AS with a 200
OKstatus code and include the result in the body of the HTTP response.
Then, the SCEF shall make the change and interact with the RCAF as
defined in 3GPP TS 29.153 \[30\].

NOTE: In order to update an existing subscription, the SCEF needs to
send a cancellation to the previously associated RCAF(s) to remove the
related SCEF instructions and then send a new request with updated
parameters.

In order to remove an existing subscription of continuous network status
reporting, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP DELETE message to the SCEF for
the \"Individual Network Status Reporting Subscription\" resource, using
the URI received in the response to the request that has created the
network status reporting subscription resource. Upon receipt of the HTTP
DELETE message, the SCEF shall send an HTTP response to the SCS/AS with
a 204 No Content status code. Then, the SCEF shall interact with the
RCAF to terminate the continuous reporting of network status as defined
in 3GPP TS 29.153 \[30\].

#### 4.4.8.3 Network Status Reporting Notification

After receiving reports from all the involved RCAF(s) as defined in
3GPP TS 29.153 \[30\], the SCEF shall send an HTTP POST message to the
SCS/AS using the identified destination URL, which is provided by the
SCS/AS during the network status reporting subscription. The body of
HTTP POST message shall include the NSI.

### 4.4.9 Procedures for Communication Pattern Parameters Provisioning

One or more set of CP parameters may be provisioned by the SCS/AS for a
single UE or a group of UEs.

In order to create resources for one or more CP parameter set(s), the
SCS/AS shall send an HTTP POST message to the SCEF for the \"CP
Provisioning Subscriptions\" resource, including one or more new
provisioned CP parameter set(s). The body of HTTP POST message shall
include External Identifier or MSISDN for a single UE or External Group
ID for a group of UEs, SCS/AS Identifier and one or more set of CP
information associated with CP parameter set Id(s).

After receiving the HTTP POST message, the SCEF shall check if the
SCS/AS is authorised. The SCEF may also check if the number of CP
parameter sets(s) reaches the limitation based on operator policy or
configuration.

After validation, the SCEF shall for each received CP parameter set Id,
assign an SCEF Reference ID which may be derived from the CP parameter
set Id, and send Update CP Parameter Request message to the HSS for
delivering the CP parameter set(s) as specified in
3GPP TS 29.336 \[11\].

After receiving result from the HSS, if the result is successful, the
SCEF shall create a resource \"Individual CP Provisioning Subscription\"
and the corresponding sub-resources \"Individual CP Set Provisioning\"
each represents a successfully provisioned CP parameter set indicated by
the HSS and respond to the SCS/AS with a 201 Created including Location
header field containing the URI for the created subscription resource
\"Individual CP Provisioning Subscription\" and the sub-resource(s)
\"Individual CP Set Provisioning\" corresponding to each successful CP
parameter set within the \"self\" attribute in the \"cpParameterSet\"
attribute; otherwise, the SCEF shall not create any resource and shall
respond to the SCS/AS with a corresponding failure code as described in
subclause 5.2.6. If not all CP parameters sets are provisioned
successfully (i.e. the HSS indicates failure for some or all CP
parameter sets and/or the SCEF does not accept the CP parameter
provisioning (e.g. one or more CP Set Identifiers in the request are
already present in existing subscriptions)), the SCEF shall also include
CP report(s) within attribute \"cpReports\" with a list of failed CP Set
Identifier(s) and the corresponding failure code as specified in
table 5.10.2.3.5-1 in the body of the HTTP response.

In order to add new CP parameter set(s), update and/or remove the
existing CP parameter set(s) for one or more CP parameter set Id(s), the
SCS/AS may send an HTTP PUT message to the SCEF for the \"Individual CP
Provisioning Subscription\" resource requesting to add new CP parameter
set(s) by creating new resource(s), change some created properties (e.g.
Validity Time) of the existing resource(s), and/or remove some or entire
properties of the existing resource(s). After receiving the HTTP PUT
message, the SCEF shall send the CP parameter changes to the HSS as
specified in 3GPP TS 29.336 \[11\]. After receiving the response from
the HSS with a successful code, if the HSS indicates all CP parameter
sets or some CP parameter sets are provisioned successfully, the SCEF
shall create or update the corresponding sub-resource(s) \"Individual CP
Set Provisioning\" each represents a successfully provisioned CP
parameter set indicated by the HSS and send an HTTP response to the
SCS/AS with a 200 OK status code and include a list of successful CP
parameter set(s) in the body of the HTTP response. Otherwise, the SCEF
shall not create or update the resource(s) and shall send an HTTP
response to the SCS/AS with a corresponding failure code as described in
subclause 5.2.6. If not all CP parameters sets are provisioned
successfully (i.e. the HSS indicates failure for some or all CP
parameter sets and/or the SCEF does not accept the CP parameter
provisioning (e.g. one or more CP Set Identifiers in the request are
already present in existing subscriptions)), the SCEF shall also include
CP report(s) within attribute \"cpReports\" with a list of failed CP Set
Identifier(s) and the corresponding failure code as specified in
table 5.10.2.3.5-1 in the body of the HTTP response.

The SCS/AS may send a HTTP PUT message to the SCEF for the \"Individual
CP Set Provisioning\" resource requesting to replace an individual
resource identified by the CP parameter set Id. The body of the HTTP PUT
message shall include set of CP information. After receiving such
request, the SCEF shall interact with the HSS as specified in
3GPP TS 29.336 \[11\]. After receiving the response from the HSS with a
successful code, the SCEF shall update the resource and send an HTTP
response to the SCS/AS with a 200 OK status code; otherwise, the SCEF
shall not update the resource and shall send an HTTP response to the
SCS/AS with a corresponding failure code as described in
subclause 5.2.6. If the provisioning of the CP set fails (i.e. the HSS
returns failure for the CP set or the SCEF does not accept the CP set
provisioning), the SCEF shall reject the request with a corresponding
status code, and include the attribute \"cpReports\" with the
corresponding failure code as specified in table 5.10.2.3.5-1 and the CP
Set Identifier for which the provisioning has failed.

The SCS/AS may send an HTTP DELETE message to the SCEF requesting to
delete an individual CP set resource \"Individual CP Set Provisioning\".
After receiving such request, the SCEF shall determine the SCEF
Reference ID for Deletion associated with the CP parameter set Id, and
interact with the HSS as specified in 3GPP TS 29.336 \[11\]. After
receiving the response from the HSS, the SCEF shall delete the addressed
resource and send an HTTP response to the SCS/AS with a 204 No Content
status code.

The SCS/AS may send an HTTP DELETE message to the SCEF requesting to
delete an individual subscription resource \"Individual CP Provisioning
Subscription\". After receiving such request, the SCEF shall determine
the SCEF Reference ID (s) for Deletion associated with the CP parameter
set Id(s) and interact with the HSS as specified in
3GPP TS 29.336 \[11\]. After receiving the response from the HSS, the
SCEF shall delete the addressed resource and its sub-resources addressed
by \"Individual CP Set Provisioning\" and send an HTTP response to the
SCS/AS with a 204 No Content status code.

### 4.4.10 Procedures for PFD Management

The PFDs associated with application identifier(s) may be created,
updated or removed by the third party SCS/AS as defined in
3GPP TS 23.682 \[2\].

In order to create PFDs resources for one or more external Application
Identifier(s), the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP POST message to the request
URI of the resource \"PFD Management Transactions\" including one or
more set of PFDs for external Application Identifier(s). The body of the
HTTP POST message shall include external Application Identifier(s) and
PFDs associated with its PFD Identifier(s), an Allowed Delay may be
included for the external Application Identifier(s) as well.

After receiving the HTTP POST message, if the SCS/AS is authorized, the
SCEF shall provision the PFDs to the PFDF as defined in
3GPP TS 29.250 \[26\]. When receiving the response from the PFDF, the
SCEF shall send an HTTP response to the SCS/AS with a corresponding
status code. If one or more external application identifiers are
provisioned successfully, the SCEF shall create an \"Individual PFD
Management Transaction\" resource for the request and he corresponding
sub-resources \"Individual Application PFD Management\" each represents
a successfully provisioned external application identifier. The SCEF
shall respond to the SCS/AS with a 201 Created including Location header
field containing the URI for the created transaction resource
\"Individual PFD Management Transaction\" and the sub-resource(s)
\"Individual Application PFD Management\" corresponding to each external
application identifier within the \"self\" attribute in the \"PfdData\"
data type, the SCEF shall also include PFD report(s) with a list of
external Application Identifier(s) and result(s) in the body of the HTTP
response if some application(s) are not provisioned successfully (i.e.
the PFDF returns failure and/or the SCEF does not accept the PFD
provisioning (e.g. one or more external Application Identifiers in the
request are already present in existing transactions)).

In order to update the PFDs for an existing individual transaction, the
SCS/AS shall send an HTTP PUT message to URI of the resource
\"Individual PFD Management Transaction\" including one or more set of
PFDs for external Application Identifier(s). After receiving the HTTP
PUT message, the SCEF shall make the change and send the change to the
PFDF (i.e. add/update/remove PFDs) as defined in 3GPP TS 29.250 \[26\].
After receiving the response from the PFDF, the SCEF shall send an HTTP
response to the SCS/AS with a corresponding status code. The SCEF shall
create or update the corresponding sub-resource(s) \"Individual
Application PFD Management\" each represents a successfully provisioned
external application identifier, and also include PFD report(s) with a
list of external Application Identifier(s) and result(s) in the body of
the HTTP response if some application(s) are not provisioned
successfully (i.e. the PFDF returns failure and/or the SCEF does not
accept the PFD provisioning (e.g. one or more external Application
Identifiers in the request are already present in existing
transactions)).

NOTE 1: When the PUT for \"Individual PFD Management Transaction\" is
received in the SCEF, SCEF can use partial update or full update towards
the PFDF.

In order to remove the PFDs for an existing individual transaction, the
SCS/AS shall send an HTTP DELETE message to the URI of the resource
\"Individual PFD Management Transaction\". After receiving such request,
the SCEF shall delete the \"Individual PFD Management Transaction\"
resource and its \"Individual Application PFD Management\"
sub-resouce(s), and shall interact with the PFDF as defined in
3GPP TS 29.250 \[26\]. After receiving the response from the PFDF, the
SCEF shall send an HTTP response to the SCS/AS with a corresponding
status code.

For the POST message to the resource \"PFD Management Transactions\" or
the PUT message to the resource \"Individual PFD Management
Transaction\", if the provisioning of all application(s) fails (i.e. the
PFDF returns failure and/or the SCEF does not accept the PFD
provisioning), the SCEF shall respond with 500 Internal Server Error
status code, and include the attribute \"pfdReports\" with the
corresponding failure reason as specified in table 5.11.2.2.3-1 and the
external Application Identifier(s) for which the provisioning has
failed.

In order to update the PFDs for an existing external Application
Identifier, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP PUT message to the resource
\"Individual Application PFD Management\" to update the full set of PFDs
of an existing resource. After receiving the HTTP PUT message, the SCEF
shall make the change and send the change to the PFDF (i.e.
add/update/remove PFDs) as defined in 3GPP TS 29.250 \[26\]. After
receiving the response from the PFDF, the SCEF shall send an HTTP
response to the SCS/AS with a corresponding status code.

NOTE 2: When the PUT for \"Individual Application PFD Management\" is
received in the SCEF, SCEF can use partial update or full update towards
the PFDF.

In order to update the PFDs for an existing external Application
Identifier, the SCS/AS may also send an HTTP PATCH message to URI of the
resource \"Individual Application PFD Management\" to partially update
PFDs. After receiving the HTTP PATCH message, the SCEF shall make the
change and send the change to the PFDF (i.e. add/update/remove PFDs) as
defined in 3GPP TS 29.250 \[26\]. After receiving the response from the
PFDF, the SCEF shall send an HTTP response to the SCS/AS with a
corresponding status code.

In order to remove the PFDs for an existing individual application, the
SCS/AS shall send an HTTP DELETE message to the resource \"Individual
Application PFD Management\". After receiving such request, the SCEF
shall delete the resource and interact with the PFDF as defined in
3GPP TS 29.250 \[26\]. After receiving the response from the PFDF, the
SCEF shall send an HTTP response to the SCS/AS with a corresponding
status code.

For the PUT/PATCH message to the resource \"Individual Application PFD
Management\", if the provisioning of the application fails (i.e. the
PFDF returns failure or the SCEF does not accept the PFD provisioning),
the SCEF shall reject the request with a corresponding status code, and
include the attribute \"pfdReports\" with the corresponding failure code
as specified in table 5.11.2.2.3-1 and the external Application
Identifier for which the provisioning has failed.

If the SCEF receives PFD management notification including the PFD
failure report from the PFDF (as defined in 3GPP TS 29.250 \[26\]) and
if the feature PfdMgmtNotification is supported, the SCEF shall notify
the SCS/AS with an HTTP POST message, identified by the notification
destination URI received during the PFD provisioning, to notify the
failure result for the PFD management by including the PfdReport data
type in the body of the message. Within the PfdReport data type, the
SCEF shall include the impacted application id(s) within the
\"externalAppIds\" attribute, the \"failureCode\" attribute set to
\"PARTIAL\_FAILURE\". In addition, if the SCEF receives the location
area(s) of PCEF/TDF(s) which are unable to enforce the PFD(s) from the
PFDF, the SCEF shall include the location area(s) within the
\"locationArea\" attribute of the PFD report(s). After receiving the
HTTP POST message, the SCS/AS shall send a HTTP response with \"204 No
Content\" status code.

NOTE 3: How the SCS/AS reacts to the failed PFD provisioning is left to
implementation.

NOTE 4: The SCEF maps the 3GPP network area(s) to the geographic area(s)
or civic address(es) if the 3GPP network area(s) is not allowed to be
exposed to the 3rd party according to the operator policy.

### 4.4.11 Procedures for Enhanced Coverage Restriction Control

The procedures are used by an SCS/AS to query the status of, or to
configure the enhanced coverage restriction for a UE via the T8
interface as defined in 3GPP TS 23.682 \[2\].

In order to query the current status of enhanced coverage restriction,
the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP POST message to the SCEF using the query
custom operation as defined in subclause 5.12.13.2. The body of the HTTP
POST message shall include External Identifier or MSISDN.

In order to configure the enhanced coverage restriction, the SCS/AS
shall send an HTTP POST message to the SCEF using the configure custom
operation as defined in subclause 5.12.13.3. The body of the HTTP POST
message shall include External Identifier or MSISDN and the Enhanced
Coverage Restriction setting (i.e. allowed-PLMN-List or
restricted-PLMN-List).

Upon receiving the HTTP POST message from the SCS/AS, the SCEF shall
check:

\- if the SCS/AS is authorized to perform the request. If not the SCEF
shall respond to the SCS/AS with a status code set to 401 Unauthorized.

\- if the request is malformed. If it is malformed, the SCEF shall
respond to the SCS/AS with a status code set to 400 Bad Request.

\- if the SCS/AS has exceeded its quota of submitting requests. If so
the SCEF shall respond to the SCS/AS with a status code set to 403
Forbidden and may indicate the failure reason \"QUOTA\_EXCEEDED\" (i.e.
the quota exceeded) within the \"cause\" attribute of the
\"ProblemDetails\" structure in the HTTP POST response.

\- if the SCS/AS has exceeded its rate of submitting requests. If so the
SCEF shall respond to the SCS/AS with a status code set to 429 Too Many
Requests in the HTTP POST response.

The SCEF shall send a Configuration Information Request to the HSS to
query or configure the setting of Enhanced Coverage Restriction as
defined in 3GPP TS 29.336 \[11\].

Upon receipt of the response from the HSS, the SCEF shall send an HTTP
response to the SCS/AS with a 200 OK message for query or configure
custom operation and include the Enhanced Coverage Restriction Data from
HSS into the HTTP response.

If the SCEF receives a response with an error code from the HSS, the
SCEF shall respond to the SCS/AS with a corresponding failure code as
described in subclause 5.2.6.

### 4.4.12 Procedures for Network Parameter Configuration

#### 4.4.12.1 General

The procedures are used by an SCS/AS to request that the network
consider setting the suggested network parameter values which can
influence certain aspects of UE/network behaviour. The procedures are
applicable for an individual UE or a group of UEs.

In order to create a new network parameter configuration to configure
suggested network parameters, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP POST request
message to the SCEF to the resource \"NP Configurations\". The body of
the HTTP request message shall include External Identifier or MSISDN or
External Group Identifier, SCS/AS Identifier, and may include Maximum
Latency, Maximum Response Time and Suggested Number of Downlink Packets
and Group Reporting Guard Time, wherein, the External Identifier or
MSISDN indicates the configuration for an individual UE and the External
Group Identifier indicates for a group of UEs. If the External Group
Identifier is included, the SCS/AS shall provide the Notification
Destination Address in the request.

NOTE: The Notification Delivery as described in subclause 5.2.5 is not
supported for individual UE configuration case.

In order to update an existing Network Parameter Configuration, the
SCS/AS may send an HTTP PUT message to the resource \"Individual NP
Configuration\" requesting the SCEF to replace all properties in the
existing resource.

The SCS/AS may also use an HTTP PATCH message to request to change some
properties in the existing resource.

Upon receipt of the HTTP POST, PUT or PATCH message, if the SCS/AS is
authorized to perform the request, the SCEF shall check whether the
Maximum Latency, Maximum Response Time and/or Suggested Number of
Downlink Packets in the HTTP request body are within the range defined
by operator policies, if one or more of these parameters are not within
the range, the SCEF shall:

\- either reject the request message by sending an HTTP response to the
SCS/AS with a status code set to \"403 Forbidden\" and may indicate the
\"PARAMETER\_OUT\_OF\_RANGE\" error in the \"cause\" attribute of the
\"ProblemDetails\" structure and indicate which parameters are out of
the range in the \"invalidParams\" attribute of the \"ProblemDetails\"
structure; or

\- modify the parameters which are not within the range by selecting
different values which are in the range.

After validation, the SCEF shall perform the Network Parameter
Configuration as described in subclause 4.4.12.2 for an individual UE or
in subclause 4.4.12.3 for a group of UEs.

In order to delete an existing Network Parameter Configuration at the
SCEF, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP DELETE message to the corresponding
resource \"Individual NP Configuration\" at the SCEF. The SCEF shall
determine the SCEF Reference ID for deletion and interact with the HSS
via S6t as defined in 3GPP TS 29.336 \[11\]. Upon receipt of the
response from the HSS, the SCEF shall delete active resource
\"Individual NP Configuration\" addressed by the URI and send an HTTP
response to the SCS/AS with a \"204 No Content\" status code.

#### 4.4.12.2 Configuration Request for an individual UE

If the configuration request from the SCS/AS is for an individual UE,
the SCEF shall send the Configuration Information Request command to the
HSS via S6t as defined in 3GPP TS 29.336 \[11\].

Upon receipt of the response from the HSS, the SCEF shall,

\- for the HTTP POST message, create a new resource \"Individual NP
Configuration\" addressed by a URI that contains the SCS/AS identifier
and an SCEF-created configuration identifier, and send an HTTP POST
response to the SCS/AS with \"201 Created\" status code, the final
suggested configuration parameter(s) (if modified), the indication(s)
for the discarded parameter(s) (if discarded), and a location header
field containing the URI for the created resource.

\- for the HTTP PUT or PATCH message, update the active resource
\"Individual NP Configuration\", and send an HTTP response to the SCS/AS
with \"200 OK\" status code, the final suggested network parameter(s)
(if modified), the indication(s) for the discarded parameter(s) (if
discarded).

If the SCEF receives a response with an error code from the HSS, the
SCEF shall not create or update the resource and shall respond to the
SCS/AS with a corresponding failure code as described in
subclause 5.2.6.

#### 4.4.12.3 Configuration Request for a group of UEs

If the configuration request from the SCS/AS is for a group of UEs, the
SCS/AS shall provide the Notification Destination Address, the SCEF
shall send the Configuration Information Request command to the HSS via
S6t as defined in 3GPP TS 29.336 \[11\].

Upon receipt of the successful response indicating that group processing
is in progress from the HSS before beginning the processing of
individual UEs, the SCEF shall,

\- for the HTTP POST message, create a resource \"Individual NP
Configuration\" addressed by a URI that contains the SCS/AS identity and
an SCEF-created configuration identifier. The SCEF shall send an HTTP
POST response to the SCS/AS including a location header field containing
the URI for the created resource and a \"201 Created\" status code to
acknowledge the SCS/AS of the successful group processing request.

\- for the HTTP PUT or PATCH message, update the resource \"Individual
NP Configuration\" addressed by the requested URL, and shall send \"200
OK\" status code to acknowledge the SCS/AS of the successful group
processing request in the HTTP response message.

If the SCEF receives a response with an error code from the HSS, the
SCEF shall not create or update the resource and shall respond to the
SCS/AS with a corresponding failure code as described in
subclause 5.2.6.

Upon receipt of the processing result of the individual UEs from the
HSS, the SCEF shall send an HTTP POST request message with a reference
to the related network parameter configuration and a list of processing
result for the group members to the SCS/AS.

The SCS/AS shall send an HTTP response to acknowledge the SCEF about the
handling result of the received request.

#### 4.4.12.4 Notification of applied parameter configuration

If the Enhanced\_param\_config feature is supported and the SCEF
receives currently applied parameter configuration from the HSS, the
SCEF shall notify the SCS/AS by the HTTP POST message including the
parameter changes in the \"appliedParam\" attribute.

### 4.4.13 Procedures for setting up an AS session with required QoS

This procedure is used to set up an AS session with required QoS for the
service as defined in 3GPP TS 23.682 \[2\].

For initial AS session creation, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP POST
message to the SCEF for the \"AS Session with Required QoS
Subscriptions\" resource. The body of HTTP POST message shall include
SCS/AS Identifier, UE IP address, IP Flow description, QoS reference and
notification destination address. And it may also include time period
and/or traffic volume for sponsored data connectivity purpose.

After receiving the HTTP POST message, the SCEF shall authorize the
request and may check if the total number of requested QoS reference has
exceeded the limit for the SCS/AS. If the authorization is successful,
the SCEF shall map the SCS/AS Identifier to AF Application Identifier,
and if required, map the SCS/AS Identifier to ASP Identity and Sponsor
Identity.

NOTE 1: Before the QoS reference is mapped to Rx parameters, the SCEF
can perform a mapping from the name space of the 3rd party SCS/AS to the
name space of the operator.

NOTE 2: The QoS reference referring to pre-defined QoS information in
the SCEF can be mapped to media component descriptions (e.g. bandwidth,
media type) according to SLA.

NOTE 3: In this release of current specification, the SCS/AS Identifier
can only be mapped to one AF Application Identifier based on operator
policy and/or local configuration in the SCEF.

If the authorization performed by the SCEF is successful, then the SCEF
shall act as an AF to interact with the PCRF via the Rx interface as
defined in 3GPP TS 29.214 \[10\] or 3GPP TS 29.201 \[13\] and trigger a
PCRF initiated IP-CAN Session Modification. The SCEF shall also request
to be notified about the transmission resource status, i.e.
INDICATION\_OF\_SUCCESSFUL\_RESOURCES\_ALLOCATION,
INDICATION\_OF\_RELEASE\_OF\_BEARER,
INDICATION\_OF\_FAILED\_RESOURCES\_ALLOCATION, and optionally
INDICATION\_OF\_LOSS\_OF\_BEARER and
INDICATION\_OF\_RECOVERY\_OF\_BEARER. If the time period and/or traffic
volume are received from the AF, the SCEF should subscribe to the PCRF
on the USAGE\_REPORT event.

The SCEF, after receiving the AAA message or HTTP 201 Created message
over the Rx interface from the PCRF with successful result code, shall
create a resource \"Individual AS Session with Required QoS
Subscription\" which represents AS session, addressed by a URI that
contains the SCS/AS identity and an SCEF-created AS session identifier,
and shall respond to the SCS/AS with a 201 Created message, including
the result in the body of the HTTP response and a Location header field
containing the URI for the created resource. The SCS/AS shall use the
URI received in the Location header in subsequent requests to the SCEF
to refer to this AS session. Otherwise, the SCEF shall send an HTTP
response to the SCS/AS with a corresponding status code and include the
result in the body of the HTTP response. If the SCEF receives a response
with an error code from the PCRF, the SCEF shall not create the resource
and respond to the SCS/AS with a corresponding failure code as described
in subclause 5.2.6.

In order to update the established AS session, the SCS/AS may send an
HTTP PUT message to the SCEF for the \"Individual AS Session with
Required QoS Subscription\" resource requesting to replace all
properties (e.g. new usage threshold, Flow Description) in the existing
resource, addressed by the URI received in the response to the request
that has created the resource. The UE IP or MAC address shall remain
unchanged from previously provided values. After receiving such message,
the SCEF shall make the change (e.g. if the usage threshold within the
\"usageThreshold\" attribute is included in the HTTP PUT request and the
accumulated usage report for the previously provided usage threshold is
not received yet, the SCEF shall completely replace the previously
provided one), and interact with the PCRF to modify the Rx session (as
defined in 3GPP TS 29.214 \[10\] or 3GPP TS 29.201 \[13\]). After
receiving the response with successful result code from the PCRF, the
SCEF shall replace all properties of the existing resource, send an HTTP
response to the SCS/AS with a corresponding status code, and include the
result in the body of the HTTP response. If the SCEF receives a response
with an error code from the PCRF, the SCEF shall not update the resource
and respond to the SCS/AS with a corresponding failure code as described
in subclause 5.2.6.

The SCS/AS may also send an HTTP PATCH message to the SCEF for the
\"Individual AS Session with Required QoS Subscription\" resource
requesting to change some created properties (e.g. new usage threshold,
Flow Description). After receiving the HTTP PATCH message, the SCEF
shall make the change (e.g. if the usage threshold within the
\"usageThreshold\" attribute is included in the HTTP PATCH request and
the accumulated usage report for the previously provided usage threshold
is not received yet, the SCEF shall completely replace the previously
provided one), and interact with the PCRF to modify the Rx session (as
defined in 3GPP TS 29.214 \[10\] or 3GPP TS 29.201 \[13\]). After
receiving the response from the PCRF, the SCEF shall send an HTTP
response to the SCS/AS with a corresponding status code and include the
result in the body of the HTTP response.

NOTE 4: The SCS/AS can assume a successful resource allocation upon
receipt of the POST/PUT/PATCH response, until the
FAILED\_RESOURCES\_ALLOCATION event is received.

If the SCEF receives a traffic plane notification (e.g. the usage
threshold is reached or transmission resource lost), or if the SCEF gets
informed that the Rx session is terminated (e.g. due to a release of PDN
connection), the SCEF shall send an HTTP POST message including the
notified event (e.g. session terminated) and the accumulated usage (if
received from the PCRF) to the callback URI \"notificationUri\" provided
by the SCS/AS during the creation of individual AS Session with Required
QoS Subscription. The SCS/AS shall respond with an HTTP response to
confirm the received notification.

In order to remove the established AS session, the SCS/AS shall send an
HTTP DELETE message to the SCEF for the \"Individual AS Session with
Required QoS Subscription\" resource. After receiving the HTTP DELETE
message, the SCEF shall remove all properties and interact with the PCRF
to terminate the Rx session (as defined in 3GPP TS 29.214 \[10\] or
3GPP TS 29.201 \[13\]). After receiving the response from the PCRF, the
SCEF shall send an HTTP response to the SCS/AS with a corresponding
status code and include the accumulated usage (if received from the
PCRF).

### 4.4.14 Procedures for MSISDN-less Mobile Originated SMS

#### 4.4.14.1 General

The procedures are used by the SCEF to send the MSISDN-less MO-SMS to
the SCS/AS via T8 interface.

#### 4.4.14.2 Delivery of MSISDN-less MO SMS

If the SCEF receives an MSISDN-less MO-SMS via T4 including an
destination SME address (long/short code of the SCS/AS), the SCEF will
use the IMSI of the UE and application port ID received over T4 to query
the HSS/HLR for an external ID, and the SCEF shall then determine the
notification destination URL of an SCS/AS based on configured
information on the mapping of SME addresses to destination URLs. The
SCEF shall send to the determined destination URL an HTTP POST request
that shall include an MsisdnLessMoSmsNotification data type with:

\- the short message transfer protocol data unit as received on the T4
interface.

\- the Application Port as received on the T4 interface, and

\- the external identifier of the UE that send the SMS, as received from
the HSS/HLR.

NOTE: The Notification Delivery using Websocket (see subclause 5.2.5.4)
and the Notification Test Event (see subclause 5.2.5.3) are not
supported for the present API.

### 4.4.15 Procedures for RACS Parameter Provisioning

The procedures are used by an SCS/AS to request that the network to
provision manufacturer specific UE radio capability information.

In order to create a new parameter provisioning, the SCS/AS shall send
an HTTP POST request message to the SCEF to the resource \"RACS
Parameter Provisionings\". The body of the HTTP POST request message
shall include a list of RACS IDs, and for each provided RACS ID, its
radio capability parameters and the related UE model(s) IMEI-TAC
value(s).

In order to fully replace an existing RACS Parameter Provisioning, the
SCS/AS may send an HTTP PUT message to the resource \"Individual RACS
Parameter Provisioning\" requesting the SCEF to change all properties in
the existing resource. The body of the HTTP PUT request message shall
include a list of RACS IDs, and for each provided RACS ID, its radio
capability parameters and the related UE model(s) IMEI-TAC value(s).

In order to partial update an existing RACS Parameter Provisioning, the
SCS/AS may send an HTTP PATCH message to the resource \"Individual RACS
Parameter Provisioning\" requesting the SCEF to change some properties
in the existing resource.

Upon receipt of the HTTP POST, PUT or PATCH message, if the SCS/AS is
authorized to perform the request, the SCEF shall interact with the UCMF
as described in 3GPP TS 29.675 \[61\]. After receiving the response from
the UCMF, if at least one RACS ID is succesfully provisioned, the SCEF
shall create or update the resource \"Individual RACS Parameter
Provisioning\" and respond with 201 Created or 200 OK to the SCS/AS
respectively with the successfully provisioned RACS information, the
SCEF may include RACS report(s) within attribute \"racsReports\" with a
list of RACS ID(s) and the corresponding failure code for which the
provisioning has failed as specified in table 5.16.2.2.3-1 in the body
of the HTTP response. Otherwise, the SCEF shall send an HTTP response to
the SCS/AS with a corresponding failure code as described in
subclause 5.16.5.

In order to delete an existing RACS Parameter Provisioning at the SCEF,
the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP DELETE message to the corresponding
resource \"Individual RACS Parameter Provisioning\" at the SCEF. Upon
receipt of the DELETE request message, the SCEF shall interact with the
UCMF as described in 3GPP TS 29.675 \[61\]. After receiving the response
from the UCMF, the SCEF shall remove the resource and respond with 204
No Content to the SCS/AS.

#### 5.2.1.4 Conventions for documenting structured data types

The structured data types shall represent an object (see
IETF RFC 8259 \[40\]). The structured data types shall contain
attributes that are simple data types, structured data types, arrays
(see below), maps (see below) or enumerations.

An array (see IETF RFC 8259 \[40\]) shall represent a list of values
without keys and with significance in the order of sequence. All values
shall be of the same type.

A map shall represent an object (see IETF RFC 8259 \[40\]) with a list
of key-value pairs (with no significance in the order of sequence),
where all keys are of type string and shall be unique identifiers
assigned by the application rather than by the schema, and where all
values shall be of the same type.

NOTE 1: Maps are supported by the OpenAPI specification \[27\] as
described at
https://swagger.io/docs/specification/data-models/dictionaries/. Maps
can enable a faster lookup of elements identified by some key in huge
data structures compared to arrays that contain the key within the
elements. Maps can also be used instead of arrays to modify individual
elements when modification instructions of the PATCH method are
compliant to IETF RFC 7396 \[39\].

Each structured data type shall be specified in a separate subclause as
illustrated in table 5.2.1.4-1.

Table 5.2.1.4-1: Definition of type \<Data type\>

  ---------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------- ------------------------
  Attribute name         Data type                                                        Cardinality                         Description
  \<*attribute name*\>   \"*\<type\>*\" or \"array*(\<type\>*)\" or \"map*(\<type\>*)\"   \"0..1\", \"1\", or \"*M*..*N*\",   \<only if applicable\>
  ---------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------- ------------------------

**Attribute name**: Name of attributes that belong to the specified data
type.

**Data type**: Data type of the attribute. If the data type is indicated
as \"*\<type\>*\", the attribute shall be of data type *\<type\>.* If
the data type is indicated as \"array(*\<type\>*)\", the attribute shall
be an array (see IETF RFC 8259 \[40\]) that contains elements of data
type *\<type\>*. If the data type is indicated as \"map (*\<type\>*)\",
the attribute shall be an object (see IETF RFC 8259 \[40\]) encoding a
map (see OpenAPI specification \[27\]) that contains as values elements
of data type *\<type\>*. *\<type\>* can either be \"integer\",
\"number\", \"string\" or \"boolean\" (as defined in the
OpenAPI specification \[27\]), or a data type defined in a 3GPP
specification.

**Cardinality**: Defines the allowed number of occurrence of data type
\<type\>. A cardinality of \"M..N\", is only allowed for data types
\"array(\<type\>)\" and \"map(\<type\>)\" and indicates the number of
elements within the array or map; the values M and N can either be the
characters \"M\" and \"N\", respectively, or integer numbers with M
being greater than or equal 0, and N being greater than 1 and M, For
data type \"\<type\>\", the cardinality shall be set to \"0..1\" or
\"1\". A lower boundary of \"0\" for the cardinality also indicates that
the attribute is optional. A lower boundary of \"0\" for the cardinality
indicates that the attribute is optional.

NOTE 2: The \"0..N\" implies the array or map type of the attribute may
be optional. If the attribute is present, the minimum number of elements
is described in openAPI file.

**Description**: Describes the meaning and use of the attribute and may
contain normative statements.

### 5.2.2 Usage of HTTP

#### 5.2.2.1 General

For T8 APIs, support of HTTP/1.1 (IETF RFC 7230 \[16\],
IETF RFC 7231 \[17\], IETF RFC 7232 \[18\], IETF RFC 7233 \[19\],
IETF RFC 7234 \[20\] and IETF RFC 7235 \[21\]) over TLS
(IETF RFC 5246 \[4\]) is mandatory and support of HTTP/2
(IETF RFC 7540 \[22\]) over TLS (IETF RFC 5246 \[4\]) is recommended. An
SCS/AS desiring to use HTTP/2 shall use the HTTP upgrade mechanism to
negotiate applicable HTTP version as described in IETF RFC 7540 \[22\].

#### 5.2.2.2 Usage of the HTTP PATCH method

The HTTP PATCH method, as defined in IETF RFC 5789 \[38\], allows for a
partial update of previously sent data, e.g. resources. For a complete
replacement of previously sent data, the HTTP PUT method is used. It is
defined separately for each resource whether the HTTP PUT and/or the
HTTP PATCH are applicable.

If the HTTP PATCH method is used, the JSON bodies within the PATCH
request shall be encoded according to \"JSON Merge Patch\", as defined
in IETF RFC 7396 \[39\].

NOTE: JSON merge patch is not able to modify individual elements of an
array. This is not required in the present release.

### 5.2.3 Content type

The bodies of HTTP request and successful HTTP responses shall be
encoded in JSON format (see IETF RFC 8259 \[5\]).

The MIME media type that shall be used within the related Content-Type
header field is \"application/json\", as defined in IETF RFC 8259 \[5\].

JSON object used in the HTTP PATCH request shall be encoded according to
\"JSON Merge Patch\" and shall be signalled by the content type
\"application/merge-patch+json\", as defined in IETF RFC 7396 \[39\].

\"Problem Details\" JSON object shall be used to indicate additional
details of the error in a HTTP response body and shall be signalled by
the content type \"application/problem+json\", as defined in
IETF RFC 7807 \[8\].

NOTE: This release only supports the content type JSON.

### 5.2.4 URI structure

All API URIs of T8 APIs shall be:

**{apiRoot}/\<apiName\>/\<apiVersion\>/**

\"apiRoot\" is configured by means outside the scope of the present
document. \"apiName\" and \"apiVersion\" shall be set dependent on the
API, as defined in the corresponding subclauses below. All resource URIs
in the subclauses below are defined relative to the above root API URI.

NOTE 1: The \"apiVersion\" will only be increased if the new API version
contains not backward compatible changes. Otherwise, the supported
feature mechanism defined in subclause 5.2.7 can instead be used to
negotiate extensions.

NOTE 2: A different root structure can be used when the Resource URI is
preconfigured in the SCS/AS.

The root structure may be followed by \"apiSpecificSuffixes\" that are
dependent on the API and are defined separately for each API as resource
URI where they apply:

**{apiRoot}/\<apiName\>/\<apiVersion\>/\<apiSpecificSuffixes\>**

### 5.2.5 Notifications

#### 5.2.5.1 General

The SCEF and SCS/AS shall support the delivery of Notifications using a
separate HTTP connection towards an address assigned by the SCS/AS, as
described in subclause 5.2.5.2.

An SCEF and SCS/AS may support testing a notification connection as
described in subclause 5.2.5.3. An SCEF and SCS/AS may support the
delivery of Notification using Websocket (IETF RFC 6455 \[32\]) as
described in subclause 5.2.5.4.

#### 5.2.5.2 Notification Delivery using a separate HTTP connection

If a delivery of notifications is required for an API, the SCS/AS shall
provide a notification destination URI, which designates to the SCEF
where the SCEF shall send the HTTP Notifications. This URI is provided
within an attribute (e.g. \"notificationDestination\", \"notifUri\",
\"notificationUri\") defined in the data types that are passed in a
request to create a resource that represents a subscription to
notifications, unless it is specified for that API that a preconfigured
destination address is used.

The SCS/AS may provide the same notification destination URI for several
subscriptions, and the SCEF should then use the same HTTP connection to
deliver related notifications.

The SCEF shall take the role of the HTTP client on the HTTP connection
for the delivery of Notifications. Subclause 5.2.2 shall also apply for
this HTTP connection with the exception that an SCEF (rather than an
SCS/AS) desiring to use HTTP/2 shall use the HTTP upgrade mechanism to
negotiate applicable HTTP version.

#### 5.2.5.3 Notification Test Event

If the optional \"Notification\_test\_event\" feature is supported, the
SCS/AS may test whether notifications can be received by subscribing to
the notification of a test event by providing a
\"requestTestNotification\" attribute set to \"true\" in the HTTP
request to create or update a subscription for notifications. In any
other HTTP request or response, this attribute shall retain the value
that was provided upon subscription resource creation.

Upon receiving the \"requestTestNotification\" attribute as part of a
subscription creation or update request, the SCEF shall send immediately
after establishing the notification delivery mechanism a test
notification containing a body formatted according to the
\"TestNotification\" data type as defined in subclause 5.2.1.2.12. If
the SCS/AS does not receive the test notification within a configured
time, the SCS/AS knows that the notification delivery with the selected
method is not possible and may take corrective actions.

#### 5.2.5.4 Notification Delivery using Websocket

The procedures in the present subclause only apply if SCS/AS and SCEF
support the \"Notification\_websocket\" feature. If the feature
\"Notification\_websocket\" is supported, then the feature
\"Notification\_test\_event\" shall also be supported.

If a delivery of notifications is required for an API and the SCS/AS
does not know from previous interactions with the SCEF whether delivery
of notifications over a separate HTTP connection works, the SCS/AS
should initially request the SCEF to try to establish a separate HTTP
connection for notification delivery according to subclause 5.2.5.2 by
providing a URI to the SCEF designating where to send HTTP
Notifications, and shall also subscribe to the notification of a test
event as in subclause 5.2.5.3.

If the SCS/AS does not receive the requested notification of the test
event during a configured period after the subscription, the SCS/AS may
configure the subscription to request the SCEF to provide a URI for an
HTTP connection to upgrade to Websocket, setting the
\"requestWebsocketUri\" attribute to \"true\" as specified in
subclause 5.2.1.2.13. The SCS/AS may also request the SCEF to provide a
URI in a new subscription creation request, and should in this case
terminate the original subscription.

NOTE 1: If the SCS/AS has requested the delivery of notifications to a
separate entity, it needs to be informed by that separate entity about
the receipt of the test notification. That communication between the
separate entity and the SCS/AS is out of scope of the present document.

When the SCEF receives a subscription creation or update request to use
Websockets to deliver notifications (i.e. with the
\"requestWebsocketUri\" attribute set to \"true\"), it shall assign a
Websocket URI where to receive a Websocket connection establishment and
provide this URI in the \"websocketUri\" attribute in the response, as
defined in subclause 5.1.2.1.13. Once such Websocket URI has been
assigned for a particular subscription resource, subsequent update
requests to this resource that ask for the assignment of a new Websocket
URI for that subscription shall be rejected by the SCEF.

Upon the reception of the Websocket URI from the SCEF in the
\"websocketUri\" attribute, as specified in subclause 5.2.1.2.13-1, in
the subscription creation or subscription update response, the SCS/AS or
a separate entity that is intended to receive the notification shall
establish an HTTP connection towards that URI and shall upgrade that
connection to the Websocket protocol (IETF RFC 6455 \[32\]) using the
HTTP upgrade mechanism defined in IETF RFC 7230 \[16\].

NOTE 2: For delivery of Notifications to a separate entity, the SCS/AS
needs to provide the Websocket URI to that separate entity. That
communication between the SCS/AS and the separate entity is out of scope
of the present document.

The following framing of the request and response shall be used when
delivering a notification or acknowledging its delivery through
Websockets.

NOTE 3: The framing is aligned as much as possible with HTTP delivery in
order to simplify implementations.

To deliver a notification towards the SCS/AS, the SCEF shall embed the
following structure in a separate Websocket data frame with 0x2 (Binary)
opcode in the following order:

1\) The string \"3GPP-WS-Notif-Seq:\", followed by a blank, followed by
a four-byte sequence number, encoded as decimal number in ASCII,
followed by CRLF

2\) The following HTTP headers in any order, with the syntax and
semantics as defined in IETF RFC 7230 \[16\] and IETF RFC 7231 \[17\]:
Content-Type (mandatory), Content-Encoding (optional), Content-Length
(mandatory). Every HTTP header line shall be ended by CRLF.

3\) CRLF to end the headers section.

4\) The payload body of the notification, as defined in the individual
APIs.

NOTE 4: The payload body is the same as the one that would be used if
delivering the notification as defined in subclause 5.2.5.3.

To acknowledge the reception of a notification message towards the SCEF,
the SCS/AS shall embed the following structure in a separate Websocket
data frame with 0x2 (Binary) opcode in the following order:

1\) The string \"3GPP-WS-Notif-Seq:\", followed by a blank, followed by
the four-byte sequence number of the notification to be confirmed,
encoded as decimal number in ASCII, followed by CRLF.

2\) The HTTP status code (e.g. 204) and status message (e.g. No Content)
as defined for HTTP delivery of the notification in the individual APIs,
separated by a single blank character, and ended by CRLF.

3\) Conditionally, as defined in IETF RFC 7230 \[16\] and
IETF RFC 7231 \[17\], the following HTTP headers in any order:
Content-Type, Content-Encoding, and Content-Length. Every HTTP header
line shall be ended by CRLF.

4\) CRLF to end the headers section.

5\) The payload body of the response, if applicable based on the status
code and the HTTP headers, as defined in IETF RFC 7230 \[16\] and
IETF RFC 7231 \[17\].

NOTE 5: The status code, the status message and the payload body (if
applicable), are the same as if delivering the notification as defined
in subclause 5.2.5.3.

Use of CRLF is defined in IETF RFC 7230 \[16\].

The SCEF need not wait for the confirmation of each notification before
delivering the next notification. The SCEF shall determine whether a
notification has been delivered successfully by correlating the sent
notification with the received acknowledgement by checking the sequence
numbers of both for equality. The SCEF may re-send a notification, using
the same sequence number, if it has not received an acknowledgement with
a matching sequence number after a configurable time-out. The SCS/AS
shall consider notifications with the same sequence number that arrive
within a configurable time interval as duplicates.

The SCS/AS should send periodic Websocket \"PING\" frames to keep the
connection alive.

NOTE 6: the TCP layer will handle a possible fragmentation and
reassembly of large messages.

The security related clause 6 shall also apply for the HTTP connection
that is upgraded to Websocket.

### 5.2.6 Error handling

Table 5.2.6-1 lists response bodies that are applicable to all APIs and
as responses for all requests in the present specification unless
otherwise specified. The HTTP client shall mandatorily support the
processing of the status code for all the applicable methods, when
received in a HTTP response message. In such cases the HTTP client shall
also support the handling of the \"ProblemDetails\" JSON object with the
Content-Type header field set to the value \"application/problem+json\",
if the corresponding API definition in the current specification does
not specify another response body for the corresponding status code.

The protocol and application errors in subclause 5.2.7.2 of
3GPP TS 29.500 \[44\] are applicable for above status codes for the APIs
defined in the present specification. Specific errors are contained in
the related API definition for each API.

### 5.2.7 Feature negotiation

The procedures in subclause 6.6.2 of 3GPP TS 29.500 \[44\] shall be
applicable for the APIs defined in the present specification with the
difference that the SCEF should not register any feature for northbound
APIs in the NRF.

The supported features are negotiated separately for each API. For each
of the APIs defined in the present specification, the applicable list of
features is contained in the related API definition.

### 5.2.8 HTTP custom headers

#### 5.2.8.1 General

This subclause lists reused HTTP custom headers and defines any new HTTP
custom headers introduced by this specification.

#### 5.2.8.2 Reused HTTP custom headers

Table 5.2.8.2-1: Reused HTTP custom headers

  ------ ----------- -------------
  Name   Reference   Description
                     
  ------ ----------- -------------

### 5.2.9 Conventions for Open API specification files

#### 5.2.9.1 General

T8 Open API specification files shall comply with the
OpenAPI specification \[27\] and with the present subclause.

Each API shall be described in one Open API specification file. In
addition, 3GPP specifications may contain Open API specification file
with common data types.

For the purpose of referencing (see subclause 5.2.9.6), it is assumed
that each Open API specification file contained in a 3GPP specification
is stored as separate physical, that all Open API specification files
are stored in the same directory on the local server, and that the files
are named according to the conventions in subclause 5.2.9.6.

#### 5.2.9.2 Formatting of OpenAPI files

The following guidelines shall be used when documenting OpenAPI files:

\- OpenAPI specifications shall be documented using YAML format (see
YAML 1.2 \[41\]). For specific restrictions on the usage of YAML in
OpenAPI, see OpenAPI 3.0.0 Specification \[27\].

\- The style used for the specification shall be \"PL\" (Programming
Language).

\- The different scopes in the YAML data structures representing
collections (objects, arrays...) shall use an indentation of two white
spaces.

\- Comments may be added by following the standard YAML syntax (\"\#\").

#### 5.2.9.3 Structured data types

The OpenAPI file shall contain a definition in the components/schemas
section defining a schema with the name of the structured data type as
key.

The schema shall contain:

\- \"type: object\";

\- If any attributes in the structured data type are marked as mandatory
via a minimum cardinality greater than \"0\", a \"required\" keyword
listing those attributes;

\- A \"properties\" keyword containing for each attribute in the
structured data type an entry with the attribute name as key and;

1\. if the data type is \"*\<type\>*\"

a\. if the data type of the attribute is \"string\", \"number\",
\"integer\", or \"boolean\", a type definition using that data type as
value (\"type: *\<data type\>*\"); or

b\. otherwise a reference to the data type schema for the data type
*\<data type\>* of the attribute, i.e. \"\$ref:
\'\#/components/schemas/*\<data type\>*\'\" if that data type schema is
contained in the same OpenAPI file and \"\$ref:
\'*\<filename\>*\#/components/schemas/*\<data type\>*\'\" if that data
type schema is contained in file *\<filename\>* in the same directory on
the same server.

2\. if the data type is \"array*(\<type\>*)\":

a\. a type definition \"type: array\";

b\. an \"items:\" definition containing

i). if the data type of the attribute is \"string\", \"number\",
\"integer\", or \"boolean\", a type definition using that data type as
value (\"type: *\<data type\>*\"); or

ii). Otherwise a reference to the data type schema for the data type
*\<data type\>* of the attribute, i.e. \"\$ref:
\'\#/components/schemas/*\<data type\>*\'\" if that data type schema is
contained in the same OpenAPI file and \"\$ref:
\'*\<filename\>*\#/components/schemas/*\<data type\>*\'\" if that data
type schema is contained in file *\<filename\>* in the same directory on
the same server.

c\. if the cardinality contained an integer value *\<m\>* as lower
boundary, \"minItems: *\<m\>*\"; and

d\. if the cardinality contained an integer value *\<n\>* as upper
boundary, \"maxItems: *\<n\>*\";

3\. if the data type is \"map*(\<type\>*)\";

a\. a type definition \"type: object\"; and

b\. an \"additionalProperties:\" definition containing

i). if the data type of the attribute is \"string\", \"number\",
\"integer\", or \"boolean\", a type definition using that data type as
value (\"type: *\<data type\>*\"); or

ii). Otherwise a reference to the data type schema for the data type
*\<data type\>* of the attribute, i.e. \"\$ref:
\'\#/components/schemas/*\<data type\>*\'\" if that data type schema is
contained in the same OpenAPI file and \"\$ref:
\'*\<filename\>*\#/components/schemas/*\<data type\>*\'\" if that data
type schema is contained in file *\<filename\>* in the same directory on
the same server.

c\. if the cardinality contained an integer value *\<m\>* as lower
boundary, \"min Properties: *\<m\>*\"; and

d\. if the cardinality contained an integer value *\<n\>* as upper
boundary, \"max Properties: *\<n\>*\";

4\. \"description: *\<description\>*\", where *\<description\>* is the
description of the attribute in the table defining the structured data
type.

NOTE 1: An omission of the \"minProperties\", and \"maxProperties\"
keywords indicates that no lower or upper boundaries respectively, for
the number of properties in an object are defined. An omission of the
\"minItems\", and \"maxItems\" keywords indicates that no lower or upper
boundaries, respectively, for the number of items in an array are
defined.

NOTE 2: The \"0..N\" implies the array or map type of the attribute may
be optional. If the attribute is present, the minimum number of elements
is described in openAPI file.

Example:

Table 5.2.9.3-1: Definition of type ExampleStructuredType

  ----------------- ------------------ ------------- ---------------------------------------
  Attribute name    Data type          Cardinality   Description
  exSimple          ExSimple           1             exSimple attribute description
  exArrayElements   array(string)      1..10         exArrayElements attribute description
  exMapElements     map(ExStructure)   1..N          exMapElements attribute description
  ----------------- ------------------ ------------- ---------------------------------------

The data structure in table 5.2.9.3-1 is described in an OpenAPI file as
follows:

components:

schemas:

ExampleStructuredType:

type: object

required:

\- exSimple

\- exMapElements

properties:

exSimple:

\$ref: \'\#/components/schemas/ExSimple\'

description: exSimple attribute description

exArrayElements:

type: array

items:

type: string

minItems: 1

maxItems: 10

description: exArrayElements attribute description

exMapElements:

type: object

additionalProperties:

\$ref: \'\#/components/schemas/ExStructure\'

minProperties: 1

description: exMapElements attribute description

#### 5.2.9.4 Info

The Open API specification file of an API shall contain an \"info\"
field with the title and version as defined in subclause 4.3 of
3GPP TS 29.501 \[49\].

#### 5.2.9.5 Servers

As defined in subclause 5.2.4, the base URI of an API consists of
**{apiRoot}/\<apiName\>/\<apiVersion\>**. It shall be encoded in the
corresponding Open API specification file as \"servers\" field with
**{apiRoot}** as variable.

Example:

servers:

\- url: \'{apiRoot}/3gpp-yyyy/v1\'

variables:

apiRoot:

default: https://demohost.com

description: apiRoot as defined in subclause 5.2.4 of 3GPP TS 29.122.

#### 5.2.9.6 References to other 3GPP-defined Open API specification files

For the purpose of referencing, it shall be assumed that each Open API
specification file contained in a 3GPP specification is stored as
separate physical file, that all Open API specification files are stored
in the same directory on the local server, and that the files are named
according to the following convention: The file name shall consist of
(in the order below):

\- the 3GPP specification number in the format \"Tsxxyyy\";

\- an \"\_\" character;

\- if the OpenAPI specification file contains an API definition, the API
name as defined for corresponding base URL parts (see subclause 4.4) of
that API.

\- if the OpenAPI specification file contains a definition of
CommonData, the string \"CommonData\"; and

\- the string \".yaml\".

Examples:

Reference to Data Type \"Xxx\" defined in the same file

\$ref: \'\#/components/schemas/Xxx\'

Reference to Data Type \"Xxx\" defined as Common Data in 3GPP TS 29.122:

\$ref: \'TS29122\_CommonData.yaml\#/components/schemas/Xxx\'

Reference to Data Type \"Xxx\" defined within API \"Nxxx\_Yyy\" in
3GPP TS ab.cde:

\$ref: \'Tsabcde\_Nxxx\_Yyy.yaml\#/components/schemas/Xxx\'

#### 5.2.9.7 Server-initiated communication

If an API contains notifications as described in subclause 5.2.5, it
should be described as \"callback\" in Open API specification files.

Example:

paths:

/subscriptions:

post:

requestBody:

required: true

content:

application/json:

schema:

type: object

properties:

callbackUrl: \# Callback URL

type: string

format: uri

responses:

\'201\':

description: Success

callbacks:

myNotification: \# arbitrary name

\'{\$request.body\#/callbackUrl}\': \# refers The callback URL in the
POST

post:

requestBody: \# Contents of the callback message

required: true

content:

application/json:

schema:

\$ref: \'\#/components/schemas/NotificationBody\'

responses: \# Expected responses to the callback message

\'200\':

description: xxx

#### 5.2.9.8 Describing the body of HTTP PATCH requests

In the OpenAPI file, the content field key of the Request Body Object
shall contain \"application/merge-patch+json\". The content field value
is a Media Type Object identifying the applicable patch body Schema
Object. The patch body Schema Object may contain structured data types
derived from the data types used in the schema to describe a complete
representation of the resource in such a manner that attributes that are
allowed to be modified are listed in the \"properties\" validation
keyword.

NOTE 1: A derived structured data type is beneficial if the data types
used to describe a complete representation of the resource contains
mandatory attributes, if attributes are allowed to be removed by the
PATCH operation, or if a checking by the OpenAPI tooling that only
allowed modifications are done via the \"additionalProperties: false\"
keyword is desired. It also provides a clear description in the OpenAPI
file to developers which modifications need to be supported.

As an alternative, the data types used in the schema to describe a
complete representation of the resource may be used if any attributes
that are allowed to be removed are marked as \"nullable: true\" in that
schema.

Any attributes that are allowed to be removed shall be marked as
\"nullable: true\" in the patch body Schema Object.

The \"additionalProperties: false\" keyword may be set.

NOTE 2: The \"additionalProperties: false\" keyword enables the OpenAPI
tooling to check that only allowed modifications are done. Extensions of
the object in future releases are still possible under the assumption
that the supported features mechanism is used to negotiate the usage of
any new attribute prior to the PATCH invocation. If new optional
attributes are expected to be introduced without corresponding supported
feature or if PATCH can be used as first operation in an API, the usage
of the \"additionalProperties: false\" keyword is not appropriate.

#### 5.2.9.9 Error Responses

As described in subclause 5.2.6, T8 APIs use valid HTTP response codes
as error codes in HTTP responses and may include a \"ProblemDetails\"
data structure specified in subclause 5.2.1.2.12 or an
application-specific data structure.

Subclause 5.2.6 specifies HTTP status code per HTTP method. OpenAPI
files should include at least the status codes in that table.

For the purpose of referencing, HTTP error responses with
\"ProblemDetails\" data structure are specified as part of the
CommonData OpenAPI file in Annex A.2.

Example:

In the example below, the 400, and 500 and default error response
descriptions are referenced.

Paths:

/users:

get:

responses:

\'200\':

content:

application/json

schema:

\$ref: \'\#/components/schemas/ExampleGetBody\'

\'400\':

\$ref: \'TS29122\_CommonData.yaml\#/components/responses/400\'

\'500\':

\$ref: \'TS29122\_CommonData.yaml\#/components/responses/500\'

default:

\$ref: \'TS29122\_CommonData.yaml\#/components/responses/default\'

The following definitions provided in Annex A.2 are used in that
example:

components:

responses:

\'400\':

description: Bad request

content:

application/problem+json:

schema:

\$ref: \'\#/components/schemas/ProblemDetails\'

\'500\':

description: Internal Server Error

content:

application/problem+json:

schema:

\$ref: \'\#/components/schemas/ProblemDetails\'

default:

description: Generic Error

#### 5.2.9.10 Enumerations

For enumerations, the OpenAPI file shall contain a definition in the
components/schemas section defining a schema with the name of the
enumeration as key.

The schema

\- shall contain the \"anyOf\" keyword listing as alternatives:

1\. the \"type: string\" keyword and the \"enum\" keyword with a list of
all defined values for the enumeration; and

2\. the \"type: string\" keyword and the \"description\" keyword with a
description stating that the string is only provided for extensibility
and is not used to encode contents defined in the present version of the
specification. And

\- may contain a description listing the defined values of the
enumeration together with explanations of those values.

NOTE: The \"enum\" keyword restricts the permissible values of the
string to the enumerated ones. This can lead to extensibility problems
when new values need to be introduced.

Example:

Table 5.2.9.10-1: Enumeration ExampleEnumeration

  ------------------- ----------------------- ---------------
  Enumeration value   Description             Applicability
  One                 Value One description   
  Two                 Value Two description   
  ------------------- ----------------------- ---------------

The data structure in table 5.2.9.10-1 is described in an OpenAPI file
as follows:

components:

schemas:

ExampleEnumeration:

anyOf:

\- type: string

enum:

\- One

\- Two

\- type: string

description: \>

This string provides forward-compatibility with future

extensions to the enumeration but is not used to encode

content defined in the present version of this API.

Description: \>

Possible values are

\- One: Value One description

\- Two: Value Two description

#### 5.2.9.11 Read only attribute

Each OpenAPI specification should include \"readOnly: true\" for those
attributes that are only provided by the SCEF in the HTTP response
message to prevent the SCS/AS from provisioning those attributes which
is not expected, if the write and read operations (e.g. POST request and
response) share the same data type which contains those attributes.

Example:

NiddStatus:

anyOf:

\- type: string

enum:

\- ACTIVE

\- TERMINATED\_UE\_NOT\_AUTHORIZED

\- TERMINATED

\- type: string

description: \>

This string provides forward-compatibility with future

extensions to the enumeration but is not used to encode

content defined in the present version of this API.

Description: \>

Possible values are

\- ACTIVE: The NIDD configuration is active.

\- TERMINATED\_UE\_NOT\_AUTHORIZED: The NIDD configuration was
terminated because the UE´s authorisation was revoked.

\- TERMINATED: The NIDD configuration was terminated.

readOnly: true

#### 5.2.9.12 externalDocs

Each OpenAPI specification shall provide in an \"externalDoc\" field the
reference to the 3GPP TS describing the API, as illustrated below.

Example:

externalDocs

description: 3GPP TS 29.122 V15.1.0 T8 reference point for Northbound
APIs

url: http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/29\_series/29.122/

### 5.2.10 Redirection handling

An HTTP request may be redirected to a different target entity.

Upon receipt of an HTTP request from the SCS/AS, when the SCEF redirects
the HTTP request to a different target SCEF, the URI of the target SCEF
towards which the request is redirected shall be given by the Location
header field of the \"307 Temporary Redirect\" or \"308 Permanent
Redirect\" response. The SCS/AS should then send the HTTP request
towards the new target SCEF.

Upon receipt of a notification/callback request from the SCEF, when the
SCS/AS redirects the notification/callback request to a different target
SCS/AS, the URI of the target SCS/AS towards which the
notification/callback request is redirected shall be given by the
Location header field of the \"307 Temporary Redirect\" or \"308
Permanent Redirect\" response. The SCEF should then send the HTTP
request towards the new target SCS/AS.

5.3 MonitoringEvent API
-----------------------

### 5.3.1 Overview

The MonitoringEvent API is a RESTful API that allows the SCS/AS to
subscribe to notifications about specific events in 3GPP networks. It
also allows the SCEF to report the event by sending notifications to the
authorised users when the corresponding event is detected. The API also
allows the SCEF to indicate the removal of a previously configured
monitoring request. The MonitoringEvent API defines a set of data
models, resources and the related procedures for the creation and
management of monitoring event subscriptions. The corresponding JSON
schema for the representation of the resources and operations defined by
the MonitoringEvent API is provided in its complete form in Annex A.3.

### 5.3.2 Data model

#### 5.3.2.1 Resource data types

##### 5.3.2.1.1 Introduction

This clause defines data structures to be used in resource
representations, including subscription resources.

Table 5.3.2.1.1-1 specifies data types re-used by the MonitoringEvent
API from other specifications, including a reference to their respective
specifications and when needed, a short description of their use within
the MonitoringEvent API.

background data transfer request. The corresponding JSON schema for the
representation of the resources and operations defined by the
ResourceManagementOfBdt API is provided in its complete form in
Annex A.4.

### 5.4.2 Data model

5.5 ChargeableParty API
-----------------------

### 5.5.1 Overview

The ChargeableParty API is a RESTful API that allows the SCS/AS to
either request to sponsor the traffic from the beginning or to request
becoming the chargeable party at a later point in time via the T8
interface. The ChargeableParty API defines a set of data models,
resources and the related procedures for the creation and management of
the AS sessions with chargeable party change. The corresponding JSON
schema for the representation of the resources and operations defined by
the Chargeable API is provided in its complete form in Annex A.5.

### 5.5.2 Data model

#### 5.5.2.1 Resource data types

##### 5.5.2.1.1 Introduction

This clause defines data structures to be used in resource
representations.

Table 5.5.2.1.1-1 specifies data types re-used by the ChargeableParty
API from other specifications, including a reference to their respective
specifications and when needed, a short description of their use within
the ChargeableParty API.

5.6 NIDD API
------------

### 5.6.1 Overview

The NIDD API is a RESTful API that allows the SCS/AS to send non-IP data
to the UE or receive non-IP data from the UE. The NIDD API defines a set
of data models, resources and the related procedures for the non-IP data
transfer. The corresponding JSON schema for the representation of the
resources and operations defined by the NIDD API is provided in its
complete form in Annex A.6.

### 5.6.2 Data model

#### 5.6.2.1 Resource data types

##### 5.6.2.1.1 Introduction

This clause defines data structures to be used in resource
representations, including subscription resources.

Table 5.6.2.1.1-1 specifies data types re-used by the NIDD API from
other specifications, including a reference to their respective
specifications and when needed, a short description of their use within
the NIDD API.

5.7 DeviceTriggering API
------------------------

### 5.7.1 Overview

The DeviceTriggering API is a RESTful API that allows the SCS/AS to
deliver specific device trigger to the SCEF; it allows the SCS/AS to
replace or recall the pending device trigger via the SCEF. If the
corresponding device trigger delivery report is received by the SCEF, it
also allows the SCEF to indicate the trigger delivery result to the
SCS/AS.

The DeviceTriggering API defines a set of data models, resources and the
related procedure for the creation and management of the device
triggering. The corresponding JSON schema for the representation of the
resources and operations defined by the DeviceTriggering API is provided
in its complete form in Annex A.7.

### 5.7.2 Data model

#### 5.7.2.1 Resource data types

##### 5.7.2.1.1 Introduction

This clause defines data structures to be used in resource
representations, including subscription resources.

Table 5.7.2.1.1-1 specifies data types re-used by the DeviceTriggering
API from other specifications, including a reference to their respective
specifications and when needed, a short description of their use within
the DeviceTriggering API.

###### 5.7.3.3.3.2 PUT

A pending device triggering delivery can be replaced by the SCS/AS. To
replace the pending device triggering, the SCS/AS shall use the HTTP PUT
method on the \"transaction\" instance resource as follows:

> \- the body of the message is encoded in JSON format with the data
> structure defined in table 5.7.2.1.2-1

The properties \"msisdn\" or \"externalId\" shall remain unchanged from
previously provided value.

The possible response messages from the SCEF, depending on whether the
PUT request is successful or unsuccessful, are shown in Table
5.7.3.3.3.2-1.

5.8 GMD via MBMS related APIs
-----------------------------

### 5.8.1 Overview

There are two Group Message Delivery via MBMS related APIs defined:

\- GMDviaMBMSbyMB2 API;

\- GMDviaMBMSbyxMB API.

Both APIs are RESTful APIs that allow the SCS/AS to deliver the group
message to the SCEF. They define a set of data models, resources and the
related procedures for the creation and management of the group message
delivery. The corresponding JSON schema for the representation of the
resources and operations defined by the GMDviaMBMSbyMB2 API and
GMDviaMBMSbyxMB API are provided in its complete form in Annex A.8.1 and
Annex A.8.2, respectively.

####### 5.8.3.2.5.3.2 PUT

Assuming that a group message delivery has been created using the HTTP
POST method described in subclause 5.8.3.2.4.3.4, replace of its
properties can be performed by the SCS/AS by using the HTTP PUT method
on the \"delivery-via-mbms\" instance resource as follows:

\- the body of the message is encoded in JSON format with the data
structure defined in table 5.8.3.1.1.3-1.

The content body of the group message delivery via MBMS update request
shall contain updated full representation of the group message delivery
resource. Only the properties \"locationinfo\", \"accuracy\",
\"messageDeliverystarttime\", \"messageDeliverystoptime\" and
\"groupMessagepayload\" can be modified.

The possible response messages from the SCEF, depending on whether the
PUT request is successful or unsuccessful, are shown in Table
5.8.3.2.5.3.2-1.

5.9 ReportingNetworkStatus API
------------------------------

### 5.9.1 Overview

The ReportingNetworkStatus API is a RESTful API that allows the SCS/AS
to be one-time or continuous notified of the network status in a
geographic area. The ReportingNetworkStatus API defines a set of data
models, resources and the related procedures for the creation and
management of the network status reporting request. The corresponding
JSON schema for the representation of the resources and operations
defined by the ReportingNetworkStatus API is provided in its complete
form in Annex A.9.

### 5.9.2 Data model

#### 5.9.2.1 Resource data types

##### 5.9.2.1.1 Introduction

This clause defines data structures to be used in resource
representations.

Table 5.9.2.1.1-1 specifies data types re-used by the
ReportingNetworkStatus API from other specifications, including a
reference to their respective specifications and when needed, a short
description of their use within the ReportingNetworkStatus API.

5.11 PfdManagement API
----------------------

### 5.11.1 Overview

The PfdManagement API allows the SCS/AS to manage the PFDs via the SCEF.
The PfdManagement API defines a set of data models, resources and the
related procedures for the creation and management of the PFD management
request. The corresponding JSON schema for the representation of the
resources and operations defined by the PfdManagement API is provided in
its complete form in Annex A.11.

### 5.11.2 Data model

#### 5.11.2.1 Resource data types

##### 5.11.2.1.1 Introduction

This clause defines data structures to be used in resource
representations.

Table 5.11.2.1.1-1 specifies data types re-used by the PfdManagement API
from other specifications, including a reference to their respective
specifications and when needed, a short description of their use within
the PfdManagement API.

5.12 ECRControl API
-------------------

### 5.12.1 Overview

The ECRControl API is a custom API (RPC interaction) that allows the
SCS/AS to query or configure the enhanced converage restriction over
3GPP networks. The ECRControl API defines a set of data models and
related custom operation procedures for the enhanced coverage
restriction control request. The corresponding JSON schema for the
representation of the operations defined by the ECRControl API is
provided in its complete form in Annex A.12.

### 5.12.2 Data model

#### 5.12.2.1 Data types

##### 5.12.2.1.1 Introduction

This clause defines data structures to be used in the request and
response.

Table 5.12.2.1.1-1 specifies data types re-used by the ECRControl API
from other specifications, including a reference to their respective
specifications and when needed, a short description of their use within
the ECRControl API.

5.13 NpConfiguration API
------------------------

### 5.13.1 Overview

The NpConfiguration API is a RESTful API that allows the SCS/AS to send
suggested network parameters to influence certain aspects of UE/network
behaviour such as the UE\'s PSM, extended idle mode DRX, and extended
buffering configurations. The NpConfiguration API defines a set of data
models, resources and the related procedures for the creation and
management of the network parameter configuration. The corresponding
JSON schema for the representation of the resources and operations
defined by the NpConfiguration API is provided in its complete form in
Annex A.13.

### 5.13.2 Data model

#### 5.13.2.1 Resource data types

##### 5.13.2.1.1 Introduction

This clause defines data structures to be used in resource
representations.

Table 5.13.2.1.1-1 specifies data types re-used by the
NetworkParameterConfiguration API from other specifications, including a
reference to their respective specifications and when needed, a short
description of their use within the NetworkParameterConfiguration API.

5.14 AsSessionWithQoS API
-------------------------

### 5.14.1 Overview

The AsSessionWithQoS API is a RESTful API that allows the SCS/AS to set
up a session with SCEF with required QoS based on the application and
service requirement. The AsSessionWithQoS API defines a set of data
models, resources and the related procedures for the creation and
management of the AS sessions with required QoS. The corresponding JSON
schema for the representation of the resources and operations defined by
the AsSessionWithQoS API is provided in its complete form in Annex A.14.

### 5.14.2 Data model

#### 5.14.2.1 Resource data types

##### 5.14.2.1.1 Introduction

This clause defines data structures to be used in resource
representations, including subscription resources.

Table 5.14.2.1.1-1 specifies data types re-used by the AsSessionWithQoS
API from other specifications, including a reference to their respective
specifications and when needed, a short description of their use within
the AsSessionWithQoS API.

### 5.16.1 Overview

The RacsParameterProvisioning API is a RESTful API that allows the
SCS/AS to provision manufacturer specific UE radio capability
parameters. The RacsParameterProvisioning API defines a set of data
models, resources and the related procedures for the creation and
management of the parameters. The corresponding JSON schema for the
representation of the resources and operations defined by the
RacsParameterProvisioning API is provided in its complete form in
Annex A.16.

### 5.16.5 Error handling

#### 5.16.5.1 General

HTTP error handling shall be supported as specified in subclause 5.2.6.

In addition, the requirements in the following subclauses shall apply.

#### 5.16.5.2 Protocol Errors

In this release of the specification, there are no additional protocol
errors applicable for the RacsParameterProvisioning API.

#### 5.16.5.3 Application Errors

The application errors defined for the RacsParameterProvisioning API are
listed in table 5.16.5.3-1. The SCEF shall include in the HTTP status
code a \"ProblemDetails\" data structure with the \"cause\" attribute
indicating the application error as listed in table 5.16.5.3-1.

Table 5.16.5.3-1: Application errors

  ------------------- ------------------ -------------
  Application Error   HTTP status code   Description
                                         
  ------------------- ------------------ -------------

6 Security
==========

TLS (IETF RFC 5246 \[4\]) shall be used to support the security
communication between the SCEF and the SCS/AS over T8 as defined in
subclause 5.5 of 3GPP TS 33.187 \[35\]. The access to the SCEF
northbound APIs shall be authorized by means of OAuth2 protocol (see
IETF RFC 6749 \[51\]), based on local configuration, using the \"Client
Credentials\" authorization grant. If OAuth2 is used, a client, prior to
consuming services offered by the SCEF Northbound APIs, shall obtain a
\"token\" from the authorization server.

7 Using Common API Framework
============================

7.1 General
-----------

When CAPIF is used with the SCEF, the SCEF shall support the following
as defined in 3GPP TS 29.222 \[48\]:

\- the API exposing function and related APIs over CAPIF-2/2e and
CAPIF-3 reference points;

\- the API publishing function and related APIs over CAPIF-4 reference
point;

\- the API management function and related APIs over CAPIF-5 reference
point; and

\- at least one of the the security methods for authentication and
authorization, and related security mechanisms.

In a centralized deployment as defined in 3GPP TS 23.222 \[47\], where
the CAPIF core function and API provider domain functions are
co-located, the interactions between the CAPIF core function and API
provider domain functions may be independent of CAPIF-3, CAPIF-4 and
CAPIF-5 reference points.

When CAPIF is used with the SCEF, the SCEF shall register all the
features for northbound APIs in the CAPIF Core Function.

7.2 Security
------------

When CAPIF is used for external exposure, before invoking the API
exposed by the SCEF, the SCS/AS as API invoker shall negotiate the
security method (PKI, TLS-PSK or OAUTH2) with CAPIF core function and
ensure the SCEF has enough credential to authenticate the SCS/AS (see
3GPP TS 29.222 \[48\], subclause 5.6.2.2 and subclause 6.2.2.2).

If PKI or TLS-PSK is used as the selected security method between the AF
and the NEF, upon API invocation, the NEF shall retrieve the
authorization information from the CAPIF core function as described in
3GPP TS 29.222 \[48\], subclause 5.6.2.4.

As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.122 \[53\], the access to the T8 APIs may be
authorized by means of the OAuth2 protocol (see IETF RFC 6749 \[51\]),
using the \"Client Credentials\" authorization grant, where the CAPIF
core function (see 3GPP TS 29.222 \[48\]) plays the role of the
authorization server.

NOTE 1: In this release, only \"Client Credentials\" authorization grant
is supported.

If OAuth2 is used as the selected security method between the SCS/AS and
the SCEF, the SCS/AS, prior to consuming services offered by the T8
APIs, shall obtain a \"token\" from the authorization server, by
invoking the Obtain\_Authorization service, as described in
3GPP TS 29.222 \[48\], subclause 5.6.2.3.2.

The T8 APIs do not define any scopes for OAuth2 authorization. It is the
SCEF responsibility to check whether the SCS/AS is authorized to use an
API based on the \"token\". Once the SCEF verifies the \"token\", it
shall check whether the NEF identifier in the \"token\" matches its own
published identifier, and whether the API name in the \"token\" matches
its own published API name. If those checks are passed, the AF has full
authority to access any resource or operation for the invoked API.

NOTE 2: The security requirement in the current subclause does not apply
for the MsisdnLessMoSms API since it is the SCEF initiated interaction
with the SCS/AS. How the security scheme works for the MsisdnLessMoSms
API is left to configuration.

NOTE 3: For aforementioned security methods, the SCEF needs to apply
admission control according to access control policies after performing
the authorization checks.

######## Annex A (normative): OpenAPI representation for the APIs defined in the present document

A.1 General
-----------

This Annex is based on the OpenAPI 3.0.0 specification \[27\] and
provides corresponding representations of all APIs defined in the
present specification.

NOTE 1: An OpenAPIs representation embeds JSON Schema representations of
HTTP message bodies.

This Annex shall take precedence when being discrepant to other parts of
the specification with respect to the encoding of information elements
and methods within the API(s).

NOTE 2: The semantics and procedures, as well as conditions, e.g. for
the applicability and allowed combinations of attributes or values, not
expressed in the OpenAPI definitions but defined in other parts of the
specification also apply.

Informative copies of the OpenAPI specification files contained in this
3GPP Technical Specification are available on a Git-based repository
that uses the GitLab software version control system (see clause 5B of
the 3GPP TR 21.900 \[58\] and subclause 5.3.1 of the
3GPP TS 29.501 \[49\] for further information).

A.2 Data Types applicable to several APIs
-----------------------------------------

For the purpose of referencing entities in the Open API file defined in
this Annex, it shall be assumed that this Open API file is contained in
a physical file named \"TS29122\_CommonData.yaml\".

NOTE: For the purpose of referencing the error status codes in the Open
API file defined in this Annex, this Open API file contains all the
mandatory status codes as defined in table 5.2.6-1, all the API specific
error status codes defined for T8 APIs, in addition, some error status
codes not used in the current release of this specification but for the
purpose of referencing by other specifications.
